Antonio Rudiger has recorded the highest top speed in the Premier League this season, surprisingly beating the likes of Mohamed Salah and Adama Traore in the pace stakes. The Chelsea defender has been clocked at 36.7km/h, according to Opta, just pipping Salah and Traore to the highest speed this campaign so far. The Liverpool and former Wolves man have been recorded at 36.6 km/h, with Reds defender Ibrahima Konate (36.2), Aston Villa forward Ollie Watkins (36.1) and Leicester striker Patson Daka (36.1) next in line. It is a hugely impressive statistic for Rudiger to hold and another reason Chelsea will miss him next season if he does indeed leave when his contract expires in the summer. The Germany international has been at Stamford Bridge since 2017 but has not agreed a new deal and looks set to move on at the end of the campaign. Real Madrid appears the most likely destination, although the 29-year-old has been able to agree a move to a foreign club since January and is yet to do so, keeping other parties in the hunt. Juventus and Bayern Munich have also been touted as possible destinations for the centre-back, but similarly no agreement has been reached. Manchester United and Newcastle United may offer Rudiger the chance to stay in the Premier League, while Chelsea would still like to keep hold of him, but cannot give any players a new contract under the current sanctions imposed by the UK government on owner Roman Abramovich. Rudiger has racked up 191 appearances for the Blues since arriving from Roma for £29m, winning the Champions League, FA Cup an Europa League, although the Premier League has escaped him.
