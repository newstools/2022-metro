A Kill the Bill protester has been jailed for nine months for arson over the torching of a police car during a riot. Jasmine York led chants of ‘f*** the f***ing feds’ as a crowd marched on Bristol’s Bridewell police station. She was filmed pushing a bin towards the car — which was already alight — in an apparent bid to add fuel to the blaze. Judge James Paterson said she caused ‘very serious damage’. He added: ‘You played your part in continuing the lawlessness. Your actions made a difficult situation even worse. ‘There is no issue that you didn’t know what you were doing.’ York had attended a Bristol vigil in memory of Sarah Everard, the victim of killer cop Wayne Couzens, at 2pm on March 21 last year. She then joined marchers showing their opposition to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, which would boost powers to curb protests. The 26-year-old, of Bristol, denied being an instigator of the ensuing riot, saying she put herself between the crowd and officers as she knew she would not retaliate against police. Asked why she had livestreamed the clash, she said it was ‘for the safety of others’. York, who who was struck by batons and bitten by a police dog, admitted she had been ‘a bit rude’ by calling police f***ing feds and bastards. But Russell Fraser, defending, said she had a personality disorder and was ‘not a risk to anyone’. A jury cleared her of rioting and arson reckless as to whether life was endangered, but convicted her of arson at Bristol Crown Court. Detective superintendent James Riccio said: ‘She may not have physically attacked officers but she added fuel to the fire of a burning police car, creating an intimidating atmosphere for officers.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
