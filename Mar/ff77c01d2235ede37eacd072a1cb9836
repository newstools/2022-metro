Katie Price’s sister Sophie has revealed she’s engaged to her partner Harry Brooks. The 32-year-old announced the exciting news on Sunday morning just hours after it was reported Katie had split from Carl Woods. Sophie shared a picture of her engagement ring on Instagram alongside the caption: ‘Well I didn’t expect that round the fire pit last night…I said YES!!! #imengaged #yes #summerwedding.’ Her loved ones flooded the snap with their congratulations, including Katie’s ex-boyfriend Kris Boyson, who wrote: ‘Your stuck with that ballbag @harrybrooks88 for the rest of your life now? Your mental girl!’ Katie herself posted a number of red love heart emojis. Sophie became a mother last year, welcoming her son Albert into the world last September. ‘So proud of my sister @sophie_pricey and Harry unfortunately I wasn’t able to be at the hospital because of covid but were with them all the way through!’ Katie wrote at the time. ‘I love you sophie and Harry and my gorgeous nephew Albert ❤️ welcome to the parent world and lack of sleep 🤣🤣🤣🤣.’ Last night, it was reported that Katie and Carl had parted ways having become engaged in April last year. Earlier in the week, the former glamour model was pictured walking hand-in-hand with her fiancé as a show of support as he made an appearance in court, in an effort to ‘try to get his charges dropped’ for ‘threatening and abusive behaviour’. Carl, 33, appeared at Colchester Magistrates’ Court charged under Section 4 of the Public Order Act, after Essex Police confirmed the charges in a statement released in February. However, despite the demonstration of support from Price, 43, just a few days ago, it has been claimed that the couple are now no longer together. Several sources who are reportedly close to them both are said to have told The Sun: ‘Katie and Carl have decided to split up. ‘It’s been a difficult couple of months and their ongoing court cases have just added even more stress to the situation’. The news of their apparent split comes after fans questioned why Katie was seen without her engagement ring on Instagram, as Carl appeared to delete all pictures of the model from his profile on the social media platform. Last month, he denied hitting or punching Price in an incident which occurred last summer, with the former I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! star also insisting that he did not touch her. In videos previously shared on his Instagram Story, Carl explained that he was charged with a public order offence, which he said was ‘just arguing in the street and using foul language’. ‘That’s what I’ve been charged with. Nowhere have they said that I’ve been charged with assault on Kate or actually anything to do with the incident in August, because I wasn’t, it was nothing to do with me,’ he said, adding: ‘Everything I say I’ve got proof of and I will show it.’ Got a story?
