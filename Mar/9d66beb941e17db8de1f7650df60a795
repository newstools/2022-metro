A 22-year-old man has been charged with the murder of 19-year-old Sabita Thanwani. The student was found suffering from serious injuries at her university accommodation in Clerkenwell, central London, shortly after 5am on Saturday. Despite the best efforts of the emergency services, Sabita was pronounced dead at the scene. Maher Maaroufe, 22, was charged with murder as well as assaulting an emergency worker, Scotland Yard confirmed today. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as sharp force trauma to the neck. In a heartbreaking tribute, Sabita’s family said she was ‘an angel’ who ‘was pure and did not see bad in anyone’. ‘Sabita was the most caring and loving person we have ever known,’ the family said. ‘She inspired us every day of her precious 19 years of life. Her mission was to help everyone.’ According to the family statement, Sabita was studying psychology at City University. Maaroufe, of no fixed address, will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court later today. Detectives from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command are investigating her death and continue to provide support to her family. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
