UFC rivals Colby Covington and Jorge Masvidal brawled at a Miami restaurant with the police called to the incident on Monday night. Covington and Masvidal are former teammates, training partners and close friends but have shared a bitter rivalry in recent years, culminating in their meeting at UFC 272 at the start of March. Covington won that battle but the war has continued with the two involved in a ‘physical altercation’ at the Papi Steak restaurant in Miami. Reports claim Masvidal arrived at the restaurant shortly after Covington shared a video of himself eating there. TMZ has shared footage of Covington stood outside the restaurant after the incident surrounded by police. The clip also shows the welterweight speaking to Instagram star Bob Menery, asking him: ‘How would he know I’m here?’  TMZ add Covington was leaving the premises when Masvidal attacked him outside. Shortly after the incident, Masvidal shared his own message on social media. ‘Call this the show your face challenge,’ Masvidal said. ‘You talk that s**t, you gotta back it up, that’s how my city rolls, man.’ Covington claimed an unanimous decision win over Masvidal in their grudge match earlier this month. Their bitter feud stems from Covington’s alleged non-payment of Masvidal’s long-time striking coach Paulino Hernandez, with the two thrown out of Florida’s American Top Team Gym as a result. Masvidal would later return with Covington joining rival gym MMA Masters.
