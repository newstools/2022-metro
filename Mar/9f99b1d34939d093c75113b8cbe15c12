Ralf Rangnick has confirmed Bruno Fernandes misses Manchester United’s clash with Tottenham through illness. The Portugal international has started 26 of United’s 28 league games this season but will sit out this evening after missing training on Friday. The United boss remains hopeful Fernandes will recover in time for United’s Champions League second leg showdown against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday. ‘Bruno got ill yesterday, he couldn’t train and he cannot play, hopefully he’ll be back for Tuesday but today he is out,’ Rangnick told MUTV ahead of kick-off. David de Gea was considered a doubt after reports emerged that he had failed a Covid test on Friday. Rangnick has now clarified that was a false positive with the Spaniard again named ahead of Dean Henderson in the starting XI. ‘We had a false positive test on David last night but we decided to have a second test, that was negative, then a PCR was negative and that’s why we can play him.’ Cristiano Ronaldo and Marcus Rashford are also back in the side, joining Jadon Sancho in attack. Ronaldo missed last Sunday’s 4-1 defeat to Manchester City through a hip injury while Rashford has been out of favour in recent weeks, named among the subs in United’s last four league games prior to today. Explaining their inclusion, Rangnick said: ‘We wanted to play with three offensive players so that’s why I decided to play Cristiano and Marcus at the same time.’ United can move back into the top four with a victory over Antonio Conte’s side tonight.
