A man has been left fighting for his life after allegedly being run over by a drunk driver with children and a dog in the car. He was hit at around 4.15pm on Friday before police discovered the vehicle had been dumped outside a Morrisons supermarket. Pictures show a damaged bumper and a shattered windscreen as specialist investigators tried to piece together what had happened. Witnesses in Walsall, the West Midlands, said they saw a blue Citroen car being driven at speed by a woman with children and a dog inside. Not long after police arrested a 35-year-old woman on suspicion of dangerous driving and being unfit to drive through drink and drugs, the Express and Star reports. The injured man was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to hospital in a critical condition. A West Midlands Police spokesman said: ‘The injured man has been taken to hospital in a critical condition and the road remains cordoned off while we carry out enquiries. ‘Anyone who was in the area at the time and has information is asked to contact us via Live Chat on our website or by calling 101.
