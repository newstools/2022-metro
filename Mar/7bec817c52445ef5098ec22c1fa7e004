Children can make their pocket money go further this Mother’s Day. Morrisons has launched a ‘pocket money menu’ with low cost items so that kids can afford to treat their mums this Sunday. Every item on the menu no more than 99p, and the cheapest is 35p – so the gifts shouldn’t break the piggy bank. The items up for grabs are simple and comforting, from tea and coffee to toasted teacakes and crumpets. Morrisons doughnuts are available too, at the low end of the price spectrum. According to RoosterMoney, the average pocket money for 4-10 year olds is £4.12 per week, so for many children this menu will fall in ‘budget’. Ali Lyons, Head of Café at Morrisons, says: ‘Mums are always finding ways to brighten our day. ‘We hope that our 99p Pocket Money Menu will help sons and daughters to show mum their appreciation and spend some quality time together.’ On top of this, Morrisons is bringing back their ‘feed the family’ offer which comes in at just £10 across their cafes nationwide. The deal will be running for the week due to Mother’s Day. Meals up for grabs include family favourites like fish and chips, lasagne, jacket potatoes and burgers. For kids, the offer includes smaller portions of chicken nuggets or macaroni cheese. The sweetest of gifts aren’t always the most costly – after all, it’s the thought and company that counts.
