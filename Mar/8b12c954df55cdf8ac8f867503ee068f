Tesco shopping bags were changed to be more sustainable in recent years, given the move towards having a ‘bag for life’, but we all remember how the OG carriers used to look. White with blue stripes and a red logo, that’s the Tesco bag we all carted groceries back home in. Perhaps designer brand Balenciaga were inspired by this memory, because their new shopper – costing £925 – looks strikingly similar. Not only does it use the same colours, but ‘Balenciaga’ is written across the bag in  the same spot as the Tesco logo on their 1980s carrier. This isn’t the first time the designer brand has been mocked for a bag design. In 2017, they came out with a style that looked very similar to the iconic blue Ikea bag – for over £1,000. This latest bag from Balenciaga is part of their spring 2022 collection, and it’s made using calfskin with a snap closure fastening and an inner zip pocket. Balenciaga says the bag is a ‘modern interpretation of archetypal bag [sic]’. The supermarket look is in, apparently. Do you have a story to share?
