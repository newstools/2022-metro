A pilot has been charged with attempting to fly illegal immigrants into the UK on his aircraft. Richard Styles, of no fixed abode, was detained during an operation led by the National Crime Agency (NCA) on Thursday at Deenethorpe Airfield near Corby in Northamptonshire. The 52-year-old had just flown his twin-engine plane to the airfield from Belgium. Northamptonshire Police officers, who were working with the NCA, stopped a taxi which had left the airfield on the Phoenix Parkway in Corby, and arrested the driver along with four Albanian nationals. Styles and the taxi driver, a 42-year-old man from Tooting in south London, were questioned by NCA investigators. Styles was charged with facilitating a breach of immigration law and will appear at Northampton Magistrates’ Court on Saturday. The taxi driver has been bailed pending further inquiries. The Albanian nationals, three men and a woman all aged between 21 and 64, remain detained under immigration powers. The operation was also supported by Border Force and Immigration Enforcement. Jacque Beer, NCA regional head of investigations, said: ‘We know people smugglers use a range of methods to try and breach UK border controls and we remain alive to the threats. ‘Working with our law enforcement partners we are determined to do all we can to stop them. ‘The aviation and local community can play a vital role in preventing border crime, and whether you work in the aviation industry, are a keen pilot, or live locally, you should report any unusual or suspicious activity at a UK airfield or airport immediately.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
