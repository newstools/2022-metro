Donald Trump has suggested the US military could disguise its aircraft using Chinese flags and then use them to bomb Russia. He joked that starting a war with China could distract Moscow and bring its invasion of Ukraine to an end. Trump made the comments at the Republican National Committee’s New Orleans retreat on Saturday night. He suggested putting China’s flag on American F-22 jets and using them to ‘bomb the s**t’ out of Russia’.

Then they start fighting with each other, and we sit back and watch.’ Trump also called Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attack on Ukraine a ‘massive crime against humanity’ and described the NATO alliance as a ‘paper tiger.’ During his time in the White House, he repeatedly criticised the military alliance and came close to pulling the US out of the treaty. Trump appears to have changed his tune a bit, having described Putin’s moves as ‘genius’ and ‘savvy’ as troops crossed the border into Ukraine. Predictably, the one-term President then lashed out at the ‘fake news’ media and some Republicans for ‘misrepresenting’ his remarks. He added: ‘They know this terrible war being waged against Ukraine would have never happened under my watch.’ This week Trump also claimed he got on ‘great’ with Putin and said he wouldn’t have dared invade Ukraine while he was in office because he’d ‘hit Moscow’. At last week’s Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump voiced his support for the ‘proud people of Ukraine’ and called President Volodymyr Zelensky a ‘brave man’. He added: ‘God bless them, they are indeed brave, as everyone understand this horrific disaster would never have happened if our election was not rigged and if I was president.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
