Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba has taken a fresh swipe at his club by claiming it’s a ‘breath of fresh air’ to play for France. The 29-year-old dug out Ralf Rangnick and his team-mates earlier this week when he said he had no defined role at Old Trafford and that he was disappointed with how the last five years have gone in the north-west. Pogba is out of contract at the end of the season and he looks set to leave on a free transfer, six years after rejoining the club in a £89million deal. The midfielder’s made a habit of saving media duties until he’s on international duty, when he can conduct interviews in French. And Pogba took another dig at United today by saying it’s a ‘breath of fresh air’ when he can go on international duty to play for France. Asked if playing for France was a ‘breath of fresh air’, Pogba replied: ‘Totally. That’s the truth. There were difficult moments at Manchester United and I needed this break to regain my energy and confidence. ‘Sometimes when I wasn’t playing or the results weren’t good, coming here, it gives a boost, a breath of air that also helps me to come back well to my club. ‘The season is not over yet, but almost because we don’t have any more titles to play for. I want to win titles, to play for something and this year and the last few years we haven’t won a title. It’s sad.’ Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid are the leading contenders for Pogba’s signature, though he has received interest from the Premier League. Aston Villa and Newcastle are said to be the two interested parties from England, with the ambitious pair hoping to persuade Pogba to stay in the Premier League.
