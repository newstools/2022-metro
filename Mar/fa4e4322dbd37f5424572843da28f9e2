Jermain Defoe has announced his retirement from football. The 39-year-old, who made his professional debut for West Ham in 2000, scored 305 goals in 764 appearances during his career. Defoe went on to play for Tottenham, Portsmouth, Sunderland and Bournemouth in the Premier League, while he also won the Scottish Premiership with Rangers last year and spent a season at Toronto FC in Major League Soccer. He scored 20 goals in 57 appearances for England and was part of the World Cup squad in 2010. Defoe ended his playing career at Sunderland after signing a short-term deal with the League One club in January. A statement from Defoe released on Thursday read: ‘After 22 years in the game, I have decided to retire from professional football. It’s been a really tough decision, and one I have discussed with my family and those closest to me. ‘I made my professional debut at 17-years-old in 1999, and I feel now is the right time to bow out. I have had an incredible journey, and have met some amazing people in the game. Football will always remain in my blood, and it gives me great pride and satisfaction to look back on the blessed career that I’ve had. ‘I now look forward to spending some quality time with my friends and family before moving forward on this next chapter in my career. Thank you to all the fans from each club I’ve played for. ‘Thee love I have received and endured throughout my career will never be forgotten, and I will always have a special bond with you all. Thank you also to my amazing team mates, coaches, and staff for playing such an integral part in my career. ‘Lastly, I want to say thank you to my mum. You gave me a ball at two years old, and you made me believe my dream could happen. All that I am is because of you, and I owe everything to you and God.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
