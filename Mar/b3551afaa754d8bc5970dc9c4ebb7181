A suspected ‘robber’ has escaped from a prison van wearing just his pants and socks. Dorset Police is carrying out ‘extensive searches’ to find Kyle Eglington, 32, and are appealing to the public to help catch him. Eglington made off from a court prisoner transit van in Hardy Road, Poole, after assaulting security officers at 11.12am yesterday. Detectives revealed he was barely dressed when he made his getaway bid. Eglington has been described as white, five feet 11 inches tall and of medium build, with dark brown hair and a beard. He was remanded in custody after being charged with robbery in relation to an incident in Bournemouth on Thursday and appeared at Poole Magistrates’ Court the next day. The area is being searched with assistance from a police helicopter and the British Transport Police. People who have seen a man in ‘just his underwear and socks’ are being urged to report it. Superintendent Heather Dixey said: ‘I would like to reassure members of the public that we have a number of officers carrying out searches and other enquiries in a bid to locate Kyle Eglington as soon as possible and return him to lawful custody. ‘I would urge anyone who has sees a man in the area in just his underwear and socks, or who matches the description given above and appears to be avoiding detection, to please report it to us. ‘There is nothing at this time to suggest he poses a risk to the general public, however, we would urge people not to approach him and to please dial 999 immediately. ‘There will be an extensive police presence in the area as we carry out these enquiries and officers can be approached by members of the community with any concerns.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
