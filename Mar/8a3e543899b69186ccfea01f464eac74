Manchester United are yet to agree the nature of Ralf Rangnick’s role with the club next season, despite the German accepting a two-year offer to become a consultant for the Red Devils. Rangnick was placed in interim charge of the club in December, with United keen to have a short-term solution to their problems as they seek to appoint a new long-term manager. On his appointment, it was also announced that Rangnick would take on a two-year consultancy at the club after his departure from Lokomotiv Moscow. But Rangnick has been preoccupied with his role as interim boss, while United’s board are yet to decide on who to appoint at the end of the season. It means Rangnick’s future role has not been outlined and the club are unclear over what capacity he will hold next season. Sky Sports claim United do not envisage the role being ‘hands on’, meaning Rangnick will likely take on a more advisory-based role. The German specialises in structuring clubs, working behind-the-scenes on every level to ensure what materialises on the pitch is a winning model. However, after years of Ed Woodward in charge, United are now guided by Richard Arnold and he is already looking to hire a deputy to help him with the day-to-day running of the club. After squandering around £1.2bn in the transfer market since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, United are keen to tap into greater expertise over decision-making and Rangnick will likely be consulted about the club’s set-up, scouting and structure.
