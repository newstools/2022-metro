Fears of a ‘large-scale ecological disaster’ have grown as Russian military fire rockets at a physics institute containing nuclear material and a reactor. Ukraine’s national security service said Vladimir Putin’s forces were firing at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology using Grad launchers. These missiles do not have precise targeting, raising concerns that it could damage the reactor and release radioactive material across Europe. It comes two days after Russian forces shelled Europe’s largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia, prompting fears of a repeat of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.

He said he was ‘very confident’ the move was being discussed due to disastrous consequences at stake. Raab added: ‘I think it’s the specific technical issues plus the reassurance that not just Ukraine needs, but Europe and the rest of the world, given the potential global reach of a disaster like that.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
