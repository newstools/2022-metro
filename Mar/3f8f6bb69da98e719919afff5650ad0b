Paris Saint-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino would desperately fight to keep Marcus Rashford should he take charge at Manchester United this summer. Rashford, 24, is considering his future at the Theatre of Dreams after falling out of favour under Ralf Rangnick. The England international’s scored just twice since October and his last start came on February 12th against Southampton, when he failed to impress from the right flank. Rashford has 18 months to left on his deal at Old Trafford and he’s open to leaving this summer, particularly given the uncertainty over United’s next manager. Pochettino is a leading candidate for the role and the Daily Mail say the Argentine would fight hard to keep Rashford should he be appointed. In fact, Pochettino tried to sign Rashford last summer for PSG and he’s always been a huge fan of the England forward. The Ligue 1 giants remain keen on Rashford and will push to sign him should Kylian Mbappe join Real Madrid on a free transfer. But that could be complicated by any attempt that United make to appoint Pochettino, as the Argentine would try to block the club’s move to sign Rashford. On the flip side, should United pick Erik Ten Hag over Pochettino, then the Argentine will encourage PSG to make a move for Rashford.
