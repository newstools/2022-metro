The 31-year-old left her opponent out cold on the canvas after the incredible finish to their contest in the third round at the O2 Arena in London, sprinting around the Octagon in celebration. McCann dominated her Brazilian opponent in the first round with Carolina offering sterner resistance in a closer second. She was caught blindsided however as McCann caught her flush with an elbow that extends the Liverpudlian’s record to 12-4. There was British success almost across the board in the capital with Tom Aspinall dominating Alexander Povetkin their main event clash. The 28-year-old heavyweight took a commanding step into his division’s top 10 by becoming the first man since 2010 to submit the battle-hardened Russian, getting the job done inside the first round. Arnold Allen also wasted little time in getting what is the biggest win of his career to date against Dan Hooker with a punch-perfect display. The featherweight blasted his opponent with an array of vicious shots from the opening bell with the referee stepping in to end the contest midway through the first round. Scouse sensation Paddy Pimblett put on another show in his second UFC fight, getting the submission win over Kazula Vargas.
