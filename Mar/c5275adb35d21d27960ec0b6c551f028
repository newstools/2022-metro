Kate Middleton continues her run of excellent fashion choices during her and Prince William’s tour of the Caribbean, this time landing in the Bahamas in an on-theme dress that matches the country’s flag. The outfit putting our plane-wear to shame: an aquamarine dress by Emilia Wickstead, in a classic cut – midi length, nipped in at the waist, and with collar detailing inspired by the label’s AW22 collection. Emilia Wickstead is a go-to designer for the Duchess of Cambridge. The same day, as she departed Jamaica, Kate rewore a green Emilia Wickstead dress along with a brooch. At some point on the plane, it seems the royal opted to swap for a shade to match the blue stripes on the Bahamas flag. She also managed to trade a low bun for a jaunty ponytail, and swapped smaller huggie earrings for dangling turquoise hoops – we believe these £100 Taylor earrings from Sezane. Yes, this does make us feel a bit rubbish about how we look when coming off a flight, but anyway, back to the dress. Alas, this is another custom-made piece, so we don’t have a price handy. But Kate’s green dress by the same designer is priced at £1,380 – so there’s your ballpark. Please also note Kate’s exactly matching envelope clutch bag – surely another custom-made accessory.
