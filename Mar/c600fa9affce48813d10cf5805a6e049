A writer on The Simpsons has insisted a recent gay joke about Carl and Lenny was written especially ‘for gay people’. The landmark episode Portrait of a Lackey on Fire saw Waylon Smithers finally find love with a famous fashion designer, and his new boyfriend Michael Le Graaf mistook Lenny and Karl for a couple. When Michael started critiquing the Springfield residents’ outfits, Lenny stepped forward and asks what the expert thinks of his top… Michael subsequently looked at Carl and said: ‘Very nice.’ Johnny LaZebnik, who wrote the episode with his dad Rob LeZebnik, told Attitude: ‘I’m a huge Lenny and Carl fan… We worked on that scene a bunch of times, and I was like, “How can we get this joke to stay in?” ‘There are a lot of jokes for gay people that I had a hand in getting in there.’ Rob, however, wasn’t sure people would ‘get the reference’. ‘I was like, “We’ve got a Chernobyl parody! We’re doing this!”’ he told the magazine. The episode was a monumental moment for the Simpsons with Smithers being a main player in the cartoon since it began in 1989. He officially came out as gay in 2016 after pining over Mr Burns for 27 years, and then found love five years later with Michael. Johnny previously told the AV Club: ‘‘When we, my dad and I, talked about writing this episode, something that was important to me was to see his relationship grow and flourish and to get those intimate moments of two gay people on screen talking about being gay or dating. ‘To have a gay romance be the A-story of a Simpsons episode, I don’t think has ever happened. And that’s what was so exciting to me.’ The Simpsons is available to stream on Disney+. Got a story?
