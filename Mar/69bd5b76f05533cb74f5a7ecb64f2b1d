Alison Steadman and Larry Lamb reunited on This Morning but things got a bit chaotic as the actress couldn’t recall a recent lunch she’d had with her co-star. The much-loved pair joined Alison Hammond and Dermot O’Leary as they spoke about their campaigning for charity Marie Curie. But towards the end of the segment, host Alison obviously wanted to quiz the pair about their time on Gavin and Stacey. With fans always eager to find out whether there’s more in the pipeline, the This Morning presenter asked: ‘Is this the first time you’ve met since the Christmas special?’ ‘No, we saw each other the other week, didn’t we – at that lunch? Do you remember the lunch?’ Larry shared. However, things soon took a hilarious turn as guest Alison struggled to jog her memory, with Larry adding: ‘Mike’s lunch?’ ‘That clearly went well for you Alison,’ Dermot laughed, as she carried on trying to remember what on earth he was talking about. ‘Not the other week!’ The Pam Shipman actress replied as it was clear she still had no clue. ‘It was the end of the year wasn’t it, we all had lunch,’ Larry added. Hosts Alison and Dermot kept giggling away as Alison replied in a joking voice: ‘Oh sorry dear, I don’t know!’ She leant her ear towards Larry, teasing: ‘What was that dear?’ ‘Do you remember that? Where we sat kissing for three-quarters of an hour?’ leading to Alison jokingly whacking her arm in his direction: ‘Oh shush!’ ‘Larry, I have this every week, don’t worry,’ Dermot told him, as Larry pointed to his fellow guest asking: ‘Who’s she?’ ‘She’s still thinking about it!’ presenter Alison remarked, with Dermot concluding: ‘You should have launched a short-term memory loss appeal.’ They all struggled to stifle their laughter as the interview came to an end, with fans loving the brilliant TV moment. One wrote on Twitter: Loving Alison Steadman 😂🤣 #ThisMorning.’ A fan added: ‘I so relate. Alison is me when I’ve had a drink. I have no memory of where I was or what I did 😂🤦🏻‍♀️  #ThisMorning.’ Alison really enjoyed that lunch then 🤣🤣🤣 #ThisMorning,’ shared another. Unfortunately, we didn’t get that all-important question asked of whether there’d be more Gavin and Stacey to come – so you’ll have to keep watching this space. Got a story?
