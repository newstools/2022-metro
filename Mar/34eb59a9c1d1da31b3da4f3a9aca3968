Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has named Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel as his preferred options to become new permanent manager at Old Trafford. Mauricio Pochettino is the leading target to become the new manager at the end of the season with the Argentine reportedly on the brink at Paris Saint-Germain following last week’s Champions League exit. Ajax boss Erik ten Hag is also under consideration with the Dutchman said to be Ralf Rangnick’s preferred option, with the interim boss set to move into an advisory role this summer. Tuchel however is also believed to be on United’s radar after Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government, leaving Chelsea in a precarious situation. Scholes believes the German could come in and ‘strike fear’ into the under-perfomrming stars at Old Trafford, also naming Tottenham boss Conte, who was linked with the job last year, as a candidate to lift the club out of their malaise. ‘I would have gone for Conte or Tuchel now,’ Scholes told BT Sport. ‘Possibly it looks like he [Tuchel] might be available at the end of the year. Those two are top class elite coaches who I think strike fear into players and win which is the most important thing. ‘United with either one of those coaches would be a much better squad. ‘Okay, they need additions. But I hate it when people say they need four or five players or need to spend £200million or whatever it is. ‘There is a group of players here that I think can be made a lot better by top quality elite coaches.’ MORE : ‘We did almost everything wrong’ – Ralf Rangnick warns Manchester United squad before Atletico clash MORE : Jaap Stam sends warning to Manchester United over appointing Erik ten Hag as manager For more stories like this, check our sport page.
