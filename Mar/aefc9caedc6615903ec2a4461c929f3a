Police have closed three lanes of the M4 after a man was found dead near the motorway in the early hours of Friday morning. An investigation into the discovery could take several days, and drivers have been urged to find alternative routes if they can. The man’s death is currently being treated as unexplained, and he is yet to be formally identified. Road closures have been in place on the M4 westbound, between Junction 4B (M25) and Junction 5 (Langley).
