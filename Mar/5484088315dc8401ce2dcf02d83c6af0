A pub boss has been branded ‘out of touch’ for putting on an event with a topless barmaid pulling pints. But landlord Glenn Chadwick hit back at critics, saying that the stunt was ‘no different from hosting a stag do’. He staged a second evening that saw several barmaids wear ‘sexy outfits’ to pour pints for punters at Hardy’s in Dorchester, Dorset. And following complaints that the events were degrading to women, he said: ‘I have spoken to licensing at the council and they have told me I’m legally allowed to do it. ‘They don’t like it and would prefer I would not hold these events but it’s no different to having a stripper come in for a stag do.’ Mr Chadwick, whose venue is near the idyllic Poundbury urban extension created by Prince Charles, added: ‘I would tell people who have a problem to not come to these nights out. ‘No-one is forcing them to. The events were held between 10pm and midnight, and they were not for men only. ‘Women were also in attendance, some of whom were wearing less than the barmaids.’ He said licensing laws allowed him to hold a topless night ‘once every 28 days’, and he can hold no more than 11 events per year. The pub boss admitted he had been having second thoughts about the events in light of the furore. ‘After the abuse I’ve got from some people, I’ve been put off from holding any more in the future,’ he said. Dorset Council said that it had raised concerns about the nights with the pub’s ‘area manager and the matter has now been resolved’.
