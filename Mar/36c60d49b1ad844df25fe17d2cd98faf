If you live around London, you might have noticed the sky looks a bit apocalyptic today. Eerie images taken in the capital show the streets being lit with a strange sepia coloured glow. A phenomenon known as ‘blood rain’ is expected to hit the city today, with drops leaving red deposits on everything they touch. ‘There is a really horrible coloured sky in West London this morning. Everything has a slight green tinge about it… Disconcerting,’ Deborah Wastell tweeted. ‘Anyone notice the sky over london is a weird yellow sepia colour?! what is happening? is a weird yellow sepia colour?! what is happening?’ another wrote. But don’t panic, the world isn’t ending – the creepy weather is being caused by a Saharan dust cloud making its way across Europe. It comes after parts of southern Spain were been blanketed following a thick plume, with satellite images clearly showing the dust over France. As the red dust is carried in the air, it mixes with rain, giving the appearance of blood falling from the sky. Saharan dust was whipped up by Storm Celia as a plume of hot air moved across Europe, including parts of Spain and Switzerland. Met Office forecaster Richard Miles said: ‘The orange effect is caused by the Rayleigh scattering, which is the same effect that gives you the blue sky. ‘The additional dust will scatter the blue light and create more red light effects which gives sunsets their distinctive colour. ‘So the more layers of dust in the atmosphere the right conditions will give you orange and red tints to the sky.’ He said no disruption expected as there was no ‘significant quantities’ of dust to affect air quality. He said the main difference will be what people see in the sky, but he warned some people might find some dusty residue left on their car windscreens.
