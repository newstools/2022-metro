The weather’s getting warmer, which means beer gardens and al fresco entertaining is on the cards. If you’re having people over, The Range is selling a gazebo that’s perfect for guests. Not only does it provide shelter if we get a spot of rain (pretty much guaranteed here in Blighty) it also turns into a bar, so you can serve your loved ones drinks in style. With a black metal frame and cream canvas canopy it’s bang on trend, and also comes with two matching stools. Stock up the temporary pub’s glass and metal shelves with your favourite beverages, or remove the bar if you just want the gazebo itself. It’s currently on sale at The Range, priced at £249.99 – £150 off the original RRP – making it a bargain compared to similar options. Smaller tiki-style bars will typically set you back upwards of £300, while more permanent structures available from UK retailers are priced in the thousands. You can get your hands on this one in The Range stores and on the website, but bear in mind that delivery costs £9.95 if you order online. Factor in dispatch times to your party plans too, as the estimated delivery date if you order this gazebo today is April 8. Shortages related to Brexit and the pandemic has made it difficult to find garden furniture in stock over the last year or two. Now stock levels are returning to normal, we imagine sets like these will be snapped up fast. Basically, if you’ve got your eye on something, snap it up when you can. If you miss out on this cut-price home pub at The Range, Studio has an almost identical charcoal grey set available for £299. Then all you need to sort is the guest list and drinks menu… Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
