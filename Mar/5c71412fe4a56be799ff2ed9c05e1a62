The reign of grey and neutral homeware is officially over, and the age of maximalism is here. Bright colours and bold prints are the order of the day when it comes to stylish interiors, with ‘dopamine decorating’ and twee fashion inspiring the technicolour trend. As well as a more joyful colour palette, we’re seeing a move towards a quaint and cutesy aesthetic over the industrial and Scandi styles that have dominated for the last few years. Scalloped edges are reminiscent of doilies and school socks, but after something of a grownup makeover it’s the pattern you’ll be spotting everywhere. Trays from Accessorize bearing the squiggly design are all over TikTok, and Oliver Bonas’ shelves are packed with waves and ripples (as I’m sure your Instagram feed is to). The key is to merge the nautical shell shape with luxe fabrics and offbeat hues. Think art deco meets your nana’s house, and that’s about the sweet spot.
