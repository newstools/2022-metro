A Russian Foreign Intelligence chief has claimed that the country no longer sees its ‘war’ with the West as cold – and instead branded the situation ‘hot’. That is despite Russia claiming it is not at war with Ukraine – and other western countries staying out of the fighting. Speaking on Thursday as Russia continued to bombard its western-leaning neighbour, Sergei Naryshkin said: ‘Western politicians and commentators like to call what is happening a “new cold war.” ‘It seems that historical parallels are not entirely appropriate here. If only because in the second half of the 20th century Russia fought with the West on the distant approaches, and now the war has come to the very borders of our Motherland.

It comes amid fears that other countries could yet be dragged into the war if Nato countries, including those on the Russian border, are attacked. The battle for Europe’s biggest nuclear plant is currently raging at Zaporizhzhia, where thick black smoke was seen rising into the sky earlier on Thursday. President Vladimir Putin warned France’s leader Emmanuel Macron that he wants to control all of Ukraine and that the ‘worst’ is yet to come. Russia and the West’s war of words has reached new lows in recent days, with Putin’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warning that a Third World War would be ‘nuclear and destructive’.
