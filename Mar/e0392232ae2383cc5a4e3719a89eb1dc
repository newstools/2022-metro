At least one person has died in Italy after a bus carrying about 50 Ukrainian refugees overturned. The incident on a major highway in north-eastern Italy happened at around dawn on Sunday, killing a woman, firefighters say. Italian state radio added that several other people were injured in the accident on the A14 autostrada near Forli, a town in the Emilia-Romagna region. The rest of those on board were safely evacuated, it reported. Images show the vehicle on its side on a grassy slope just beyond a highway guardrail and near a farm field. Firefighters used two cranes to put the bus upright and remove it. The cause of the accident is under investigation. Italy’s Interior Ministry said the vehicle set out from Ukraine and was heading south to Pescara, an Adriatic port city, when it overturned. The ministry added that passengers were taken to a nearby police barracks and given support, before later resuming their journey. Some 35,000 Ukrainian refugees who fled war in their homeland have entered Italy, most of them through its north-eastern border with Slovenia, with pictures showing a number of children in buses. The Emilia-Romagna region borders the Adriatic Sea. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
