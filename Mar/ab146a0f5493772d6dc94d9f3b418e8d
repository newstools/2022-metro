England boss Gareth Southgate says Marcus Rashford’s form must improve if he’s to earn his place back in the Three Lions’ squad. The Manchester United forward was left out of today’s squad for friendlies against Ivory Coast and Switzerland for the upcoming friendlies later this month. Rashford’s form has nosedived at Old Trafford this term and he’s considering leaving his boyhood club due to a lack of playing time. The 24-year-old has been a regular under Southgate, who tends to stay loyal to his players. But Southgate says Rashford is ‘clearly not at his best’ and must improve his performances to win back his place. ‘He’s in the same position as everyone else,’ said Southgate. ‘Whether in or out of the squad [every palyer] has got to play well towards the end of season and next season.‘It’s a difficult time for him. He’s clearly not at his best but there’s plenty of time [before the World Cup].‘We know about Marcus and we know what he can bring to us.’ Rashford has come in for fierce criticism from United supporters this season. Southgate bemoaned the flak that Rashford has received, saying it’s unhelpful for a player to work under those conditions. ‘I think when a team is not doing as well as fans would like always a negative reaction,’ said Southgate. ‘I can’t comment too much on the individual incident only seen one angle of footage‘In terms of any team will want their fans with them to get the best out of playersIt rarely works the other way for teams to improve their performances.’ MORE : Gareth Southgate drops Marcus Rashford from England squad and calls up four Arsenal stars For more stories like this, check our sport page.
