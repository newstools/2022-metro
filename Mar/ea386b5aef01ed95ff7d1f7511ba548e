Denise Van Outen’s former fiance Eddie Boxshall wants to ‘defend himself’ after allegations that she caught him sexting other women. The Gogglebox stars split in January after seven years of dating and it was later claimed that Denise found out he had been ‘cheating’ on her by having phone sex with others during their relationship. Excerpts from her new autobiography, A Bit Of Me, feature Denise, 47, revealing how she searched Eddie’s iPad and confronted a woman who allegedly engaged in phone sex with him. The businessman, 47, appeared to address the claims on Instagram yesterday, with a picture of iconic TV character Inspector Clouseau, perhaps alluding to Denise’s detective skills. He wrote: ‘Inspector Clouseau………. The 2nd worst detective in the world !!! 🔎 🙄 #2sides #holdinghandsup #butdefendingmyself #keepprivatelifeprivate #nolongerbeingcontrolled.’ In her book, Denise explains how she found photos and Instagram messages alluding to phone sex while searching Eddie’s iPad. The former Big Breakfast presenter was then confused to find she had blocked the woman’s profile on Instagram despite never following her. The woman then suggested that Eddie must have blocked her from Denise’s account with her knowing. ‘Her name was Tracy and she had apparently spoken to Eddie over FaceTime and text for a long period — often from our home and sometimes from my flat in Hampstead, which she seemed to think was his,’ the presenter reportedly writes in her memoir. ‘They’d never met in person, but she said the conversations had become sexual reasonably quickly. Some of the stuff I found on the phone seemed to support that. ‘However she was upset with Eddie by then, because he had apparently ghosted her. “I hope you’re not angry with me,” she wrote. “I’m not a homewrecker”.’ Denise also claims to have found photos of another woman’s breasts among the messages on his iPad. The TV star announced she had dumped Eddie earlier this year, but he recently described their relationship as ‘wonderful’ in a tribute to Denise for International Women’s Day. Got a story?
