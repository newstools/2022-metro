Frank Lampard insists the mentality of his Everton players must improve after their defeat to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup on Sunday. Everton were dumped out of the competition following a 4-0 defeat at Selhurst Park. The club have now been beaten five times in eight games since Lampard replaced Rafa Benitez as manager last month. And the former Chelsea boss feels his Everton players are suffering from a loss of confidence. ‘There’s only so much you can keep trying to butter someone up to give them confidence,’ Lampard said after Everton’s defeat to Palace. ‘There’s a balance of confidence, we’re playing at the cut-throat end of football here, it’s a quarter final today to get to Wembley. ‘And if you haven’t got the confidence to play, and I’ll quickly flip it and say, if you haven’t got the bollocks to play, that’s the football reality. If you fall somewhere in the middle, don’t worry about it. ‘We didn’t play that badly today and Palace didn’t play that well and we lost 4-0, because of a lack of confidence and a lack of what I just said. ‘It wasn’t tactics. Tactics showed in the first 20 minutes that Palace couldn’t get out of their half. So when you do things right within that structure you’ll be alright. ‘If you can’t be clinical in front of goal, you won’t score goals, you won’t feel like you’re going to score goals. ‘If you allow people to stroll into your box and finish with ease, they’ll finish with ease, they’ll finish with ease. Real basics.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
