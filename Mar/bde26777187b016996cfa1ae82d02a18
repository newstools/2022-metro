Arsenal have begun talks over a move for Benfica striker Darwin Nunez, according to reports. Mikel Arteta is looking to bolster his squad with a new forward following the decision to allow Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to join Barcelona in the January transfer window. The Gunners are also facing the prospect of losing Alexandre Lacazette at the end of the season as the 30-year-old’s contract is due to expire. Arsenal were left frustrated in their attempts to sign a new striker in January as their top target, Dusan Vlahovic, made the move to Juventus in a £66.6 million deal from Fiorentina. According to the Daily Express, Arsenal have kept up their interest in Real Sociedad striker Alexander Isak, Lille forward Jonathan David and Everton’s Dominic Calvert-Lewin. But the report also claims that the Gunners have already made enquiries about Nunez and have held talks with the Benfica striker’s agent. Nunez has been in sublime form for Benfica this season with 20 goals in the league and four more in the Champions League. The 22-year-old has also scored two goals in eight senior appearances for Uruguay’s national team. Earlier this season, Luis Suarez revealed that he even recommended Nunez to Barcelona’s hierarchy before the Uruguayan joined Benfica. ‘I have 15 years of international experience. I know a thing or two about forwards,’ Suarez revealed. ‘And I told them, ‘pay attention to this one, he’s very good, he shows interesting things’. ‘They told me he was at Almeria and that he was too young. ‘But instead of paying now €80 million, €90m or €100m, they would’ve paid €15m or €20m and have him there as a substitute, a player needs to be empowered.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
