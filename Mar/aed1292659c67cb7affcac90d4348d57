Romelu Lukaku has reportedly been left ‘angered and appalled’ by speculation he’s ready to quit Chelsea in order to return to Inter Milan. Reports in Italy claim the Belgian is prepared to take a pay cut in order to re-join the club who sold him to the Blues for £97.5m last summer. Speculation of the striker wanting out comes with Chelsea’s future being thrown into turmoil after owner Roman Abramovich was hit by sanctions from the UK government amid his alleged links to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who ordered the invasion of Ukraine last month. However, The Telegraph claim Lukaku is upset by the reports in Italy over his future and he feels now more than ever everyone at Chelsea should be sticking together. The 28-year-old has failed to have the impact many hoped since returning to Stamford Bridge and has not scored in the league this year. Lukaku is fighting for a starting spot against the likes of Timo Werner and Kai Havertz and clearly irked his boss back in December after he was dropped by Thomas Tuchel for giving an interview declaring his plans to one day return to Inter. ‘I’m not happy with the situation, this is normal,’ Lukaku told Sky Sport Italia. ‘But I am a worker and I must not give up. ‘I want to say a big apology to the Inter fans because I think the way I left should have been different. ‘I really hope in the depths of my heart to return to Inter, not at the end of my career, but at a still good level to hopefully win more.’ Lukaku is under contract with Chelsea until the summer of 2026.
