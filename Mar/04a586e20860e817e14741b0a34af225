President Joe Biden received his second coronavirus booster shot on camera on Wednesday, a day after the US regulators authorized it for older and immunocompromised Americans. Biden urged Congress to pass more funding for coronavirus vaccines, tests, treatment and masks, then sat down and rolled his sleeve up for his fourth shot. A nurse administered it as the president listened to questions from reporters about the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war and other issues. ‘It didn’t hurt a bit and I was able to roll my sleeve up,’ Biden, 79, said after the shot. ‘Thank you all.’ Biden received his first booster, a third dose of the Pfizer vaccine, on camera on September 27. The president warned that the government will run out of money to purchase vaccine doses, tests and other supplies to combat coronavirus and called on lawmakers to pass more funds immediately. ‘Let’s get this done,’ Biden said. Biden also announced the launch of Covid.gov, a one-stop shop for finding free booster shots, at-home tests, high-quality masks and the latest information on the state of the coronavirus. The White House announced that Biden would get the second booster earlier on Wednesday. ‘Today, following his remarks on the status of the country’s fight against Covid-19, the President will receive his second Covid-19 booster shot,’ the White House stated. ‘The shot will be administered by a member of the White House Medical Unit.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
