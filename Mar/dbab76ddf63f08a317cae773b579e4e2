Prince William and his father Charles have posted a series of touching tributes to the Queen on International Women’s Day. The two Kings-in-waiting simultaneously shared photos on their Instagram pages this morning, celebrating the ‘mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and head of state’. International Women’s Day is celebrated every year in honour of the contributions women make to society across the world. For his tribute to arguably the most famous woman on earth, the Duke of Cambridge featured pictures of the 95-year-old through the ages. One picture showed the Queen and the late Prince Philip surrounded by their great-grandchildren at Balmoral Castle in 2018. The ‘relaxed’ monarch holds a then-baby Prince Louis in her arms for the family photo, which was taken by the Duchess of Cambridge. There were more smiles in an image of the Queen along with William and Kate at her beloved Chelsea Flower Show in 2019. A black and white photograph from 1977 showed the Queen being greeted by the crowds during her Silver Jubilee. Another captures a tender moment between Charles and his mother as he kisses her hand at a polo match in 1988. The Duke’s post read: ‘In this very special Platinum Jubilee year, we celebrate Her Majesty The Queen and her historic 70 years of service on International Women’s Day 2022. ‘Mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and Head of State, The Queen’s extraordinary reign has been longer than any other monarch in British history – inspiring a nation and dedicating her life to the service of the Commonwealth and its people.’ The post was echoed on Charles’s account, which an image of Camilla sharing a joke with the Queen during a visit to Dumfries House in 2014.
