Jurgen Klopp is reportedly desperate to sign Jude Bellingham and believes the Borussia Dortmund star is destined to become one of the world’s best. The talented 18-year-old has made a name for himself at the Bundesliga club ever since joining in a £30m deal from Birmingham in 2020. Bellingham has since earned himself 10 caps for England and unsurprisingly Europe’s top clubs are being linked with a potential move, including Liverpool. According to The Sun, Klopp has even told close friends and contacts in football he wants him at Anfield, believing he will soon will be considered one of the best in world football. However, a player of Bellingham’s calibre won’t come cheap and it’s thought Dortmund would want in excess of £100m to even consider doing business with interested parties. Klopp may have to wait a little while too with Bellingham said to be willing to stay at Dortmund for at least another season to continue to develop his game before considering a move. Last month, former England international Owen Hargreaves urged the Premier League’s top clubs to get the cheque book out in order to snap up Bellingham. ‘This kid is so special,’ Hargreaves said. ‘He is probably one of my favourite players in all of Europe to watch. 18 years old, it’s not normal how consistent he is. He’s a leader. ‘In terms of goals and assists, he offers so much. ‘If I was any of the top four teams in the Premier League, I would be getting the cheque book out and signing a cheque. He is too good to pass up. He is the real deal.’ MORE : ‘I can’t believe that’ – Michael Owen stunned by Liverpool’s Champions League chances MORE : Liverpool survive Inter Milan scare to qualify for Champions League quarter-finals For more stories like this, check our sport page.
