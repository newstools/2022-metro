Arsenal have sounded out the possibility of bringing in Brazil manager Tite to replace Mikel Arteta in 2023. The Gunners are currently flying high in fourth place and are in a strong position to qualify for the Champions Leaguer for the first time since the 2016-17 season. Tite’s relationship with Arsenal technical director Edu however could see him arrive in north London in the very near future. According to Globo journalist Eric Faria, Edu wants Tite to become Arsenal’s next manager with negotiations already underway. Faria reported: ‘There is already negotiations for Tite to work in English football. To work at Arsenal. He worked with Edu Gaspar. There is the intention, negotiations have started.’ Tite has served as Brazil’s head coach since 2016 but is expected to leave that post following this year’s World Cup regardless of how the Selecao fare in Qatar. Globo Esporte’s follow-up report claims the plan would then be for him arrive at Arsenal in time for the 2023-24 season Edu and Tite worked closely together at Corinthians and the Brazil national team before the former became Arsenal’s first ever technical director. Arteta was briefly linked with the Barcelona job last year but recent reports have suggested Arsenal are prepared to offer him a huge new contract that will see him become one of the top earning managers in the Premier League. The Sun reported in February that the Spaniard is in line for a new three-year deal. Arteta’s current contract expires in the summer of 2023.
