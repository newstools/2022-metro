Seven civilians have been killed after Russian forces attacked an evacuation convoy near Kyiv, Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency says. Among the victims was a child, and the convoy, carrying people from the village of Peremoha, consisted exclusively of women and children, according to officials. In a statement, the intelligence service said: ‘After the attack, the occupiers forced the remnants of the column to turn back to Peremoha and are not letting them out of the village.’ Russia has continually denied targeting civilians since Vladimir Putin launched his invasion on February 24. But countless pictures of destroyed residential blocks and many reports of dead citizens, including children, paint a very different picture. Russia recently denied bombing a hospital in the city of Mariupol, dismissing the claims as ‘fake news’. Putin’s forces have broken a series of ceasefire agreements, launching shells at besieged cities just hours after announcing they would halt fire to let residents out. But Moscow has tried blaming Ukraine for the breaches, accusing the country of using civilians as human shields. On Monday Russia’s envoy to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, even accused Ukrainians of shelling themselves. His comments sparked outrage in the international community, leading to comparisons to similar claims made by Bosnian Serb forces when they bombed Sarajevo.
