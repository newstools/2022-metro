Rory McIlroy believes it would be ‘phenomenal’ if Tiger Woods can take part in next week’s Masters. Woods has not competed in a top-level event since suffering severe injuries in a car accident in Los Angeles on February 23 last year. The 15-time major winner, who feared at one point his right leg would have to be amputated, played the PNC Championship with his son Charlie in December and had a practice round with Charlie and Justin Thomas at Augusta National on Tuesday. ‘I think for golf and for the Masters tournament and for everyone, to have Tiger there would be phenomenal,’ McIlroy said. ‘It just adds to the event. Anything Tiger Woods does in the game of golf is heightened whenever he’s there. It would be awesome for him to be there.’ Woods won his fifth Masters title in 2019, two years after telling Jack Nicklaus ‘I’m done’ before flying to London for career-saving spinal fusion surgery. Asked if anything Woods did still surprised him, McIlroy added: ‘Yeah, everything. ‘I’ve said this so many times, but from basically March of 2017 fast forward two years and he wins the Masters and where he was with his body and what he had to do to get back to being somewhat healthy. ‘And it’s not even being somewhat healthy, it’s also what he has to do before the round and after the round just to get himself ready to go and play. ‘The sheer will and perseverance is incredible. If he comes back from this again, it’s just, he likes to prove people wrong, he likes to prove himself wrong.’ MORE : Tiger Woods plays full round at Augusta ahead of possible Masters comeback MORE : Tiger Woods’ daughter, 14, recalls fears for father’s life during horror car crash: ‘We didn’t know if you’d come home with two legs or not’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
