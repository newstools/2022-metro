 Huge queues appear to be forming outside McDonald’s in Moscow as Russians try to get one last taste of the good stuff. Putin’s propaganda machine has relentlessly controlled the flow of information about its bloody war, but it appears word got out about the temporary shutdown at Maccies. As bombs rained down on Ukraine, hundreds of cars lined up outside a drive-thru in the capital, with the queue snaking down the road for almost ‘half a mile’. Western goods are becoming a gold-like commodity, with McDonald’s following suit after Netflix, KFC, Coca-Cola, Pizza Hut and Starbucks all stopped their Russian operations. However, pictures have emerged showing people inside a Maccies in the Russian capital today, suggesting some restaurants are still open. The fast food giant, which opened its first Russian restaurant in 1990, is due to close 850 outlets across the country. But McDonald’s said it will continue to pay its 62,000 employees, although it didn’t specify when the shutdown will end. CEO Chris Kempckinski said closing the stores is the right thing to do because McDonald’s can’t ignore the ‘needless human suffering in Ukraine’. Coffee giant Starbucks was the next to suspend all business activity in Russia, including shipment of its products and cafes run by a licensee. Coca-Cola’s statement confirming it would follow suit was quickly followed up by their rivals at Pepsi. MORE : Which companies are pulling out of Russia?
