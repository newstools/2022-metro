A woman has been spared jail after making up a story about her boss attacking her with a Biro at work. Parivash Kiani sued travel agency Aviareps, saying her line manager, Fawad Shaida, stabbed her in the hand twice with a pen at her desk in February 2015. She showed pictures of puncture wounds to her right hand and sued for mental scarring. However, a document in the background that was dated long after the alleged incident proved that she was lying. Kiani has now been given a suspended prison sentence for contempt of court and was handed an £85,000 court bill. Judge, Mr Justice Martin Spencer, said: ‘She must have deliberately in 2017 stabbed herself twice in the hand, waited for the stab wound to scab over, and then either herself – or through another person – taken these pictures of her hand in order to pretend that they were photos taken in February 2015 two years earlier, and represented the position as a result of the alleged assault.’ It emerged that Kiani had been disciplined in January 2015 for breaching client confidentiality. She was sacked in December that year and launched an unfair dismissal claim. She claimed Mr Shaida attacked her when she walked from her desk to the fax machine. She said: ‘He said something to me so I stopped, he walked towards me and was standing in front of me when he grabbed my hand and then stabbed it randomly with a pen twice.’ Kiani said she had nightmares and flashbacks, suffered chronic pain and had to use her right hand. Mr Shaida said there were some jokes in the office and he had ‘picked up her Biro and gently tapped her hand leaving an ink mark.’ The employment case was thrown out in 2017, but Kiani continued with her £3,000 compensation claim saying her bosses failed to protect her from her violent boss. Her case was thrown out in March 2020 as it ‘defied logic’. Aviareps took her to the High Court where she finally admitted contempt.
