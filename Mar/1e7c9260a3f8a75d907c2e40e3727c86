Wilko has made a screeching U-turn after telling thousands of staff they could attend work after testing positive for Covid-19. The discount retailer apologised after telling employees they could come to work if they ‘feel well’ despite testing positive. The company, which employs about 16,000 staff at more than 400 UK stores, had told workers in a new policy document: ‘If you test positive for Covid-19 and feel well you can continue to come to work, if you feel too unwell you can follow the absence policy.’ But after a backlash, chief executive Jerome Saint-Marc, said sorry and blamed ‘miscommunication’. ‘When we get something wrong, we hold our hands up, admit it and work to correct the situation,’ he said. ‘Today’s news has highlighted some miscommunication within our Covid-19 policies, and I wanted to reassure all our customers and team members. ‘Our advice to team members that have Covid symptoms or test positive is that while they’re no longer required by law to self-isolate, they should still stay at home and avoid contact with others. ‘This will help reduce the chance of spreading Covid-19.’ It comes amid some alarm among scientists about a rise in cases in the UK. Last month England dropped self-isolation laws for those who test positive – despite criticism from public health experts. The Government has also confirmed that free widescale testing is due to end from April 1. In January, Wilko also confirmed plans to shut 15 stores in a move that unions warned could impact hundreds of jobs. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
