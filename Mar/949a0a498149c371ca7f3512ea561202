A Sheikh who holds the world record for the biggest collection of 4×4 cars has now built the planet’s biggest Hummer. The 46ft (14m) long, 20ft (6m) wide and 21.6ft (6.6m) tall monster truck dwarves ordinary Hummers and looks ridiculously large in comparison. The gas-guzzling giant will run on four diesel engines and has a toilet and sink on the first of its two floors. Car-mad Sheikh Hamad Bin Hamdan Al Nahyan, from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), commissioned the vehicle for his Sharjah Off Road History Museum. The Sheikh, a billionaire member of the Emirati royal family, boasts the Guinness World Record with collection of 718 4×4 models – meaning if he drove one a day, it would take him nearly two years to use each of them. His latest ride, the so-called Hummer H1 X3, was driven to the museum on public roads, to the astonishment of locals. Built on the frame of U.S Army LARC-LX steel-hulled amphibious cargo vehicle, it is capable of a top speed of 32km/h. The museum says it is ‘three times bigger than a normal Hummer H1 by scale and 27 times by volume’. It did not reveal how the environmental cost of the Sheik’s latest toy. The interior is spread over two floors, both of which are still being worked on. The second features a majlis (a private place where house guests and friends are received and entertained) with a 360-degree view. It also contains the steering cabin. The X3 will be the latest addition to the museum in Sharjah – the UAE’s third most populated city – which is situated 30km north of Dubai. The attraction is based on the Sheikh’s love of all-terrain vehicles. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
