Mesut Ozil has been ‘suspended indefinitely’ from Fenerbahce’s squad following a bust-up with the team’s head coach Ismail Kartal. Fenerbahce currently sit third in the Turkish Super Lig, 17 points behind leaders Trabzonspor, and are battling with Konyaspor to finish second in order to secure the final Champions League qualifier place. Ozil, meanwhile, has struggled for form in recent weeks and was substituted at half time in Fenerbahce’s 2-1 win over Konyaspor on Sunday. According to reports in Turkey, Ozil had a meeting with Kartal after the game and complained about the decision to bring him off after just 45 minutes. ‘I could have stayed on the pitch longer,’ Ozil is said to have told Kartal. ‘I’m trying to contribute to this team.’ Ozil’s teammate at Fenerbahce, Ozan Tufan, is also said to have accused Kartal of being unfair with his team selection. Fenerbahce have now decided to suspend both Ozil and Turfan, with the two players not even able to train with the rest of their teammates. Ozil has scored nine goals and registered two assists for Fenerbahce so far this season. The 33-year-old joined the Turkish club in January last year after Arsenal agreed to terminate his £350,000-per-week contract. Ozil, who was signed by Arsenal from Real Madrid for £42.4 million in 2013, did not make a single appearance in his final season for the Gunners and was left out of their Premier League and Europa League squads by Mikel Arteta.
