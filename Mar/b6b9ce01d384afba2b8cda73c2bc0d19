Carlo Ancelotti says Real Madrid’s 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Barcelona was all his fault, apologising to fans for the humiliating El Clasico loss. January signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice, with Ronald Araujo and former Manchester City star Ferran Torres getting the others. It is not disastrous for Real, who remain nine points clear at the top of La Liga, and 12 points ahead of Barca in third, but it is a damaging result for Ancelotti’s reputation and future at the club. The Italian was not making excuses after the match, but tried to attract the blame to himself and away from his players. ‘The approach wasn’t good,’ he said, via Marca. ‘Barca played better and deserved to win, but the defeat does not sink us. We have to look forward and have balance, think that we have a nine-point advantage. ‘We have not been recognisable, everything has gone wrong. I have told the players that it was my fault ‘It’s hard because it’s a Clasico, because losing against Barcelona hurts. You have to be calm and calm, recover the injured. We’re sorry, but we don’t have to make a drama.’ Real Madrid now head into the international break, not playing again until they travel to Celta Vigo in La Liga on 2 April. Ancelotti is pleased to have the break to regroup, before they try and wrap up the title and challenge for the Champions League, taking on Chelsea in the quarter-finals. ‘The break is good now, because we can get players back,’ he said. ‘I don’t think it’s going to affect our mood. I’ve failed in my approach. It can happen once, twice I’m not usually wrong.’  MORE : Antonio Conte claims Arsenal have advantage over Tottenham in top-four race MORE : Arsenal legend Arsene Wenger hints at possible return to management For more stories like this, check our sport page.
