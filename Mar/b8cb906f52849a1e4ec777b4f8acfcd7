Japan has issued a tsunami warning after a powerful earthquake struck near the Fukushima power plant. The quake hit 7.3 on the richter scale and was also felt in Tokyo, Miyagi, Iwate, Tohoku and other northern regions of Japan. It also measured 6-plus on the Japanese shaking intensity scale, meaning it was too strong for people to stand. Buildings across eastern Japan, including Tokyo, shook violently, while the Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures were told to brace for a 3-foot sea surge. NHK national television said the tsunami might have reached some areas already. Around two million households are without power in the capital, according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which is checking the reactors in Fukushima. Fukushima’s power station was devastated by an enormous 9.0 quake and tsunami in 2011, in what was the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986. Any earthquake with a magnitude above 7.0 can pose a ‘serious problem’ for Japan’s nuclear power stations, the International Atomic Energy Agency warned in 2008. The Japan Meteorological Agency said today’s quake struck 60 kilometres (36 miles) below the sea. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said the government was assessing the extent of damage and promised to do its utmost for rescue and relief operations. ‘Please first take action to save your life,’ Kishida tweeted. There are no immediate reports of casualties. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
