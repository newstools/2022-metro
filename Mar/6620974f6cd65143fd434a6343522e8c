Sir Lewis Hamilton was a little starstruck sitting next to Zendaya at Paris Fashion Week and, naturally, tried to bag himself a role in her hit series Euphoria. The Formula One star landed a front row seat at the Valentino Womenswear Fall/Winter 2022/2023 show in the French capital on Sunday, and managed to nab a spot right next to the Spider-Man actress. It’s not the first time they’ve met but Sir Lewis couldn’t help but fawn over the actress’ critically acclaimed HBO series Euphoria, which he’s clearly been watching. Alongside photos of them sitting FROW at the fashion show, the sports star wrote on Instagram: ‘Thanks for having me @maisonvalentino and sitting me next to Z, asked her if I could be on season 3, those Euphoria kids need a teacher fr [for real].’ One follower agreed and commented: ‘They really do need a teacher!’ Another fan loved the idea of Sir Lewis making a Euphoria cameo and wrote: ‘How cool would that be – like really?!?!!’ ‘I wasn’t prepared for this photo 🤩 … wait… Lewis in season 3 💜,’ another commented excitedly. One fan weighed in: ‘Petition to have Lewis in season 3.’ Sir Lewis, 37, and Zendaya, 25, have been pals for a few years now and were last pictured together at the actress’ Tommy Hilfiger fashion show in March 2019. Congratulating the star on her PFW collaboration, the racing champion wrote in an Instagram post at the time: ‘Blown away by your show @zendaya, so proud of you and @thomasjhilfiger 🙏🏾. To be there and see your vision and creativity come to life in your #TommyXZendaya collection was amazing. ‘Congratulations and welcome to the family 🙌🏾 #PFW #TOMMYNOW.’ Zendaya continued to wow audiences as Euphoria aired its season two recently. The HBO series follows a group of edgy high school students as they grapple with issues of drugs, sex, and violence. The network recently confirmed the show would return for season three, and said in a statement last month: ‘Sam, Zendaya, and the entire cast and crew of Euphoria have taken season 2 to extraordinary heights, challenging narrative convention and form, while maintaining its heart. ‘We couldn’t be more honoured to work with this gifted, wildly talented team or more excited to continue our journey with them into season 3.’ As for Sir Lewis, he’s focusing on the new Formula One season, which kicks off in Bahrain on March 20.
