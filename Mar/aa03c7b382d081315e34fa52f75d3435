Tom Hiddleston is reportedly engaged to his girlfriend Zawe Ashton, after the couple played a married couple onstage. The Loki actor, 41, and the actress, 37, who co-starred in the 2019 Harold Pinter revival Betrayal where they played a married couple named Robert and Emma, are now set to walk down the aisle in real life, according to The Mirror. During the Baftas 2022 ceremony on Sunday night, the couple were reportedly congratulated by industry friends. A stunning Zawe, decked in a long flowing pink dress, reportedly concealed her diamond-encrusted ring by draping her black handbag across her hand. However, in a selfie shared by her friend AJ Ododu on her Instagram account, a ring is clearly visible. Zawe revealed she’s got no intention of working with Tom for the foreseeable future. She told The Mirror: ‘I’ve been working with Tom on stage for a year solid – every night – so now we need at least two years apart now!.’ She also revealed how she’d been living between London and LA during the pandemic. She said: ‘I’ve got into period dramas late – everyone else is over them, but I only want to do them now. They are so freeing.’ Zawe and Tom met while starring in the 2019 play Betrayal and have kept their relationship out of the spotlight ever since. The Loki actor previously told The Telegraph: ‘Everyone is entitled to a private life. ‘I love what I do and I dedicate myself with absolute commitment to making great art and great entertainment, and in my mind I don’t conflict the two. My work is in the public sphere and I have a private life. And those two things are separate.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted Tom and Zawe’s reps for comment.
