A fraudster has been barred from all Asda supermarkets across the country after he was caught scamming self-scanners. Kenneth Hollis, 43, targeted shops across Birmingham and Black Country between October and February. He put £4,001 worth of items through as carrier bags at five different locations throughout the area. Hollis, from Dudley, broke down in tears in front of magistrates when he admitted to stealing: His charge sheet said: ‘At the checkout you scanned plastic bags only and clicked finish and pay, bypassing the weighing scales. ‘You then loaded the goods into the carrier bags before paying for the carrier bags only with a debit card before leaving the store without offering payment for the goods selected.’ His sentencing was adjourned until April and he was warned he faces prison. District Judge Stephen Shaw said: ‘This is a pattern of extremely serious offending because of the high value. Certainly if it’s me (sentencing at the next hearing) I will be considering custody and of some length. ‘Working against that you have not been in trouble for 12 years. I want a report to know what’s going on and what’s led to all this.’ He added: ‘Keep out of all Asda stores. If you are stupid or foolish enough to offend on bail it will only aggravate your position.’ The case was adjourned to a date in April.
