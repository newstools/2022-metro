A man has been shot by police after an ‘armed stand-off’ at a burning house. Images posted on social media showed an individual dressed in camouflage and wearing a breathing apparatus on a residential street in Scotland. According to one witness of the Inverness incident, he appeared to be holding two knives. Independent journalist Alex Tiffin, who posted about the incident on Twitter, said: ‘A man in a respirator has set fire to his house, climbed out the window and is now facing off against Police Scotland officers with 2 knives.’ Police said a 40-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and has been taken to Raigmore Hospital. Mr Tiffin also shared images and a video of the man who appeared to charge at police officers. Police Scotland confirmed a man was shot by firearms officers after they were called to Polvanie View in Inverness around 3pm. Detectives are appealing for anyone with footage of the incident to come forward. Chief superintendent Conrad Trickett said: ‘We want to reassure the public that this incident is contained and there is no threat to the wider public. ‘There will be extra patrols in the area over the coming days and anyone with any concerns should contact police. ‘We would also ask anybody with any information or footage from the incident to get in touch.’ As is customary with any incident where a weapon is deployed by police, the circumstances of the incident have been referred to the watchdog for review. A number of residents had to be evacuated while Scottish Fire and Rescue Service extinguished the fire but no one was hurt in the blaze.
