Joker the cat is sweet, playful… and a little stress-y. Who can relate? The five-year-old feline is on the lookout for a place where he can settle in without the overwhelm triggered by other cats or dogs. But so far, after 271 days at Llys Nini shelter, Joker is no closer to finding his dream home. He’s part of the fab four – a group of cats who are the longest staying residents at the RSPCA centre (the others are Gizmo, Misty, and Llew). Unlike Misty and Llew, Joker isn’t an old bloke – he’s a sprightly five years and 11 months old. So why hasn’t anyone showed interest in making him part of the family? ‘Joker is a sweet-natured cat who is loved by the staff,’ say the team at Llys Nini. ‘He had had quite a journey with us and we are happy he is now finally able to find his new home. ‘He enjoys attention and playing with his toys, he will make a loving new addition to the family. ‘Joker does need a home which isn’t going to stress him out so we believe a home with no cats or dogs will be best for him and children 10 years+.’ Joker does need medication – he had a large dental procedure and will likely need to be on steroids for life. He also has to have special food for sensitive tummies. But let’s be real – a daily pill and some special food pouches are a small price to pay for an adorable friend. The cat has been in the shelter for nearly a year now, and while the centre’s staff love playing with him, we think it’s high time Joker found his forever home.
