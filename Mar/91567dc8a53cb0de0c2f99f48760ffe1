Louis van Gaal has insisted ‘the manager decides the tactics’ after Virgil van Dijk questioned the system the Netherlands boss plays. Van Dijk was deployed as one of the centre-backs in a back three formation for the Netherlands’ 4-2 win over Denmark on Saturday. The Liverpool defender typically lines up in a 4-3-3 system under Jurgen Klopp at Anfield, and clearly stated his preference. ‘Until today we have been training hard, with lots of tactics and meetings. There are good times but also things to improve. We will analyse this,’ Van Dijk said. ‘Of course, we are playing in a new system, different things are required of the players. But I think we showed a lot of good things. ‘Do I like the system? Well, I’m still in favour of 4-3-3 but I’m not the national coach and the national coach has a very strong opinion about it.’ In response, Van Gaal said: ‘I know he has that preference, he always said this publicly. ‘We already had this debate when I came here. ‘The manager decides the tactics.’ Van Gaal came out of retirement last year to take over as Netherlands boss, following the departure of Ronald De Boer. The former Manchester United manager has ensured his side’s qualification to the 2022 World Cup during his time in charge.
