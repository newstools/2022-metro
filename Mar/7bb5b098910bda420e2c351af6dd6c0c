Victoria Beckham has marked her eldest child Brooklyn’s 23rd birthday with a touching tribute and adorable throwback snap. The former Spice Girl took to Instagram to post a sweet previously unseen snap of her son as a baby to the delight of her millions of followers. In the image, Victoria is under a palm tree on a tropical beach with the ocean in the background as baby Brooklyn is seated on her lap nibbling on a banana. The 47-year-old, who was rocking her famous dark pixie cut at the time and wore a black bikini, captioned the post: ’23 years ago today my life changed forever, I felt a love impossible to explain. ‘Brooklyn, you have no idea how much we all love you. Happy Birthday to the sweetest, kindest soul.’ Fans were quick to take to the comments to share their birthday wishes and gush over the adorable snap. Victoria’s fellow Spice Girl Melanie C also wished Brooklyn a happy birthday with three red heart emojis. Victoria shares Brooklyn with husband David Beckham, 46, and the former England footballer soon followed suit by posting a holiday snap of himself with bleach blond hair holding his Brooklyn as a baby wearing a nappy and round sunglasses. He wrote: ‘Happy Birthday to my amazing boy. Happy Birthday, bust, we love u so much. ‘Have the most amazing day @brooklynbeckham @victoriabeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham #HarperSeven.’ The couple is also parents to sons Romeo, 19, and Cruz, 17, and daughter Harper, 10. Sharing a recent picture of his brothers in an Instagram post, Romeo, who recently joined his mum, Victoria, for Paris Fashion Week, added: ‘Happy birthday bro love u so much @brooklynbeckham.’ Brooklyn has been keeping himself busy planning his wedding to American model and actress Nicola Peltz. He was last seen cooking Nicola a romantic Valentine’s Day meal in a video for Vogue’s YouTube channel, where the pair discussed their upcoming nuptials. In the video it was revealed that Brooklyn, who popped the question in July 2020, just a few months after he and Nicola began dating, only really has one wedding request, albeit a bizzare one. ‘That’s the only thing you said in our wedding meetings. “Don’t do square plates!”‘ revealed 27-year-old Nicola. The pair will reportedly get married surrounded by close family and friends on April 9. Got a story?
