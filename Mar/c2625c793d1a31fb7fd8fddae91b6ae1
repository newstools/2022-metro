Brendan Rodgers believes Aaron Ramsdale is currently England’s best goalkeeper following his impressive save in Arsenal’s 2-0 victory over Leicester City on Sunday. Thomas Partey gave the Gunners an early lead at the Emirates Stadium and Ramsdale was able to keep his side’s clean sheet intact with a brilliant, acrobatic save to deny Harvey Barnes’ header. After Ramsdale’s save, Rodgers turned to the dugout and television cameras caught the Leicester City manager saying ‘wow’. And after the match, Rodgers praised Ramsdale for his performances since moving to Arsenal last summer. ‘For me he’s the best English keeper at the moment. I think he’s top,’ said Rodgers. ‘His progression since he came to Arsenal, he’s playing for a huge club, different expectation with how to play football, I think he’s dealt with that really well. ‘It looks like he’s come into the club here, he’s playing now with a calmness. We saw him earlier this season and he was jumping about, but now he’s got a really nice calmness to his game. He plays well with his feet, he makes saves, his save from Barnes looked in all the way, that was a great save and it kept Arsenal in front.’ When asked about Ramsdale’s save, Mikel Arteta said: ‘He made a great save with Harvey Barnes’ header in a crucial moment when we were 1-0 up. ‘That’s when you need your goalkeeper to come out and get you out of trouble, and he certainly did it today.’ Alexandre Lacazette’s penalty in the 59th minute completed Arsenal’s 2-0 win to strengthen their push to finish in the top four. The Gunners sit a point ahead of fifth-placed Manchester United but they have three games in hand over Ralf Rangnick’s side. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
