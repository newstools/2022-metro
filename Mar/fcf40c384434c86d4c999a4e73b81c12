Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete as neutrals at the upcoming Winter Paralympics in Beijing, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has confirmed. The athletes will compete under the Paralympic flag and will not be included in the medal table. In the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the International Olympic Committee has recommended that sports federations should exclude Russian and Belarusian athletes, teams and officials from competitions ‘wherever possible’. FIFA and UEFA has already announced this week that Russian teams are now excluded from their competitions, including the World Cup and the Europa League.

The IPC’s decision is likely to be met with huge criticism following calls from several nations for Russian and Belarusian athletes to be banned from competing at the Winter Paralympics. The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee said in a statement: ‘As the world watches in horror while Russia brazenly attacks the innocent people and athletes of Ukraine, this is the only acceptable action to be taken until peace is restored.’ Following the IPC’s ruling, Nadine Dorries, Britain’s secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, said in a statement: ‘I am extremely disappointed in the IPC – this is the wrong decision and I call on them to urgently reconsider. ‘They must join the rest of the world in condemning this barbaric invasion by banning Russian and Belarusian athletes from competing.’ The Winter Paralympics begins on Friday and ends on March 13.
