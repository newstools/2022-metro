A judge told a man ‘it would almost be funny if it wasn’t so serious’ as he jailed him for stabbing his girlfriend in a row over pizza. Nathaniel Williams, 29, got into an argument with his girlfriend about where to buy their food. He wanted Pizza Hut but she wanted Pizza Choice. At some point she went into the kitchen to get a drink and when her back was turned she felt a ‘small prick’ on her backside. She felt blood on her hand and when she turned around Williams became hysterical, repeatedly saying sorry at their home in Cardiff. He convinced her not to go to hospital as police would become involved. However one of his victim’s friends came round later and after seeing what had happened took her to hospital. He was later arrested and told to stay away from her. However, on December 4 the victim woke up in the middle of the night and he was standing at the foot of her bed. He refused to leave her house so she went to her parents’ and he followed her. After being arrested, he managed to break free from the handcuffs and attacked PC Ceri Barnes. Recorder John Philpotts said: ‘If it wasn’t so serious, it would almost be funny that you were arguing over where to buy a pizza, but that led to that young woman being stabbed. ‘You inflicted upon her a nasty wound with a knife and knives are always serious, potentially deadly weapons.’ Williams was jailed for a year and must not contact his victim for five years.
