Tottenham defender Cristian Romero has been criticised for taunting Harry Maguire after the defender’s own goal this evening. Manchester United recorded a 3-2 win over Tottenham at Old Trafford courtesy of Cristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick but were made to work for the three points. Spurs twice levelled the scores through Harry Kane and a Maguire own goal but Romero’s reaction to the latter has caused quite the stir on social media. Romero was seen laughing in the England international’s face as he sat slumped on the floor after his outstretched leg diverted the ball beyond David de Gea. But his actions didn’t sit well with pundits Roy Keane and Michael Dawson in the Sky Sports studio. ‘Not good, no,’ Keane responded when asked about the incident. ‘Not good, getting all up for that. ‘You remember. When you’re a player, you take note of that, don’t worry.’ Former Spurs defender Dawson added: ‘It comes back to haunt you. ‘Certainly as a defender, you make mistakes, things like that don’t go right. It could be you next week.’ Maguire has endured a difficult few months for below par performances with Keane one of his biggest critics. But the Irishman was on Maguire’s side this time and laid no blame at his feet for his attempts to keep out the cross. ‘You can’t be too critical of Maguire,’ Keane said. ‘I’ve been critical of him, but he’s doing his best. ‘It’s an honest mistake and these things happen in football.’ MORE : ‘They are not very good!’ – Gary Neville’s bleak assessment of Manchester United’s performance despite Tottenham win MORE : Roy Keane claims Man Utd star Cristiano Ronaldo was ‘angry and upset’ in Tottenham win For more stories like this, check our sport page.
