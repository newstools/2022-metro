Rebel Wilson has flashed her middle finger to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the Bafta 2022 awards ceremony, sparking quite a stir on social media. While taking to the stage to introduce Emilia Jones’ musical performance, Rebel explained that there were two sign language interpreters on stage. ‘And this is the gesture for Putin,’ she quipped while raising her middle finger – to applause from the audience. Many social media users were quick to react to the moment, with many commenting on the fact the BBC blurred out her hand. One quipped: ‘We know which finger Rebel Wilson raised to Putin. ‘You didn’t have to hide it Bafta.’ ‘#BAFTAs go Rebel Wilson on the Putin hand gesture  (why did they blur it out?),’ another questioned. A third said: ‘@RebelWilson While describing the sign languages American versus British during the BAFTA’S, Rebel said thankfully the sign language for Putin is Universal and she held up the middle finger [sic].’ The chair of Bafta Krishnendu Majumdar opened the ceremony with a statement regards the ongoing situation. In the statement, Krishnendu said: ‘Together with our colleagues at the Ukrainian Film Academy, we stand in solidarity and hope for a return to peace.’ ‘We’re hugely grateful to the journalists covering Ukraine, many of whom are BAFTA members. ‘Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine as well as those affected by other conflicts around the world.’ MORE : Millie Bobby Brown and boyfriend Jake Bongiovi look super-glam as they make red carpet debut at Baftas MORE : Bafta 2022: Rebel Wilson slays on red carpet before joking about weight loss transformation in epic opening speech
