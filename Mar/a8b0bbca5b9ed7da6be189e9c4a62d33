Manchester United are interested in signing Bayern Munich star Robert Lewandowski and are preparing a ‘first offer’ for the Poland superstar. The 33-year-old has another 18 months to run on his contract with the Bundesliga giants and he’s yet to receive a proposal to extend his contract at the Allianz Arena. Lewandowski showed he’s lost none of his prowess in front of goal on Tuesday night when he scored an 11-minute hat-trick against RB Salzburg in the Champions League. United want to sign a new striker this summer and had planned on signing a younger back-up to Cristiano Ronaldo. But Bild say United have intimated they will be ready to submit an offer for Lewandowski if he shows his intention to leave Bayern, which could be this summer. Given his age and contract situation, Bayern’s last opportunity to raise a good sum for Lewandowski is this summer if he refuses to sign a new deal. That could open the door to United, with Lewandowski known to be keen on playing in England. Chelsea were interested in signing Lewandowski last summer but the Pole opted to stay in Germany. Edinson Cavani, Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata are all set to leave the club on free transfers at the end of the season, while Donny van de Beek, Anthony Martial, Dean Henderson and Phil Jones could also vacate. Much could depend on whether United manage to qualify for the Champions League, with the Red Devils outsiders to finish in the top four. Winning the competition this term is another route back into the Champions League but United’s last-16 tie against Atletico Madrid is in the balance, with the aggregate score at 1-1 after the first leg.
