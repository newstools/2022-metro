Fourteen border collie puppies have been stolen from a farm, along with the mother of nine of them. The dogs were taken from Parsonage Farm in Hampshire, where employees returned from lambing to find them missing yesterday morning. People have been warned to be careful if they see any border collie puppies advertised for sale at a cut price. A group of seven people were allegedly seen walking around the farm yard in Bramshaw at around 1.40am after breaking into a number of farm buildings in search of farm machinery, Hampshire Police said in a statement. They then stole the dogs before fleeing the scene. In a statement, police said: ‘We appreciate that these events will have a significant impact on the local rural community and we are asking anyone who may have seen anything suspicious or perhaps caught any people or vehicles in the vicinity on CCTV to come forward. ‘It is likely that these puppies will be sold via online websites and platforms, so we are asking residents to be aware in case they see a litter of Border Collie puppies being advertised locally at a cut-down price.’ Police initially said that twelve puppies and a breeding dog had been stolen, but revised this to say that 14 were taken, nine from one litter and five from another.
