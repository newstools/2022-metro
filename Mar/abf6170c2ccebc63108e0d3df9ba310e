A cargo ship has been sunk off the coast of Odessa, close to where there were reports of Russian naval activity earlier today. The Estonian-owned cargo ship Helt was damaged on Thursday off Ukraine’s south coast, the vessel’s manager said. Four sailors are feared dead and two others were trapped at sea in a life raft. Igor Ilves, managing director of Tallinn-based manager Vista Shipping Agency, confirmed the incident to Reuters.

Two of the crew are in a raft on the water and four others are missing. ‘I don’t know where they are at the moment.’ Mr Ilves said the vessel might have struck a mine. The area off Ukraine’s south coast has been the scene of heightened naval activity in recent days. Unverified footage circulated on social media today showed several ships in the Black Sea. Russia maintains a naval presence off the Crimean peninsula and it’s feared the fleet will be used to attack the port city of Odessa. Several ships have been caught up in the ongoing conflict, which has an active theatre off the south coast of Ukraine. A Moldovan-flagged chemical tanker was hit by a missile in a similar location last week. Two people were injured by the blast, and it is still unclear who fired at the Millennial Spirit. Previous media reports suggested the vessel was Romanian – leading to fears that Russia had attacked a NATO member. But this has since turned out to be false, as Moldova’s naval agency confirmed the ship was from its country – which is not part of the defensive alliance.
