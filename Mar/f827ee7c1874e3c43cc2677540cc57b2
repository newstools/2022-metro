A lorry driver had to be saved from drowning after his vehicle plunged into a river in southwest London. Video footage shows the truck sinking into the water in Twickenham, forcing fighters and a lifeboat crew members to act. One witness told MyLondon that the driver had ‘misjudged’ the edge of the road after a nearby carpark was flooded by high tide. Several other cars parked on the aptly named Water Lane had been partially submerged. As the skip lorry began to sink, onlookers called for help. The driver was stuck for more than 30 minutes as high tides continued to climb the vehicle. Once on the scene, volunteers from the RNLI drew up in lifeboats right next to the cab window. They took to the window with a hammer and were able to reach the driver after smashing through the glass. Video captured the moment the lorry bobbed in the water as swans and geese swam past. Thomas Vye, who captured the footage, said that the driver would have been ‘shaken up’ following the ordeal. He added that he couldn’t tell if the loud nearby geese were ‘laughing or just being astonished.’ He had been at the waterfront to film a pochard, a medium-sized diving duck. The driver miraculously, had no injuries following the incident. The London Fire Brigade successfully winched his vehicle safely out of the water. Borough commander John Snelgrove said: ‘The tide was at its highest point and the water was up to the driver’s side window and prevented him from leaving the vehicle. ‘Firefighters secured the skip lorry to stop it from moving further into the water. Thankfully the local RNLI crews arrived and using a hammer from the fire engine broke the passenger’s side window and helped the man into the boat. ‘Thankfully the man was uninjured. This usual incident shows the breath of work fire crews deal with and good partnership working with key partner agencies.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
