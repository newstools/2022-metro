Laura Kuenssberg is launching her own Sunday morning show, the outgoing BBC politics editor has announced. The BBC spent three months looking for Andrew Marr’s successor after he left his primetime weekend slot to start a new LBC radio show. Newsreader Sophie Raworth has temporarily filled in, but the national broadcaster was believed to be looking for a long-term figure to get politicians quaking in their boots. Ms Kuenssberg was hotly tipped for the gig after she too announced she would be stepping down as politics editor in December after seven years. Confirming her new job on Twitter, Ms Kuenssberg wrote: ‘I’m extremely happy to say that I’ll be in the BBC politics chair on Sunday mornings from September. ‘It’s a genuine honour and real thrill to be working with an amazing team on the show, can’t wait to get started!’ The star journalist has been at the helm of BBC’s political coverage during some of the most turbulent years in recent memory.  She started within months of David Cameron confirming there would be an EU referendum in 2015. You may have noticed but things have got quite bumpy ever since, from Brexit actually happening and Donald Trump becoming US President, to Boris Johnson entering Downing Street and the coronavirus pandemic. From September, Ms Kuenssberg will begin grilling ministers and politicians on the biggest talking points of the day. Interim director of BBC News, Jonathan Munro, said she is the ‘perfect host’ for their flagship weekend politics show. ‘She’s an engaging presenter and a razor-sharp political interviewer, and she knows exactly which questions audiences want answered,’ he added. BBC chief content officer Charlotte Moore said: ‘Laura’s one of the BBC’s biggest talents and I’m delighted she’s becoming the new face of Sunday mornings. ‘I’m very much looking forward to seeing how she makes the show her own.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
