There were wild scenes at a Hollywood bar as a man challenged Mike Tyson to a fight before pulling a gun on him, but the former heavyweight champion’s feathers were barely ruffled and he ended up hugging the aggressor. The incident occurred on Tuesday, with the unidentified man interrupting a comedy gig at the bar to challenge Iron Mike to a fight, who was sat in the front row. He was shut down, with the MC trying to remove the man and it seemed to be de-escalating, as he said: ‘I don’t give a f***! I’m joking.’ The video of the incident, obtained by TMZ, then shows the dramatic moment he steps back and pulls a gun from his waistband and cocks it. There are gasps from the crowd, but the man quickly seems to change his mind and returns the weapon to his waistband, before saying to Tyson: ‘Hey I love you fam, salute to all of your accomplishments, for real, if it wasn’t for you we wouldn’t have no inspiration, I love you OG, for real. From the heart, for real. Respect.’ Tyson has barely moved a muscle by this point, sitting calmly in his chair, but he then called the man over and hugged it out with him. The man shouts, ‘New York! Brownsville!’ and shakes Tyson’s hand before having another spat with the MC and eventually leaving, much to the rest of the attendees’ relief.
