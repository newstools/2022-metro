Dog poo left on a rugby pitch in Wales has left a man with life-changing injuries. Darryl Adams, 50, was rushed to hospital in 2005 after he was stamped on with rugby boot studs covered in faeces. The studs of the boot had pierced through the skin of Darryl’s shin, transferring dangerous bacteria. His leg has ‘never been right since’ and Darrly is now urging dog owners to pick up after their pets. He told the Liverpool Echo: ‘I ended up having a week in hospital and the doctor who treated me said that once you get cellulitis. ‘All it takes is something small to trigger it off again. ‘The infection flared up twice between 2005 and 2013. The last flare up in 2013 was the worst. ‘All it took was heavy flu to trigger it and I was hospitalised for two weeks because the infection had tracked into my veins. ‘Ever since then my leg has never been right, it is constantly swollen and looks awful. ‘All from some selfish person who couldn’t be bothered to pick up after their dog.’ Dog faeces carry deadly bacteria that can cause serious health problems in situation’s such as Darryl’s. The bacteria can lead to infection, asthma or even blindness. People have been urged to take due care to pick up their pet’s mess, especially as bacteria can live on in the soil. Lesley Jones, chief executive of Keep Wales Tidy, said: ‘We urge the minority of irresponsible dog owners to do the right thing and pick up after their pets. ‘By not picking up after your dog, you could be putting people at risk. Darryl’s story highlights just how harmful dog poo can be for people. ‘Dog poo isn’t just an unpleasant mess, it can be dangerous. Please bag it, bin it and leave only paw prints when you’re out and about.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
