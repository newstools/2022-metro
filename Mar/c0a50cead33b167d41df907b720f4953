Antonio Conte says Chelsea’s situation is ‘a pity’ after Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the British Government. On Thursday, the Government announced that Abramovich was included in its latest list of sanctions, calling Chelsea’s owner a ‘pro-Kremlin oligarch’ and claimed that the 55-year-old has ‘had a close relationship for decades’ with Russia’s president Vladimir Putin. Abramovich’s assets in the UK have now been frozen, while Chelsea have been issued with a ‘general licence’ which restricts the club’s operations and prevents them from selling tickets to fans, signing new players or agreeing new contracts for existing members of the squad. Conte, meanwhile, spent two seasons at Chelsea and helped the club win the Premier League and FA Cup during his time at Stamford Bridge. When asked about Chelsea’s situation after Abramovich’s sanction, Conte said: ‘Honestly, I have just listened to this situation. ‘This morning we had a training session. Is not easy, is not easy. ‘Honestly, it’s a pity, also because I was coach in this club, in Chelsea, I enjoyed two seasons. ‘Also, I won two titles, I worked in this club. It’s a pity to listen to this situation, it’s not simple for the players, it’s not simple for Thomas Tuchel, for the fans, for the whole environment, the Chelsea environment. ‘Honestly, I hope that in general, that this situation between Russia and Ukraine is going to finish, and to find a peace, because it’s too much important. ‘And then, other situations that are coming from this conflict. I think that it’s not right. I for hope the best, for this club, because I worked in this club, I enjoyed the two seasons. ‘For sure, I love the team, the club that I worked in in the past. Every team that worked in the past. I hope for the best for them.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
