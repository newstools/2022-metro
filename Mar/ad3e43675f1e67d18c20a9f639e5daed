Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will deliver a virtual address to members of Congress on Wednesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced in a joint letter Monday. ‘As war rages on in Ukraine, it is with great respect and admiration for the Ukrainian people that we invite all Members of the House and Senate to attend a Virtual Address to the United States Congress delivered by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine on Wednesday, March 16th at 9.00am,’ they wrote. The speech comes after Congress passed a $1.5 trillion budget bill to fund the government that included $13.6 billion in assistance to Ukraine following Russia’s unprovoked attack on its neighbor. For weeks Zelensky has pleaded with the US and NATO allies to establish a no-fly zone over Ukraine, something Western leaders have resisted over fears of sparking broader conflict in Europe. ‘The Congress remains unwavering in our commitment to supporting Ukraine as they face Putin’s cruel and diabolical aggression, and to passing legislation to cripple and isolate the Russian economy as well as deliver humanitarian, security and economic assistance to Ukraine,’ Pelosi and Schumer said. Earlier this month, about 300 members of both the House and Senate attended a Zoom call with Zelensky, during which he pleaded with lawmakers to provide  Ukraine with more fighter jets and military aid.
