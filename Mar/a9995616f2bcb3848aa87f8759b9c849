A beautiful Somerset home has hit the market for £725,000. Built in 1800, the property has some very lush original features, including the huge double doors, chic wooden pillars and tall stained-glass windows. It’s spacious and bright, and the garden is sizeable and lined with trees. The catch? That garden is a graveyard, which means your immediate neighbours will be long-buried corpses. That’s right, part of the reason why the property is so stunning is because it’s a converted church. It sadly fell into disrepair over the years but has since been transformed into a lovely family home. Renovated in the mid 80s by architect Warwick Rodwell, who specialised in churches and chapels, the building was transformed into a bright and airy family home and renamed Downside Old Church. Some of the headstones are over 200 years old, so it’s unlikely you’d have to worry about surprise visitors. If they wanted to swing by, any visitors would have to submit a written request to the owner of the property. On the market with estate agency Cooper and Tanner, branch manager Samuel Masters said: ‘The main draw to the house is how big it really is inside. The garden is a compromise to some, but the other features make it a great home. ‘The strong colours inside and the way it has been well decorated eradicates any cold spookiness of a church and gives a warm and cosy feeling to the home. ‘The garden wouldn’t suit everyone, but the house itself has a lot of quirky characteristics. ‘So many memories will have happened in this church – weddings, baptisms and also funerals. The home has retained its magnificent history whilst being liveable.’ Do you have a story to share?
