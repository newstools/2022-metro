Jet2 has become the first major airline to drop the requirement for face coverings onboard some flights. Holidaymakers flying from England and Northern Ireland will now be able to travel maskless. The airline made the announcement this week following the change to the UK Government’s coronavirus guidance. While masks are no longer a necessity on board, passengers have been urged to pack one in hand luggage for when they disembark. Countries such as Spain still have strict mask regulations in place. A Jet 2 spokesperson said: ‘It is no longer a legal requirement to wear a face mask in England and Northern Ireland, including at our airports or onboard our aircraft. ‘However, as per UK Government guidance, we recommend that customers continue to wear a face mask in these spaces, and we remind customers that they will need to wear one when they get to their overseas destination.’ North of the border, adults and children aged six and over must still wear a face mask on flights in line with Scottish Government regulations still in place. Meanwhile, the Evening Standard reports Ryanair might be making a similar change in travel requirements soon. Michael O’Leary said he hoped to see the end of masks on planes by the ‘end of April or May’. Masks on planes have been a point of contention throughout the pandemic. Last summer a woman was physically dragged off a Ryanair plane after she ‘refused to wear a face mask’. The woman even spat and pulled the hair of fellow passengers.
