Jada Pinkett Smith has given Rihanna’s eye-catching pregnancy outfits her seal of approval. The We Found Love singer announced she was expecting her first child with boyfriend A$AP Rocky in February, and it’s been a wardrobe whirlwind ever since with Rihanna blessing us with striking looks nearly on a daily basis. In arguably her most daring maternity outfit to date, Rihanna, 34, sported see-through lingerie to Dior’s Paris Fashion Week show putting her bare baby bump on full display. It has stirred fond memories of Jada’s own pregnancy days as she shared a throwback photo of herself donning a sheer dress at the Grammys in 1998 when she was expecting son Jaden Smith. Supporting Rihanna, she wrote in the Instagram caption: ‘Who says you can’t wear see thru fits when you’re preggers???😍😜😍 ‘I love me some Rih. She’s bold, unapologetic, fierce, kind and an all around girls girl. She likes to see other women win and that’s one of her qualities I admire most. She’s a queen that loves helping other women find and hold their own crowns.’ The 50-year-old actress added: ‘As women, it’s important that we seeeee one another, help heal one another, love one another and support one another. Here’s to one more of my favorites for International Women’s Month.’ Rihanna’s latest iconic outfits at fashion week come after the star was seen in a range of legendary fits to complement her bump, either going about her business in New York in a lacy black top or attending the Super Bowl in a stunning sheer blouse. The mum-to-be often shows off her bump in partially-unzipped coats, last month wearing a savage leopard print jacket against the cold in New York as she hit the Louis Vuitton store in the Big Apple. However, while she makes it look as easy as breathing, the singer and businesswoman admitted in a recent interview that dressing while pregnant can be ‘challenging’. ‘I’m enjoying not having to worry about covering up my tummy,’ she told People magazine in February. ‘If I feel a little chubby, it’s like, whatever! It’s a baby!’ She noted that while playing with clothes as a pregnant gal is tricky, it’s also ‘fun.’ ‘Right now, being pregnant, some days you just feel like, “Ugh, I just want to lay here on this couch all day,”‘ she admitted. ‘But when you put on a little face and a little lipstick, you transform.’ Got a story?
