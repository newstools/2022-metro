Pictures show the ruins of a £150,000 Lamborghini Huracan after a man crashed it into the side of an office building. The pricey sports car was left ‘completely smashed up’ after the driver allegedly ‘lost control’ in Shoreditch, east London. Witnesses claimed they heard him ‘rev his engine’ while coming out of a car wash across the road from the office this afternoon. Two people were taken to hospital after it slammed into the Fora Shoreditch building just off Great Eastern Street, according to one onlooker. Speaking to MyLondon, an unnamed woman said: ‘I only heard it, but the guy was revving his engine then there was a loud bang. ‘It sounded a bit like the car backfired, but it’s clearly where he lost control and ditched it into the doors.’ Another witness said: ‘He was coming out of the car wash and hit the building. ‘The man and lady [in the car] are ok. They left but are both in hospital.’ A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said they were not called to the scene. The London Ambulance Service and Fora Shoreditch have been approached for comment. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
