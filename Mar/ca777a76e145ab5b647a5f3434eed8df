Gogglebox star Sophie Sandiford couldn’t hold back her tears as she imagined what it would be like if her brother Pete Sandiford went to war as they watched terrifying footage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In the days since Vladimir Putin first launched his attack, more than one million people have been evacuated from the country. Ukraine has a conscription in place under the order of President Volodymyr Zelensky, with men between the ages of 18 to 60 banned from leaving the country as reserves and civilians are called on to fight.

Pete, who has been on the Channel 4 programme with his sister since 2017, admitted that he didn’t know how he would feel if he were made to fight in a war. ‘I don’t know how I’d feel if I got held back, to fight the war. Because what do you do? You can’t go, “No, I’m going,” but by the same token, do I really want to be getting shot at and potentially killed? What’s more valuable to me?’ he said. Sophie began tearing up, as she responded: ‘I’m choking up even thinking about that. ‘Cause I would just stay with you.’ Pete insisted that he wouldn’t let Sophie stay behind in his attempts to console her. ‘No you wouldn’t. F**king wouldn’t let you, you little soft a**e. Stop it you k***head, you’re going to make me cry. We’re here, you f**king idiot!’ he told her. ‘I know, but it’s just scary,’ she replied as she wiped away her tears. Several Gogglebox viewers shared on Twitter that Pete and Sophie’s conversation also left them crying, as one wrote: ‘Cheers Sophie and Pete I’m now a blubbering mess!’ ‘Sophie & Pete choked me up, it’s true you can’t help but put yourselves in their shoes,’ someone else commented. ‘Pete and Sophie just broke my heart,’ another remarked, while one viewer added: ‘Pete and Sophie have me sobbing. That sibling bond they have is so strong.’ Today, it was reported that there are fears that 100 people may be trapped under rubble after a residential area near Kyiv was shelled yesterday. The BBC has announced that it is ‘temporarily suspending’ all BBC News operations in Russia, after authorities passed legislation which the broadcaster’s director-general Tim Davie said appeared to ‘criminalise the process of independent journalism’.
