Anthony Joshua has again denied sleeping with the wife of fellow boxer Amir Khan. Khan accused his wife Faryal Makhdoom of ‘moving on’ with Joshua in 2017 during a furious row between the couple on social media. Joshua denied the accusation – famously responding by sharing a video of Shaggy’s 2000 hit ‘It Wasn’t Me’ – with Khan later explaining there was ‘no truth to it’ with the incident seemingly put to bed. Tweets from Joshua’s official account emerged on Saturday night however with the former heavyweight champion in attendance at UFC London at the O2 Arena. One fan replied to Joshua asking: ‘AJ lad did you f**k Mrs Khan back in the day?’ Joshua’s account replied: ‘Honestly I didn’t. With all the accusations around me name I wish I did.’ Joshua was expected to meet Oleksandr Usyk in a rematch in May or June after the Ukrainian came to London last September and took the IBF, WBO and WBA heavyweight titles. However, following the invasion of his homeland earlier this month, Usyk has returned to Ukraine where he has since joined the territorial defence battalion. With Usyk’s immediate boxing future uncertain, the possibility of an ‘interim’ fight has been discussed for Joshua. Fellow Olympian Joe Joyce and Otto Wallin, a former opponent of Tyson Fury, are some of the names in the frame to meet the 31-year-old in the coming months.
