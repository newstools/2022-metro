A woman charged with stalking David Beckham has been accused of turning up at his daughter Harper’s school pretending to be another pupil’s mum. Sharon Bell, 58, is accused of harassing the former footballer, 46, and repeatedly trying to contact him. She also allegedly turned up at the Beckhams’ home in West London. In December, Bell, who allegedly contacted the Beckhams as far back at 2016, was handed an interim stalking order and was banned from approaching or contacting Beckham, his wife Victoria, or any of their children. She was also banned from being within 500 metres of the house, their Cotswolds mansion, and Harper’s school. The Met Police reportedly charged Bell with ‘acts associated with stalking’. She is also said to have sent a letter to Beckham in October. The charge reportedly reads: ‘You attended this address. ‘On October 6, 2021, he received a letter from you at his London address, and on November 18, 2021 you attended Mr Beckham’s daughter’s school address and attempted to see her.’ Bell has not yet entered a plea and is due to appear at Westminster magistrates court on March 28. The Beckhams, who have been married since 1999, share four children – Brooklyn, 23, Romeo, 19, Cruz, 17, and Harper, 10. Brooklyn recently celebrated his birthday, with his parents sharing sweet messages. Metro.co.uk has contacted the Met Police for comment. Got a story?
