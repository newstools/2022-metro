The mother of murdered 16-month-old Star Hobson has had her prison sentence increased from eight to 12 years at the Court of Appeal. Frankie Smith, 20, was jailed in December for her role in the toddler’s death at the hands of her ‘evil’ partner Savannah Brockhill. Star died in hospital in September 2020 having suffered ‘utterly catastrophic’ and ‘unsurvivable’ injuries. Brockhill, 28, a bouncer and security guard, was found guilty of Star’s murder, while Smith was found guilty of causing or allowing her death. During the trial, jurors heard Smith’s family and friends had growing fears about bruising on the little girl in the months before she died, and made a series of complaints to social services. But Brockhill and Smith managed to convince social workers that the marks were accidental and the complaints were maliciously made by people who didn’t like their relationship. Prosecutors said Star’s fatal injuries involved extensive damage to her abdominal cavity ‘caused by a severe and forceful blow or blows, either in the form of punching, stamping or kicking to the abdomen’. Sentencing Brockhill and Smith, judge Mrs Justice Lambert said the toddler’s ‘short life was marked by neglect, cruelty and injury’. Star was found to have suffered two brain injuries, numerous ribs fractures, the fracture and refracture of her leg, and a skull fracture when she died. Attorney General Suella Braverman announced in January she would be referring Smith’s sentence to the Court of Appeal, describing the case as ‘tragic and extremely upsetting’ and saying she believes Smith’s eight-year term was ‘unduly lenient’. However, she could not recommend any increase to Brockhill’s sentence after she was handed a life term with a minimum of 25 years in prison.
