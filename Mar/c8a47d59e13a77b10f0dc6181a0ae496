Dozens of cats have been rescued from a property where they were locked into rooms with no food or water. Lisa James, from Middlesbrough, has run Cat and Kitten Rescue for the last 12 years. She received a message about 33 animals that needed to be saved and paid a visit to the home in question. Lisa, 38, says larger charities had been contacted, but after a brief call, they said they weren’t able to help. When she got to the house, she found ‘thin, scared and starving’ cats and kittens had been left in ‘appalling conditions’. The animals had been locked inside rooms that had the windows taped shut with no food, bedding or toys. ‘I went out to a property to assess a situation which sounded very desperate. I hoped it wasn’t as bad as the Facebook message made out, but I was in for a shock,’ Lisa told Teesside Live. Every room was a ‘horrifying picture’ – with eight kittens kept in a toilet room which had no window. These ones were left with water, but their litter trays were overflowing with excrement, Lisa said. The cats’ owner had been a backyard breeder and had managed to sell some of the animals. However, when they got to 10-weeks-old, she struggled to find homes for them and resorted to locking them into different rooms. ‘Within five hours I had removed 33 cats and kittens from the appalling conditions they had been left to live in,’ Lisa said. ‘I did not know where I would house them at all. I didn’t know how I would fund their care. But they absolutely could not stay there.’ The mum-of-four took the animals to her home whilst she started her desperate search for a veterinary practice which will give them a health check, neutering and vaccinations. She has launched a GoFundMe page to help raise money for the treatment. Lisa started the Cat and Kitten Rescue after the death of her own cat 12 years ago.
