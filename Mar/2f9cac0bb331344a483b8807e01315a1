An NHS worker has vowed not to quit her job despite winning £1 million on the lottery. Marion Wood, 60, had a cuppa in ‘stunned silence’ with her friend Michael Williams, 67, when they realised their numbers had come through. ‘I didn’t tell a soul at first, I just carried on as normal holding on to the lucky ticket wherever I went,’ she said. ‘I kept the ticket in my diary, which I keep in my purse, until the lady from Camelot visited to check it and confirmed that Michael and I actually were big winners.’ Ms Wood admitted it’s been ‘tough’ working through the pandemic at Northampton General Hospital. She said: ‘The amount of work has increased and, unfortunately, I have lost many family and friends. ‘However, work has kept me going, I love my job and I won’t be leaving even after this amazing win.’ While she has no plans on leaving her day job, Ms Wood said she may treat herself to some jewellery ‘to remember how I felt when I won’. Meanwhile, Mr Williams, a retired construction worker, wants to treat his family and buy a new car and some rugby memorabilia. ‘Whatever we do we’ll be wise and make things comfortable, it’s an amazing amount to enable Michael and I to have security at this time of life,’ Ms Wood added. Ms Wood and Mr Williams, who are both originally from Wales, matched five main numbers and the bonus ball in the Lotto draw on March 12.
