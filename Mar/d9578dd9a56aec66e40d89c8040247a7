Rapper Boosie Badazz has defended an event he hosted where he and his son appeared to inspect women’s genitals with a magnifying glass. Footage from his Boosie Gone Bad pay-per-view event was posted on his Instagram Live feed, with Boosie reportedly telling his son, 18, to ‘look at the p***y.’ The clip goes on to show Boosie using a magnifying glass and appearing to inspect a model’s genitals. Addressing the footage, which drew criticism from viewers, Boosie uploaded a 40-second clip on Instagram. ‘Just woke up to the shenanigans to me and my son. See what they do y’all flipping out and try to make it f**ked up,’ he said. ‘But if an 18-year-old man looking at some p***y is wrong, what is right for him to look at?’ Last year, Boosie also faced criticism after he launched a homophobic tirade against Lil Nas X. The 38-year-old rapper called Lil Nas X, who came out as gay in 2019, a ‘lil f****t a**’ and a ‘disrespectful motherf***er’, after the Montero star tweeted that he and Jack Harlow decided to perform their song Industry Baby ‘butt naked at the VMAs for charity’. While the tweet appeared to be a joke, Boosie fumed about the post while defending DaBaby, who has been widely criticised and has lost endorsement deals due to comments he made at Rolling Loud about people with HIV and AIDS. Speaking on an Instagram Live, Boosie – real name Torrence Ivy Hatch Jr. – said: ‘Everybody not with their nephew sucking d***. Everybody not with that s***. You just can’t just put that s*** on everybody and expect it to be cool. ‘Nas X say he wanna perform naked onstage for charity. You don’t f*** with him like you f*** with DaBaby. You know, be even-sided, man, be even-sided. You don’t feel that disrespect? Going [to] dance naked? You don’t think that’s disrespect in front of boys who trying to be straight? It’s totally disrespect.’ He went on: ‘If I’m at an awards and he go up there naked, I’ma drag his a** offstage and beat his ass. You let a n***a dance naked in front your children, you a motherf***in’ crazy motherf***er—or you like d*** too.’ Boosie previously caused outrage when he claimed that he he paid for oral sex for his underage son and nephews.
