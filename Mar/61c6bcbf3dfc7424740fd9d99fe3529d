Cat lovers can experience the ultimate feline destination at a café in Medellin, Colombia. Cats roam free while visitors drink and dine – and play with the furry animals that show interest. Called La Gatoria, the cats at the cafe are all sick and available to be rehomed by anyone that forms a bond and wants to provide a forever home. It all began seven years ago, when Liliana Zuluaga decided to be a volunteer collecting cats suffering from leukemia. Five years ago she was able to finance the foundation and open a cafeteria, which is now La Gatoria. In her own words, it’s a café where cats live and can be taken in. Within this space, there will always be 10 cats that can be rehomed, though some are already taken and enjoy being in the café still. One popular cat that recently began the process of being rehomed is Ofelia (the tabby in the first picture below). She was rescued and though originally Liliana wanted her to stay, plenty of takers showed interest. A flight to Colombia to see these cute cats probably isn’t on the cards for most of us – so here’s a look at life inside La Gatoria. Do you have a story to share?
