A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a mother-of-two was stabbed to death while her children were at school. The victim of the attack in Bethnal Green, east London, has been named as 40-year-old Yasmin Begum, who was from the area. Police detained a 40-year-old suspect in Stratford today and he remains in police custody. School staff raised the alarm after 4pm on Thursday when Ms Begum did not arrive to pick her children up.
