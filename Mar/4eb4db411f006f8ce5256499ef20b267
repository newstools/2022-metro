Aldi has a number of offers in the middle aisle every week – called Specialbuys. From egg chairs to bedding, and fire pits to gin, there are always some great deals to be found. If you’re planning ahead to visit the iconic middle aisle – or you prefer to get your bargains online – we’ve got you covered. Here are our top picks of this week’s Aldi Specialbuys. Aldi’s furniture game is particularly strong this week, with on-trend items for your home and pets – all at the same budget prices you’d expect from the German supermarket. Is space tight in your hallway or bedroom? This slimline mirror also has four coat hooks and a shelf to store shoes. Plus, it’s freestanding and therefore renter-friendly. Available to pre-order for £59.99 on the Aldi website now. Scalloped furnishings are huge right now, but the price of Aldi’s velvet shell chairs is anything but. At £109.99 each, they’re almost £300 cheaper than similar accent chairs at Oliver Bonas – but still just as chic. Get yours on the Aldi website now. Speaking of chic home furnishings, they don’t have to be reserved for humans. Aldi has brought back its sell-out pet beds designed to look like tiny sofas, and these shell chairs are ideal if you like your furry friend to be your mini-me. They’re suitable for small dogs and cats, and available in grey or blue at £44.99 each. Available to order on the Aldi website now. This pillow uses an inner shaped foam core and cushioning hollowfibre to provide better neck support while you sleep and improve your overall posture. Better still, it’s just £12.99. Available online and in Aldi stores from today. You can order online and find more Specialbuys on the Aldi website.
