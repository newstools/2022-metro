An ex-military dog handler has issued a stark warning about one of the most dangerous plants in Britain after his dog suffered nasty burns on his face. Photos taken by Barry O’Connell, 75, show the painful red blisters that have appeared on the nose and left eye of his four-year-old retriever Winston. The devastated owner has urged people to stay away from giant hogweed as he suspects Winston must have brushed past one while out on a walk this month. Mr O’Connell, from Clacton, in Essex, said: ‘Looking at him like this is like seeing a Rolls Royce breaking down. ‘We live in a popular seaside area. You imagine letting your dog or children out and then they run into something like this and it’s game over. ‘I just can’t understand why there aren’t any warning signs. Not to scare people but to educate them.’ Winston, who serves as his assistance dog, has since been put on antibiotics and has a cone around his head to help with his recovery. Giant hogweed is a common, cow parsley-like plant that is often found along hedgerows in the UK. When it is fully grown, it can reach towering heights of between 1.5 to five metres, and have a spread of between one and two metres. The sap of the plant can cause burns to dogs and people, with blistering potentially lasting for years, according to the Woodland Trust. The charity advises avoiding physical contact with the plant and seeking medical help if blisters do appear. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
