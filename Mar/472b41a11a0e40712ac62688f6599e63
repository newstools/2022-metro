England captain Courtney Lawes was proud of side’s efforts in Paris despite the defeat that saw France seal their first Six Nations triumph in 12 years. Les Blues ran in three tries to seal a 25-13 win at the Stade de France to take the Grand Slam. Eddie Jones’ side settle for third place with the gap between themselves and the champions clearly evident in the French capital. France held a healthy half-time lead thanks to tries from Gael Fickou and Francois Cros. While Freddie Steward did pull one back, the hosts never looked in real danger of surrendering their lead with captain Antoine Dupont sealing the win. Assessing his side’s performance, Lawes insisted he felt there were opportunities for England to capitalise against a tiring France side – lamenting their ability to take them. ‘It’s pretty disappointing, to be honest,’ Lawes told ITV. ‘We certainly had them in fitness, we felt like they were getting tired and just failed to capitalise, essentially. ‘That’s on us, we’ve got a lot to learn, but I’m proud of the boys’ efforts.’ ‘We’d have loved to have come out here and got the win. I really thought we were going to do it at a few stages in the game, but we didn’t capitalise well enough.’ Ireland meanwhile settled for second place, clinching their first Triple Crown in four years after their win over Scotland.
