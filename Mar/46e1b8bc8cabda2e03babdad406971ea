The Duchess of Cambridge has shown once again that The Vampire’s Wife is a fashion label worth keeping a close eye on. Kate Middleton donned a bright pink floor-length Light Sleeper dress by designer Susie Cave on a trip she’s on with Prince William to celebrate The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. The £2,500 gown was paired with silver high-heeled Jimmy Choo ‘Mimi’ sandals, a black and white embroidered clutch, and sparkling circular drop earrings by O’nitaa. The Vampire’s Wife has been a favourite among Royal fashionistas for some time now. Princess Beatrice has worn a deep green number to occasions like Ellie Goulding and Caspar Jopling’s wedding, and Sara Parker Bowles wore a blue velvet Festival dress to the nuptials of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Kate herself wore a green Falconetti, made with silk metallic chiffon, in March 2020 during a three-day tour of Ireland. The brand is also popular among red carpet royalty, with the likes of Zawe Ashton, Rachel Weisz, and Margot Robbie wearing The Vampire’s Wife in recent years. While you’ll struggle to get your hands on a pink Light Sleeper, you can still buy The Falconetti if you wanted to get the look, but at £1,595, it doesn’t come cheap. You can also get floral versions of The Light Sleeper for either £895 or £1,650 depending on the pattern. Do you have a story to share?
