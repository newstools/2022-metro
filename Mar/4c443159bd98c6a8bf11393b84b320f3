Steven Gerrard has hit back at Bukayo Saka’s complaints after the Arsenal winger called for more protection from the referee during the 1-0 victory over Aston Villa on Saturday. Saka scored Arsenal’s winning goal in the first half to keep Mikel Arteta’s side in the driving seat to finish fourth in the Premier League this season. However, Saka was unhappy with some of the tackles from Aston Villa’s players during the match and even voiced his frustrations to referee Andrew Madley. ‘I wasn’t complaining but I wanted to let him know that is my game, I’m going to run at players,’ Saka said. ‘Sometimes I need a bit more protection when players are purposely trying to kick me. That’s all I was letting him know.’ But Gerrard insists Saka should have no complaints about the treatment he received from Villa’s players. ‘He said we were too rough? They didn’t commit any fouls today?’ said the Aston Villa manager. ‘Listen, it’s part of the game. ‘The last time I checked, it isn’t a no-contact sport. I think tackles are allowed, physicality is allowed, aggression is allowed. ‘He [Saka] is a good player, an outstanding talent. I love him. But he can’t complain about that side of it. That’s football. ‘I’m sitting here now with screws in my hips. I’ve had about 16 operations. I’m struggling to go to the gym at the moment. That’s all on the back of earning a living in English football. He’ll learn and he’ll learn quick.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
