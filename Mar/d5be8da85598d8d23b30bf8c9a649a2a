There is a solution only for the organization of humanitarian corridors.’ Negotiators say a third round of talks will take place shortly.

Russian negotiators confirmed that both sides had agreed to creating a way out for civilians. ‘The main question that we decided on today was the issue of saving people, civilians, who are in the zone of military clashes,’ Russia’s main negotiator and former culture minister, Vladimir Medinsky, said. ‘Russia calls on civilians who find themselves in this situation, if military actions continue, to use these humanitarian corridors.’ Another Russian negotiator, nationalist lawmaker Leonid Slutsky, said the agreements would be ‘implemented in the near future.’ Moscow continues to claim it does not target civilian areas, despite overwhelmingly evidence to the contrary.
