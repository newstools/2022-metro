Thousands of Spotify, Facebook, Youtube, WhatsApp and Discord users have had services restored after outages prevented people from accessing their accounts. Downdetector, a website which tracks reports or outages online, showed a spike in issues with a number of popular platforms. The monitoring site showed it started receiving reports of an issue at around 6pm. Music fans reported being signed out of Spotify and being unable to sign back in. Some also said it appears as though their accounts ‘never existed’ and ‘cannot be found’. The area most affected by the outage appeared to be London, followed by Birmingham. On Twitter, the music and podcast streaming service acknowledged ‘something’s not quite right’ and thanked users for their reports of an issue. But the problems weren’t just limited to Spotify other services also experienced issues in the outage which lasted around two hours. Discord has said it was ‘aware of an issue causing message failures’ and was ‘working on a fix’. The platform apologised to users and advised everyone it was ‘time to go outside’. Users also reported problems with Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp and TikTok. As of 7pm issues with Spotify appeared to be easing with the number of reports of problems to Downdetector declining. At 8.20pm the music streaming platform tweeted: ‘Many customers were recently having problems logging in and reaching customer support. Things are looking better, but if you’re still having issues, please reach out to us again.’ Discord also reported at around 8pm that its platform was ‘back up and running for messages, calls and streams! We are still working on a few things like attachments and typing events, but those should come back online soon.’ Downdetector only reports an incident when the number of reports is significantly higher than the typical volume for that time of day.
