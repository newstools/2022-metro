Rupert Grint has revealed his daughter is basically a Weasley after sharing the toddler to Harry Potter, adding that she also already has her own wand at 21 months old. After first playing the role of Ron Weasley in 2002, the actor’s love for Harry Potter has been passed on to his daughter Wednesday, who he shares with his partner, actor Georgia Groome. While making an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, the talk show host said to Rupert: ‘Now you have this beautiful baby and one day you’re going to show her these movies one day and say: “That’s daddy!”’ ‘I’ve already started showing her the trailers,’ the 33-year-old responded, before adding: ‘She has a wand and a PEZ dispenser with my head on it.’ That wasn’t the only revelation Rupert made on the show about his daughter, who was born in May 2020. The Servant star also admitted how Wednesday’s propensity for saying a particular rude word could turn heads in public, after she began speaking. ‘She says: ‘Dada, she says Mama, it was kind of at the same time. And also, the F-word came pretty quick!’ he said. Rupert explained that he was rehearsing his lines for Apple TV’s Servant in his dressing room in front of his daughter, with his character Julian Pearce frequently saying the word ‘f***’ in his dialogue. ‘Now she just says it whenever she’s excited,’ he laughed. ‘We were in the toy store today and she was just walking around dropping it.’ Rupert said that while his daughter’s unexpected rude language sparks a ‘mixed reaction’ from other people, he might inadvertently ‘encourage’ it. ‘It’s kind of a mixed reaction. We find it hilarious, so it’s kind of encouraging it,’ he remarked. Earlier this year, Rupert shared an adorable snap of Wednesday on Instagram, showing her sitting in her very own seat on the set of Servant season three. At the beginning of the year, the original cast from the films about the teenage wizard and his friends reunited to discuss their experiences in a special marking 20 years since The Philosopher’s Stone was released. During a frank conversation on the special, Rupert opened up to Hermione Granger actor Emma Watson how at one point, he considered quitting the franchise, admitting that he ‘contemplated what life would be like if I called it a day’. The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon airs on NBC in the US. Got a story?
