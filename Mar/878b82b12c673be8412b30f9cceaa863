Manchester United legend Gary Neville admits he favours Paris Saint-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino over Ajax manager Erik ten Hag. The Dutchman is now United’s favoured choice to become the club’s new manager, having impressed club officials during an interview last week. Pochettino has twice attracted United’s attention in the past but United opted for Jose Mourinho in 2016 and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2018. The Argentine is keen on moving to Old Trafford but his reputation has taken a hit during his 15 months with Paris Saint-Germain and there are now reservations over his ability to control a star-studded squad. Neville has publicly backed moves for both Thomas Tuchel and Diego Simeone, but United are focused on hiring either Pochettino and Ten Hag. The former United skipper took the question of who to hire to his Twitter account on Wednesday, devising a poll for supporters to pick between the pair. Ten Hag was comfortably ahead in the polls, with United fans feeling the young and up-and-coming Dutchman is the right man for Old Trafford. Reports Ten Hag as been interviewed this week. If formal interviews have started and with it being such a public process I would expect a new manager announcement within a week or so. Who do United fans want?’ asked Neville. The former England defender then commented on the poll – which showed Ten Hag as the clear winner on 81% – saying he’d prefer to see Pochettino at the Theatre of Dreams. ‘Personally I would go for Pochettino but Ten Hag is the massive favourite of United fans to take the club forward,’ said Neville. ‘That’s if it is a clear choice between the 2.’ MORE : Mercedes could have F1 upgrades in Saudi Arabia to help Lewis Hamilton title challenge For more stories like this, check our sport page.
