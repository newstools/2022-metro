 This is the shocking moment a speeding car ploughs into the back of a learner driver before fleeing on foot. CCTV cameras captured the stationary VW indicating to turn right as it was slammed by the reckless Audi driver. The impact sends the red hatchback careering into a van and spinning several times, while the Audi smashes into a fence. The male Audi driver quickly exits the vehicle and runs away from the scene in Stourbridge, West Midlands, as bystanders rushed to help. Miraculously, nobody was seriously injured in the collision just after 6pm on Tuesday. One witness said: ‘The little red car had done nothing wrong, they were just indicating to turn at the time. ‘The Audi driver then came flying over the bridge and tried to brake but by then it was too late and he just smashed into the back of the other car. ‘A couple of people tried to run after him when he tried to leg it but I don’t think they managed to catch up. ‘It’s incredible nobody was badly hurt, it could have been a lot worse. Both cars were a right mess.’ A police spokesperson said: ‘The road was closed following the collision. The driver of one vehicle fled the scene. A woman was taken to hospital with injuries not believed to be too serious.’ An ambulance spokesperson added: ‘We were called at 6.15pm to reports of a road traffic collision involving two cars at the junction of Bridge Street and Camp Hill in Wordsley, Stourbridge. ‘Two ambulances, two paramedic officers and a Critical Care Car from Midlands Air Ambulance attended the scene. ‘Upon arrival we found a man who was the driver of the first car. He was assessed at the scene and had sustained injuries not believed to be serious. ‘He received treatment on scene and was conveyed to Russells Hall Hospital for further assessment. No further patients required assessment.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
