New pictures show the Queen charming Justin Trudeau as she held her first in-person engagement since recovering from Covid. The Canadian prime minister was spotted laughing as he greeted the 95-year-old monarch at Windsor Castle today. Her Majesty looked happy and healthy after concerns were raised when she came down with the virus last month. She acknowledged her frailty for the first time in February, saying ‘as you can see, I can’t move’ during a royal engagement. The walking stick she has been using recently was not in sight on Monday. Buckingham Palace previously said the Queen had suffered ‘mild Covid symptoms’. Prince Charles revealed last Tuesday his mother was ‘a lot better now’. Mr Trudeau is in the UK for talks on the war in Ukraine with Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte. There is an intense diplomatic effort to build a united front against Vladimir Putin as homes and hospitals are bombed by his troops. The Queen has a strong bond with Canada and the Commonwealth realm has been her most frequent overseas destination. It comes as the Head of State has two high-profile events in the near future. She is expected to attend the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March 14. Her beloved late husband’s memorial service will also be held at the abbey on March 29. Last autumn she pulled out of attending the Cop26 climate change summit, the Festival of Remembrance and then the Remembrance Sunday Cenotaph service due to a sprained back.
