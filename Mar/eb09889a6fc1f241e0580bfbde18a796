More than one million people have been forced to leave their homes behind since war began in Ukraine. The exodus was described as the swiftest of its kind this century, the United Nations said, and amounts to more than 2% of the entire population. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing international isolation after launching his brutal attack, costing the lives of thousands of civilians and soldiers. NATO members and the European Union have been providing weapons, military hardware and humanitarian relief to Ukraine, while sanctioning Russia – but only a handful of countries have backed Putin.
