Manchester United are under fresh pressure to appoint a new permanent manager with both Mauricio Pochettino and Erik ten Hag attracting interest from rival clubs. Ajax boss Ten Hag had an interview with United on Monday with reports suggesting the talks were ‘positive’ with the Dutchman detailing his philosophy and vision for the club. Pochettino meanwhile has long been sought after at Old Trafford and is expected to be formally interviewed soon. The Mail report United could still be weeks away from making a final decision but with clubs elsewhere in Europe also circling, United may need to move quickly. The report states that two clubs, who both competed in the Champions League this term, have spoken to ten Hag, with one of them making him a firm offer ahead of next season. Reports in Netherlands meanwhile suggest the 52-year-old could even still remain at Ajax beyond the current campaign. Pochettino meanwhile is thought to be a possible option for Real Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has guided the club to the top of La Liga and into the quarter-finals of the Champions League – knocking out Pochettino’s PSG in the process – this season but bosses at the Bernabeu are understood to be considering a change, not convinced by the Italian’s playing style. Pochettino has also recently hinted he could yet remain in the French capital, determined to win the Champions League with the club after this season’s humiliating exit. Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui is also thought to be on United’s shortlist along with Spain manager Luis Enrique. However, the latter’s preference is to stay in charge until after Spain’s World Cup campaign at the end of the year.
