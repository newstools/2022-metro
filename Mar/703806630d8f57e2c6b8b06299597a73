The Apprentice viewers all have the same question after Lord Alan Sugar declared that Harpreet Kaur had won his £250,000 investment: what about her sister? The latest series of the BBC competition show came to an end on Thursday night, with Harpreet’s dessert business beating Kathryn Burn’s pyjama business to the top spot. While many fans were delighted with the result, some couldn’t help but voice their concern for the winner’s sister, who was revealed to be the co-founder of her company in last week’s chapter. Many will remember how Harpreet told Lord Sugar during the Interviews episode that she would happily ask her sister to step down from their venture should he decide to invest. ‘If you didn’t want her as a shareholder or director, fine, she’s prepared to step down,’ she told him. ‘But she’s a 50% owner isn’t she, at the moment?’ Lord Sugar asked, prompting Harpreet to confirm: ‘She is, that’s correct.’ ‘How can you just tell somebody they no longer own 50% of the business that Lord Sugar is investing in which is going to be worth 20, 30, 50 times more in five years time?’ he asked. ‘That’s not a problem, Lord Sugar,’ Harpreet vowed. After Harpreet was told she had been hired, many viewers rushed to social media to question what would become of the businesswoman’s sister. ‘So the big question is, what about Harpreets sister?’ asked one, while another penned: ‘So what’s gonna happen to Harpreet’s sister now?’ Others hazarded a guess that Harpreet’s sibling would now be on the hunt for a brand new job. Luckily though, it seems as though her sister is still involved in the winning business, Oh So Yum, as the social media page recently posted a video introducing her. ‘Meet Guv, our lovely co-founder👋🏽’ the caption for the clip read. ‘Guv works hard to make sure customers have the best experience when they visit our parlour as well as making sure that our fantastic team are always happy🙌🏽 ‘Co-founder, best friend and sister wrapped up in one, she really is a star⭐We couldn’t do it without her.’ Harpreet became the show’s 17th winner – after two candidates were offered investment in series 14 – and follows in the footsteps of the series 15 champion Carina Lepore, who also developed a business for those with a sweet tooth with her London-based bakery chain Dough Artisan Bakehouse. Carina won The Apprentice in 2019 before the show was forced to take a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Apprentice is available to stream on BBC iPlayer. Got a story?
