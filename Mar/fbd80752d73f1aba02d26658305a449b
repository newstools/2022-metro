One of London’s oldest Polish bars has created a new drink dedicated to Ukraine and is donating the proceeds to help the country. The team at Ognisko Polskie, in South Kensington, have fashioned a new drink and named it after the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The beverage is made up of Kavka vodka, blue curaçao, lemon juice, apricot brandy and sugar syrup, and is blue and yellow in colour – paying homage to the Ukrainian flag. Every time someone orders a Zelenskyy a donation will be made to Choose Love’s Ukraine Crisis Fundraiser. In a newsletter, staff commented: ‘We are all looking for meaningful ways to help but also realising that nothing is quite enough. ‘However, we have to believe that even the smallest individual donation, gift, message of support, if multiplied by millions can have an enormous effect.’ The bar also hosted a fundraising event last night (March 5), featuring Ukrainian music and a three-course meal. All the money raised will go to Caritas, an organisation that has been working in Poland and Ukraine to support those who have fled their homes. A silent auction will also be held online this week – and more details on this are to be announced soon. Ognisko Polskie follows in the footsteps of Airbnb in pledging to help out during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The CEO of the online accommodation platform has said the business will provide free, short-term accommodation for 100,000 refugees fleeing Ukraine. Do you have a story to share?
