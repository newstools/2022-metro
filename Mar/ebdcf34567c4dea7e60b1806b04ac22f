Here are some things you might have in common with Misty the cat: she loves to sleep, she’s a gorgeous girl, and she’s getting on a bit. If that sounds like the feline version of you, why not give this 17-year-old puss a home? Misty has been waiting to meet her match for quite some time – 260 days, to be exact. The cat arrived at Llys Nini Animal Centre after being found as a stray, tangled up in barbed wire. An RSPCA officer cut her free, then the rest of the wire was removed by the vets. Thankfully, Misty recovered well. But in the midst of that treatment, blood tests revealed that Misty has stage two renal (kidney) disease. This – coupled with her age – has put people off rehoming the lovely cat. But all Misty really needs is a little extra care. She eats a special type of food that can be bought online, takes a medication, and needs her blood pressure checked every one to three months and her urine checked for protein every three months. Beyond that, she’s a low-maintenance kind of girl, happy to be left alone to relax – although she’d love a nice comfy bed. Misty is looking for a home where she’d be the only pet and there are no children. If you reckon you could give her the retirement home this sweet old lady has been looking for, you can get in touch with the animal centre through their website. Do you have a story to share?
