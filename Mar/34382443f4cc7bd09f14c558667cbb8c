The Duke of Sussex will not return to the UK to attend Prince Philip’s memorial service on March 29, a spokesperson has said. Prince Harry is in the midst of legal battle with the Home Office over its refusal to pay for police protection for his family. He lives in the United States with his wife, Meghan Markle and their two children, but he wants access to police protection when visiting the UK. He took the Home Office to the High Court after being told he would no longer be given the ‘same degree’ of security on visits, despite offering to pay for it himself. The duke says he wants to bring his children over from California to visit, but says he is ‘unable to return to his home’ because it is too dangerous for his family, a legal representative previously said. As the row continues, a spokesperson for Harry said he could not attend the service of thanksgiving for Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, at Westminster Abbey. Harry was last in London in the summer of 2021 for the unveiling of a memorial statue for his late mother Diana, the Princess of Wales. A legal representative for the duke has since said his security was compromised after his car was chased by paparazzi photographers as he left a charity event. When Harry visited the UK in April for Prince Philip’s funeral, Harry was met by Scotland Yard protection officers on the tarmac of Heathrow Airport, but he was not given the same level of security in July. It is understood Harry hopes to visit his grandmother the Queen soon, but it is unclear when that will be. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
