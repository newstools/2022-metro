People in the UK will receive loud, siren-like sound notifications on their mobile phones in case of an incident like an explosion – but not everyone will be eligible for them. Set to launch later this year, the new technology, developed by the government, will be activated during emergencies that pose a threat to life. That would include flooding during storms like Eunice, large fires or a public health crisis. The service comes to light following Russian president Vladimir Putin’s bloody war, which has claimed the lives of at least 352 civilians, including 16 children, in Ukraine, according to the latest official figures from Sunday. Air raid sirens have sounded in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv and in Lviv, in the western part of the country, to warn people of potential bombing, prompting them to seek refuge in nearby bomb shelters. In the UK, ’emergency alerts’ were trialed last summer and the service is expected to launch in early 2022. Such tests were conducted in Reading and Berkshire in June but since then, no further updates have been given. According to the government website, people will receive alerts based on their location at that exact time, not where they live or work. The emergency alerts will only work if the phone is on, and if it has all the latest software updates. For iPhones, this is iOS 14.5 or later and for Andoid phones and tablets, it is Android 11 or later – any devices with older software or those, which have run out of battery or are turned off will not receive them. Phones and tablets connected to a 2G or 3G network will also not receive the alerts. Metro.co.uk has contacted the government for a comment.
