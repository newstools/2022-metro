Heather Knight led from the front as England’s wait for a first Women’s World Cup victory ended in emphatic fashion with a comfortable four-wicket victory over India at Mount Maunganui. Holders England went into the game needing a win to keep their slim hopes of qualifying for the semi finals alive after losing their opening three matches. England managed to eradicate the fielding mistakes, which had proved costly against the West Indies and South Africa in particular, to bowl India out for just 134, with Charlie Dean finishing with four wickets in only her second World Cup match. Knight then steered England home with the bat as they chased down India’s below-par total with 17 overs remaining. Tammy Beaumont and Danni Wyatt were both out for just one run to leave England starting their chase at four for two and the warning signs were there before a resurgence from Knight and Nat Sciver. Sciver made 45 and Knight played a captains innings, seeing her side over the line as she finished unbeaten on 53. Speaking after the match, Knight said: ‘It was a bit of relief, we needed that but it was a bit sloppy. We were disappointed with our fielding was going. ‘But good to see the team do well. Our bowlers were outstanding, wasn’t an easy pitch to bat on but Ecclestone and Dean made it difficult. ‘The pitch was slow, was tricky and I really wanted to finish it off today. Congratulations to Goswami for her milestone. The cricket gods seemed to be on our side. Nat was outstanding, took the pressure off me on a tricky wicket.’ MORE : Joe Root can take positives from West Indies opener but poor World Cup decisions cost England Women For more stories like this, check our sport page.
