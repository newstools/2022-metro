It’s hot cross bun season, making weekend mornings that bit toastier and flavourful. However, they needn’t be enjoyed only at breakfast now, as Aldi is launching a gin liqueur that captures the flavour. Set to arrive in time for Easter, the new drink will land on shelves March 31. As an adult Easter treat, why not try a sweet alcoholic tipple? Whether for a gathering, party, or quiet night in, hot cross buns now have a place in liquid form. The Infusionist Hot Cross Bun Gin Liqueur will sell for £8.99. The unique liqueur blends caramel, raisin and gin flavours for a fun hot cross bun inspired drink. There’s also a subtle hit of spice, making it rich and moreish. At 20% ABV, you can have it neat, with ice, or making a cocktail of sorts. Aldi recommend mixing it in with ginger ale and a slice of fresh orange, or going for a hot cross bun espresso martini. Alongside this drink, Aldi is launching new hot cross bun flavours, such as strawberries and cream and triple chocolate. M&S also stocks a hot cross bun flavoured liqueur that’s already on sale, if waiting until the end of the month feels too far away. The difference however, is that M&S’ offering is a cream liqueur, like Baileys. Super fans of the flavour may as well try both varieties and get into the Easter mood. If that’s not enough, Kellogg’s is releasing a hot cross bun flavoured cereal too. There’s an abundance of choice… even while Greggs is breaking our hearts by ditching the classic Easter treat.
