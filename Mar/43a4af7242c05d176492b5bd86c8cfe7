Netflix has suspended its service in Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, the company said today. Earlier this week, the streaming service temporarily stopped all future projects and acquisitions in Russia as it assessed the impact of Vladimir Putin’s attack. ‘Given the circumstances on the ground, we have decided to suspend our service in Russia,’ a Netflix spokesperson said. Netflix had previously said it wouldn’t comply with a new law requiring large streamers to host 20 Russian propaganda channels such as NTV and Channel One.
