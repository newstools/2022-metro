An island hotel is hoping to build another 27 rooms just for its staff so they have somewhere affordable to live. The Burgh Island Hotel, in South Devon, wants to provide the accommodation in order to attract employees put off by high property prices in the area. It is part of an £8million revamp at the luxury hotel, which counts Agatha Christie, Noël Coward, Sir Winston Churchill and The Beatles among its former guests. A night in a standard double room costs £470 a night, while a more secluded beach house offering panoramic sea views would set you back £940. ‘We need to find the staff, accommodate the staff and with that we hope to keep the staff,’ said owner Giles Fuchs. ‘They cannot afford to rent locally, we cannot afford to buy them houses locally.’ He explained that it was ‘hard to attract and keep staff due in part to the expensive property prices in the local area’. The average price for homes in the area is £418,000. The Grade II-listed art deco hotel will offer 11 rooms for its employees in place of the current tennis courts on the 49-acre island site, plus 16 rooms on the mainland, next to a new cafe building. The island is cut off from the mainland at high tide and visitors can only get there on a sea tractor. Mr Fuchs added: ‘I would really prefer not to spend millions of pounds on having to build staff accommodation, but we have no other choice if we want to get and retain staff.’ The plans will be considered by South Hams District Council.
