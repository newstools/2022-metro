Marcus Rashford is considering his future at Manchester United due to concerns over his lack of playing time, according to reports. The 24-year-old started as a substitute for United’s 4-1 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, despite Ralf Rangnick not having Cristiano Ronaldo, Edinson Cavani, Anthony Martial or Mason Greenwood in his squad. Rashford has struggled for form in recent months, scoring just two goals in his last 20 appearances in all competitions. The England international has started just one of United’s last five Premier League games and was even left as an unused substitute in the 4-2 victory over Leeds United last month. And according to The Guardian, Rashford, who came through United’s academy, is now ‘giving serious consideration’ to leaving Old Trafford at the end of the season. Rashford is out of contract next year but United have the option to extend for an additional year. When asked why he started without a recognised forward for United’s derby against City, United’s interim manager Ralf Rangnick said: ‘We didn’t have that many strikers available for the game today. ‘And for us, the question was do we play with Marcus to start with or do we play a false nine like Bruno and have one more midfielder on the pitch and make sure we win balls there and have enough players? ‘It was clear they will always try to create numerical superiority in the middle of the pitch and that is why I decided to play with Bruno as a false nine.’ The defeat means United are now fifth in the Premier League, a point behind fourth-placed Arsenal who have three games in hand.
