Frankie Cocozza is a far cry from his hell and hair-raising days on The X Factor, living with his young family in Australia 11 years later. The 29-year-old’s impressively styled yet messy barnet became his calling card on the popular ITV show’s eighth series, which Little Mix ultimately won. Marrying his wife Bianca Murphy in 2018, and welcoming his namesake son in 2019, the family has now upped sticks to Sydney, Australia. The singer shared a recent selfie to his Instagram, staring into the camera and wearing a white shirt with a blue shacket over the top. However, the most striking thing about his appearance was the floppy-haired, slicked back do the rocker was sporting, transforming his look. Frankie’s followers were here for his transformation, with several telling him he was ‘looking good’. ‘Young Frankie that I’ve been following for 10 years has grown into a man,’ one joked. Another commented: ‘Looking well Frankie boy! 👏’ The former Celebrity Big Brother contestant, who came runner up to Loose Women panellist and former Coronation Street star Denise Welch in 2012, shared more snaps to his account of his new life Down Under, including one of him smiling broadly as he sat in a corner establishment. ‘Getting old x’, he quipped. A photo from over the past weekend at Bondi Beach saw Frankie pointing gleefully at the camera, dressed in brown slacks and a purple polo shirt and captioned ‘Bondi has him now’. The star was ejected from The X Factor in November 2011, with the then 18-year-old releasing a statement that read: ‘I’d like to apologise to [mentor] Gary [Barlow], my fellow contestants and everyone who has voted for me, but, as of today, I will no longer be in The X Factor. ‘My life during the show has gone out of control and my behaviour off stage has overstepped the rules of the competition.’ He famously bared his bum on the show, and revealed the names of the seven girls he’d bedded at the time of his audition. Frankie, who also appeared on 4’s Celebs Go Dating in 2017, confessed to blowing his £200,000 fortune on drink in the years that followed his reality TV show debut. He also told The Mirror that he was working on a building site for £7.50 an hour at the time as he ‘needed a reason to get up in the morning’. Since then, he has tied the knot with wife Bianca and welcomed Frankie (technically Frankie the fourth, following on from the contestant’s father and grandfather’s names). Confirming the birth, Frankie wrote on Instagram: ‘You’re in for one hell of a ride son. You’ll be absolutely fine because you’re half your mother.’ Since then, the doting dad has hared various snaps of his young son, including holding him in a swimming pool and to mark Christmas Day in 2019.
