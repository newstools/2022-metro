Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has urged Marcus Rashford to get his f*****g head out of his a**e’ in order to become the club’s record scorer in years to come. The England forward has come under fierce criticism this term for his performances, which have been well below-par. Rashford is believed to be considering his future at Old Trafford because of a lack of playing time, with the 24-year-old falling out of favour under Ralf Rangnick. The forward clash with a supporter after he was heckled following United’s 1-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League, when Rashford was dismal after coming on as a substitute. Rooney played with Rashford for two years at Old Trafford and he mentored the youngster as he broke into the first-team. But the Derby County boss has clearly run out of patience with Rashford, who he has urged to sort his head out in order to become a legend at Old Trafford. ‘To get the record and be Manchester United’s  highest goal scorer is f***ing massive,’ said Rooney.‘What I hope is that Marcus Rashford f***ing gets his head out of his a*** and goes and breaks that record. He is a Manchester lad.’ Rooney broke Sir Bobby Charlton’s scoring record in his final season at the Theatre of Dreams by scoring a sensational free-kick away at Stoke. The former Everton man scored 253 goals in all for United, where he spent 13 years before returning to Goodison Park.
