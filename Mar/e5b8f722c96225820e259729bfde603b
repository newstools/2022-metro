A leaked schematic shows that the bext iPhone might feature the biggest design change yet by getting rid of the notch. With another iPhone round the corner, rumors about potential design changes are abound and it looks like the iPhone 14 might have the biggest changes yet. The ‘notch’ was was introduced back in 2017 on the iPhone X and has since been a point of annoyance for Apple users. The black bar that houses the front-facing cameras takes up considerable space on the front screen, getting in the way while watching films or playing games. The new leak posted to Chinese social media site Weibo, suggests that Apple could finally be ditching the notch in favour of two cut-outs at the top of the screen. The schematic spotted by 9to5Mac, shows the left cut-out to be pill-shaped, while the right is circular. Other smartphone makers including Samsung have got around the notch issue by opting for a hole-punch design, while Huawei uses a pill-cut out for its front-facing cameras as well. However, this is the first time that the two have been combined. Jon Prosser, known for his accurate Apple leaks, pointed out that the new design may actually be more obstructive than the current notch. ‘On this schematic, you can see that it’s actually bigger than everyone thought,’ said Prosser in a video posted to his YouTube channel. ‘This is oddly big. I have independently been able to verify that this is likely the size of this notch cut-out thing for iPhone 14,’ he said. Other rumoured design changes include return of the display Touch ID, a faster A16 Bionic chip, a more titanium alloy body, a flattened rear camera bump, new screen sizes and the death of the iPhone Mini.
