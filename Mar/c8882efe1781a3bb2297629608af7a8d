Okay, so you’ve got the whole ‘drinking water’ thing down. You cart around a bottle wherever you go, taking sips along the way. But – uh oh – your bottle isn’t looking quite as sparkling new as it once did. In fact, you’re tempted to leave it at home, so no one gazes upon your stained bottle and thinks you’re a grubby pup. Don’t panic… or buy a new bottle. One woman has revealed an easy way to clean a stained bottle in moments. Molly East, 22, actually uses the hack for her pets’ water bottle, which had turned a bit green thanks to sunlight exposure. Wanting to revive the bottle belonging to her guinea pigs, Dazza and Andy, and her rabbit, Martha, she remembered a tip her mum once taught her. Here it is: you just add a little water and five pieces of dried penne pasta to the bottle, then shake. ‘It works by the pasta hitting the sides and picking up the greenness at the same time,’ said Molly, a receptionist. Thanks to the trick, the bottle looked brand new. And while pet owners will be pleased, it’s good news for all water-drinkers, as the same technique will work on any bottle. Molly shared the simple tip on Facebook, writing: ‘A trick I learnt from my mum a little bit of water and dried pasta give a shake and gets rid of all green from an animal water bottle in seconds – you literally only need like 5 bits of pasta nothing extreme.’ One person noted that they used a similar method, but with egg shells or uncooked rice – so if you don’t have a healthy stash of penne, you can always try that.
