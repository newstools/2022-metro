Flower girls are a traditional part of a wedding. Usually relations of the bride and groom, the flower girls are picture perfect cuteness. However, one couple in the US put a spin on the custom for their nuptials. Instead of young children throwing petals down the aisle, a Miami couple called on two ‘Fireball fairies’ to hand out miniature bottles of whiskey to guests. In a video shared by @copey106 on TikTok, viewers can see two brightly dressed women dancing down the aisle with coolers of whiskey. Wearing red mini dresses, the pair look jovial and even drink shots at the top of the aisle. A caption on the read: ‘Fireball fairies > Flower girls.’ Not everyone thought highly of the innovative wedding move. ‘Doing too much to have the “quirky” wedding,’ wrote one unimpressed viewer. ‘Absolutely not,’ said another. While a third added: ‘Tacky.’ Thankfully not all viewers were so critical. Many praised the couple for taking a fun approach. ‘Love a unique non-traditional take on something ‘classic,’ noted one commenter. Meanwhile, the poster of the video hit back at trolls criticising the couple’s choice. The comment read: ‘Normalise #fireballfairies or what kind of energy you want!
