A ‘mutant crisp’ has been discovered by a dad who plans to auction his find off for charity. Michael Landford thought he was dreaming when he pulled out the massive snack this week. The peckish 44-year-old had been craving a midnight snack and reached for a cheese and onion bag of Snackrite crisps he’d bought from Aldi. But one crisp unearthed from the packet just ‘kept going and going’ and was almost the length of the packet. Michael told the Sun: ‘I remember the packet feeling particularly bulgy. I put my hand in the bag and clasped onto the first crisp I could find. It was the first one to come out and it kept going and going.’ The crisp’s final measurements have been confirmed to be a respectable six inches. He added: ‘I couldn’t believe my eyes, I thought to myself, “We’ve got something unbelievable here”. Friends and family now call it the “Mutant Crisp”.’ Michael, an online shop owner from Poole, has decided to hang onto the crisp rather than satisfy his hunger. It is being kept in a safe place ahead of Michael’s plans to auction it off and give the proceeds to charities helping Ukrainian refugees. It’s been a successful year for larger-than-usual potato-based foods. Back in August, 26-year-old Sam Lightfoot was the lucky finder of a four-inch-long Hula Hoop. The crisp was eight times the usual length and had only just about fit inside the packet. Proud Sam said he would ‘keep it forever and hand it down through the family’. Meanwhile, an oven chip measuring 7.5 inches in length was also discovered last year. Frank Smith, 77, found the supersized snack in June. Similarly to Sam, he decided it would be far too hard to part with such a special find. He said: ‘I’m never going to eat it. I keep it in its own little space in the top shelf of the freezer. It’s a prized possession now.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
