Paul Gascoigne has been slammed after he deliberately tripped up a young boy before Rangers’ legends match at the weekend. The 54-year-old, who was capped 57 times by England, made a brief cameo at Ibrox as Rangers played a charity game against Luis Figo’s World XI. Gascoigne was given a huge ovation from the crowd and he even managed to get on the scoresheet during his short stint on the pitch. But during the warm up, Gascoigne was at the centre of a bizarre incident as he cruelly sent a boy crashing to the turf after tripping him up. After beckoning the boy to meet him on the pitch, Gascoigne stuck out his leg as the young supporter ran away in the opposite direction. Gascoigne then opted to wave to the crowd before going to check on the boy, who was still on the ground. Gascoigne’s actions have been slammed by fans on social media, while Scottish actor Gianni Capaldi wrote: ‘Woke to this horrible video. Cringeworthy. ‘Hurting a child for admiration, absolute scum of the earth. ‘Any parent would have ran down and knocked him out. Poor kid thought his legend was being kind to him. Gazza you’re a self entitled horrible person who needs help #Rangers Class.’ Speaking about Gascoigne’s appearance at Ibrox, former Rangers manager Alex McLeish said: ‘Gazza was absolutely loving it. ‘He is a little bit teary, but he is absolutely delighted with the reception he got from the fans. ‘You can see how much he loves them.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
