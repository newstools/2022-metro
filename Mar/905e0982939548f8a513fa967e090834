The public have been warned not to approach a convicted killer who has been missing overnight from prison. Police are trying to trace Shane Farrington, 39, who was last seen at HMP Thorn Cross in Appleton, Warrington at 6.45pm yesterday. He was last seen wearing a dark top with white writing on the front, blue jeans, black shoes and a dark coat. He also had a dark rucksuck. He is known to have links in the Peterborough area and anyone who may know where he is has been urged to get in touch with police. But an urgent warning has been issued not to approach him directly, and to call 999. Farrington was convicted of manslaughter in 2009 after attacking and killing a prisoner in his cell at HMP Peterborough on September 11, 2008. He previously escaped prison after running away while being treated at a hospital in Norfolk for a head injury in 2018. Farrington was on the run for two hours where he went through car parks, a farmer’s field and Norwich City’s training ground before being caught by police. Superintendent Mike Evans, from Cheshire Police, said: ‘We currently have numerous officers carrying out a variety of searches to locate Farrington. ‘While our enquiries are ongoing we’re urging anyone who sees Farrington to not approach him but to instead call Cheshire Constabulary immediately on 999 quoting IML 1230000. ‘Officers will be maintaining a presence around the prison and in the local area to provide reassurance to the community. If you have any concerns please do speak to one of them.’ Crimestoppers can also be contacted anonymously with information on 0800 555 111.
