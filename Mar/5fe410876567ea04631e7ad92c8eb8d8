Chaos has been sparked in east London as a huge power cut leaves thousands without traffic lights, internet and water. Roads are ‘hectic and unsafe’ after traffic lights stopped working around 12.30pm, reports on social media suggest. Many Londoners will be unable to work from home as an estimated 5,000 households are impacted in 37 postcodes. Some people have reported having no water at lunchtime as their generators are connected to electricity. Households in Tower Hamlets and Hackney in east London have been hit, the UK Power Networks website suggests. The DLR was suspended but has now resumed on all lines, albeit with minor delays as services start to recover. Rotherhithe, Limehouse Link and Blackwall Tunnels are all closed. Some places in south London – including Southwark, Bromley, Bexley and Mitcham – have also reportedly been impacted. UK Power Networks have said the power cut is due to a ‘fault on a high voltage underground electricity cable’. They expect power to return by 2pm between 3pm. ‘We’re aware of a power cut affecting the #E1, #E1W and #E14 areas of #London. Our engineers are working to get the power on as soon as possible’, they said. Replying to their tweet, a local named Adam Smith said: ‘Finally got myself to the gym after not going for weeks. Two minutes into my run the power went out. No traffic lights on my way home either.’ Someone else named Lauren wrote: ‘Please get it back on ASAP I have to walk up a autistic child in a pram up 13 flights of stairs if no lifts still by time he finishes nursery’. Those affected can DM UK Power Networks on Twitter to request free text updates, or keep informed via their website. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
