Photographer Rachel Lena Esterline, from San Francisco, won the trust of erotic dancers over the last ten years to capture intimate images of their inner lives. Her photos show the women performing on stage, but also hanging out in places like the bath or swimming naked in a pool. Rachel says it was the mystique of the industry that drew her to these subjects. She said: ‘I followed an impulse to enter mysterious territory. ‘It was a calling to explore and unlearn my fears around freedom. ‘Those goddesses commanded space and visibility. ‘Then they took me in like a sister and opened a whole universe of genuine love and respect.’ Rachel aims to change how society views strippers and sex workers. ‘Ultimately,’ she explained, ‘I want people to interact with how real, necessary and beautiful sex workers are. ‘I want to participate in bringing an end to the erasure of their stories.’ After gaining the trust of the dancers inside the strip club, Rachel set up a pole in her own home and inviting the women for a more intimate photoshoot. ‘Individuals who choose to walk this walk every single day have a heightened awareness around things like consent and vulnerability, but most of all, danger,’ said Rachel. ‘In a way, I consent to hold a safe space where they can be fully in power.’ Her plans are to continue to follow the lives of some of the dancers throughout the rest of her career.
