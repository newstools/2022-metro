Stacey Dooley has found herself in all sorts of weird and wonderful places, but perhaps none have been more surreal than in the sweaty changing room of an NFL team packed with naked American football players. It’s a hard life. The Strictly winner and celebrated documentary maker has revealed one of the most awkward moments during her career when she was filming in New Orleans and confronted with a lot of penises. A whole team of penises, in fact. ‘At the end of the game if you’re a reporter you’re allowed in the dressing room,’ she reveals on Paul Sinha’s TV Showdown, alongside guest Fay Ripley, Jon Richardson and Rob Beckett. ‘I walk in and they’re all completely naked. ‘I’m trying to interview them about being a quarter back, I have no idea what the rules are anyway, and I’ve just got various different penis in my face.’ However, Stace grinned and admitted: ‘I had a lovely afternoon.’ Stacey celebrated her 35th birthday this week, throwing bash at her stunning London pad, which she shares with boyfriend Kevin Clifton. Naturally, plenty of celebs sent well-wished to the presenter, including Strictly host Tess Daly, who commented on a picture of Stacey’s birthday bash: ‘Happy birthday beautiful!’ Kevin shared a snap of Stacey, smiling and gazing into her eyes, caption the show with a simple love hart emoji. Paul Sinha’s TV Showdown airs Saturday at 10pm on ITV. Got a story?
