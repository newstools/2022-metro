Thomas Tuchel is settled in England, wants to stay at Chelsea and has given no indication to Manchester United that he would be open to moving to Old Trafford. The German has been linked with a move to the Theatre of Dreams since Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government, which has seen Chelsea’s short and long-term future thrown into chaos. The club are prevented from buying and selling players, while they’ve been given a special license to continue operations until a sale can go through. With Chelsea facing an uncertain future and the very real threat of administration if a sale doesn’t go through, Tuchel has been linked with an exit from Stamford Bridge. But the Evening Standard say Tuchel is committed to Chelsea and has no intention of joining a Premier League rival. He’s given United ‘no indication’ that he’d be open to moving to the north-west, despite being settled in England. Tuchel’s preference is to stay at Chelsea but the prospective new owners will make a decision on his future once they complete a takeover from Abramovich. As for United, their interest in Tuchel was tentative and they’ve been wary of making a public effort for the German so as not to put off other suitors, such as Erik Ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino. United want to make an appointment before the end of the season in order to give clarity to the playing squad.
