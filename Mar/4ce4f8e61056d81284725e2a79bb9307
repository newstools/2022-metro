Four luxury mansions have been demolished after they were found to be larger than they had permission for. The £1,000,000 houses dominated the landscape on the West Pennine Moors but were in breach of planning rules. kAfter they were almost completed, building inspectors found that they were up to a third bigger than they had been given permission for and in different locations. Bolton Council ordered them to be demolished in 2018 and after much wrangling, demolition of the final house started at the weekend. The site is now little more than piles of rubble and the shell of one remaining home. Cllr Andy Morgan said: ‘Four of the five houses have now come down. It’s the right thing to do. ‘There are two applications for individual plots to be built with slight alterations. ‘The intent is to rebuild them and save so much materials, brick by brick.’ Building work to convert a former farm house and build new four homes around a courtyard started in 2014. However, a complaint was filed in October 2016 and inspectors found problems with the new homes building built by Sparkle Developments. One of the homeowners, Elan Raja, said he had paid £1,057,000 for the plot along with £215,000 while waiting for the legal battle to be dealt with. He said he had suffered from severe stress and anxiety due to coping with the immense demands of the legal case and had suffered cardiac problems as a result of the ‘nightmare’ situation. But despite this, council inspectors later decided to give a deadline of May 18, 2022, for all the mansions to be demolished. A spokesperson for Bolton Council said: ‘We will of course continue to monitor the site in the coming weeks to ensure that the requirements of the enforcement notice are complied with in full.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
