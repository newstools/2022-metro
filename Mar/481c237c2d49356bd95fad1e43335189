Ant and Dec are reportedly due back on screens earlier than expected for this year’s I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here as ITV bosses are keen to avoid a clash with the World Cup in November. The popular ITV series was expected to host celebrities in Australia in November. But now, ITV bosses are said to have pushed forward the jungle start date to avoid clashing with the international football coverage. A source told The Sun: ‘Two of ITV’s biggest juggernauts – not just of the season but the whole year – are I’m A Celeb and its international football coverage. ‘So it makes sense to keep them apart, and as the World Cup isn’t going to budge, it makes sense to move Ant and Dec. ‘The last thing anyone wants is for viewers to have to choose between the latest from the jungle and a big game. ‘At the moment nothing has been confirmed – but whatever ITV do will be in the best interests of viewers.’ However, a spokesperson for I’m A Celeb told Metro.co.uk: It’s too early to confirm scheduling for the show.’ The ITV reality series, hosted by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, has spent the past two years at Gwrych Castle in Wales due to travel restrictions during the Covid pandemic meaning the cast and crew were not able to travel Down Under. However, Rosemary Newell, Director of Content, confirmed last month that I’m A Celebrity will finally return its longtime home. ‘We expect a celebrity to return in Australia in November, when it will generate audience over 11 million,’ Newell said. I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here will return to ITV later this year. Got a story?
