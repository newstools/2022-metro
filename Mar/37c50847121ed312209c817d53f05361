Gerwyn Price is out of Premier League Darts in Brighton on Thursday night, and this weekend’s European Tour action at the German Darts Championship with a hand injury. The world number two had travelled to Brighton, spending some time on the practice board, but the injury was too much of a hindrance to compete and he informed the PDC he would have to withdraw at 4pm. Price was due to play Joe Cullen in the quarter-finals in Brighton, but the Yorkshireman will be handed a 6-0 win and a clash with either Michael van Gerwen or James Wade in the semis. The Welshman is training for a charity boxing match, due to be held next month, but says that his hand injury was caused by an accident and not because of his training to step into the ring. The Iceman tweeted on Thursday afternoon: ‘I apologise to everyone, this wasn’t the easiest decision. ‘I have done everything I can to get my injury right before I play but unfortunately a few days rest for me. ‘Just to clarify that my injury was an accident and nothing to do with my charity boxing training.’ It is not how Cullen would like to have progressed, but it is a good result for the Rock Star, who will now only have to win two matches to claim the Night 5 glory. The other semi-finals see Gary Anderson meet Michael Smith and Peter Wright play Jonny Clayton at The Brighton Centre. Price was also due to be the number one seed at the German Darts Championship in Hildesheim this weekend, but will not compete.
