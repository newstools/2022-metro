Nick Grimshaw surprised his followers with news that he’s engaged to longtime partner Meshach ‘Mesh’ Henry. The couple have been dating for four years and the former BBC Radio 1 presenter announced on Thursday that Mesh had proposed. Of course, Nick, 37, said yes and flashed his gold engagement ring in a series of Instagram photos. It’s not known exactly how the proposal went down but the presenter did an impromptu photo shoot on a beach with his ring and the sunset in the backdrop. He also shared photo booth snaps of him and Mesh together after he popped the question. ‘And in gay news this evening….got proposed to, said yes obvs,’ Nick captioned the Instagram post. Nick’s fleet of celebrity pals rushed to congratulate the happy couple, with Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo commenting: ‘Bring on the wedding of the century!!!!!!!’ Love Island presenter Laura Whitmore said: ‘Ahhhhhhhh CONGRATS!!! So delighted for ya! And we can all celebrate by watching you on celeb juice tonight! Big love to you both ❤️xx.’ Former Towie star Gemma Collins commented: ‘Absolutely fabulous 💕 congratulations x.’ Nick’s longtime pal Rita Ora simply wrote: ‘Heaven ❤️🙌’ while fellow pop star Dua Lipa said: ‘LOVE!!!!!!!!!!! TV presenter Stacey Dooley chimed in: ‘Beautiful news!!! 💚’ Jude Law’s son Rafferty Law added: ‘Nooooo way!! Ahhh this is the best news. Love you both x.’ Celebrity Juice star Emily Atack cheered: ‘THIS IS BLOODY WONDERFUL NEWS!!!!!!’ Radio 1 presenter Charlie Hedges commented: ‘Huge CONGRATULATIONS xx.’ The couple have been dating since 2018 and live together in North London. Mesh made the final of the BBC Young Dancer competition and is now a star at Rambert, one of the leading independent dance companies. A source previously told The Sun of their relationship after moving in: ‘Nick is the happiest he has ever been and Mesh is a massive part of that. ‘They were spending all of their time together, with Mesh always staying over, so it made complete sense for them to move in together. ‘Nick asked him to come and live with him and it’s all gone really well. Their jobs aren’t regular nine to fives so they can spend a lot of time together in the week.’ Got a story?
