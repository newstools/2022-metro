The Russian TV editor who denounced the invasion of Ukraine live on air has been labelled a ‘British spy’ and a traitor by her employer. Marina Ovsyannikova, who worked on Channel One, a mouthpiece for Vladimir Putin’s regime, bravely broke ranks by staging a protest in the studio. She ran behind a news presenter holding a poster reading ‘Stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here’, on March 14. She was quickly hustled away and Channel One offered no explanation until yesterday, claiming she was following the orders of the British embassy in Moscow. ‘She betrayed her country and all of us, coldly, duplicitously, for a bonus,’ head of news Kirill Kleimyonov told viewers. ‘Treason is always someone’s personal choice but you need to call things like they are. ‘If they had called the well-known deed in exchange for 30 pieces of silver an act of passion, world history would have gone very differently.’ Ms Ovsyannikova’s actions were branded ‘hooliganism’ by the Kremlin and she was fined for a separate video in which she called the invasion of Ukraine a crime. She could face 15 years in jail if prosecuted for her poster protest under a newly passed law punishing ‘public dissemination of false information’ The 43-year-old journalist told the BBC: ‘Nobody believed it was my personal decision.’ Ms Ovsyannikova said she was inspired to stage her protest because she felt state media and Kremlin propaganda had left people in Russia ‘zombified’. Harrowing images from Ukraine also jolted her own memories of growing up in Chechnya, a region torn apart by war after the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. The mum-of-two said she had initially supported president Putin, but had grown disillusioned with his leadership. Even though she hasn’t been locked up yet, Ms Ovsyannikova says she is ‘extremely concerned’ for her safety. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
