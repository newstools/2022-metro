Shocking pictures show a huge fire turning the night sky orange as it rips through Marsden Moor. Firefighters said they were battling two lines of fire, each measuring a mile long, on the moor near Huddersfield. It is the second fire to erupt in the area in a matter of days, prompting a reminder that fires, barbecues and fireworks are all banned on the moor. Around 60 firefighters were sent to the blaze after it broke yesterday afternoon and remained on the scene overnight. A previous fire erupted on Pule Hill last Friday. The National Trust manages the moor and issued a statement saying it is very ‘vulnerable to fires’ after a long period of dry weather.  ‘The fire risk is high during spring and summer,’ a spokesperson said. ‘If you see someone using a BBQ or a fire on the moor, call 999 and ask for FIRE.’ Anyone who starts a fire on the moors faces a fine and even a prison sentence.
