Harry Potter star Jessie Cave has shared a welcome update with fans as she battles Covid-19 in the third trimester of her pregnancy. The star, who’s best known for her role as Lavender Brown in the fantasy franchise, recently shared that Covid had hit her ‘like a tonne of bricks’ but she’s thankfully on the mend. Posting a video of all her supplies, and a much-needed slice of banana bread, Jessie, 34, wrote on Instagram: ‘Thank you for the well wishes and messages… ‘I’m actually okay, just weak and not myself and it’s not ideal timing obviously. I think my body is still recovering from covid & norovirus back to back…. ‘And now anaemia. I’ve done lots of research and had lots of advice and, most importantly, been to Holland & Barrett. BUT as always banana bread is the best remedy. ‘Also – yes I’m fully vaccinated and I’m glad I was.’ Jessie previously revealed she’d tested positive by sharing a photo of herself in hospital and writing: ‘Triage, once again…… ‘Anyone else had covid in 3rd trimester & had it hit them like a tonne of bricks for weeks?’ Jessie announced her pregnancy news last December, posting the first photo of her baby bump. The actress told followers at the time: ‘Can’t hide this new baby anymore.’ She also shares children Donnie and Margot, with her partner Alfie Brown, last year, with the couple adding to their brood with little Tenn in 2020. The tot was born in October and was originally named Abraham ‘Bam’ before the couple announced that they had changed his name to Tenn shortly after. Got a story?
