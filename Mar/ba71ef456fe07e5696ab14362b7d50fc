Children are having to be taught vital communications skills including how to talk and play after being kept apart during the pandemic. More than two-thirds of primary schools across England have signed up for language support to help their youngest pupils, who missed out on key events like birthday parties and playdates because of Covid lockdowns. The help, offered by the Nuffield Foundation with government support, is being expanded to meet demand. A survey last May showed three in five early years workers had found that more children than usual were failing to reach expected levels of development. Children and families minister Will Quince said: ‘Language is key to a child’s development and we know that for many children the pandemic meant they missed out on important early social interactions.’ About 90,000 reception-age children have received help from Nuffield’s early language intervention programme (NELI) since August 2020. Pupils taking part have made three months of additional progress on average compared with peers who are not involved. The sessions – now being provided to 11,000 schools – are delivered over 20 weeks with trained teachers providing scripted support. Lessons feature a puppet called Ted to help pupils concentrate on speaking and listening. Josh Hillman, of the foundation, said: ‘The fact that two-thirds of primary schools have arranged to receive NELI shows the value of access to an intervention that has been proven to work.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
