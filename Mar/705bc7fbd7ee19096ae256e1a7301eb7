We love to pamper our pets in this country, with 87% of British owners admitting that their pet gets spoiled regularly. The same survey by Hammonds also revealed that around half of us let our furry friends sit on sofas and living room chairs. But what if there was a better way to know your pet was comfy while keeping your soft furnishings free from hair and fluff? Aldi’s pet beds were sell-outs for that very reason back when they first launched, offering chic lounging options for discerning dogs and cats – and now they’re back. Designed to look like modern furniture in mini sizes, the range includes a scalloped chair and a longer sofa bed, both in velvet. Each bed has raised legs to keep it aired out and reduce smells, and the cushion covers of the pooch-perfect velour sofa can be washed in the machine too. In cool grey, rich royal blue, and emerald green colourways, there’s something to suit every home. That said, the beds are made for smaller dogs and cats rather than larger breeds – so not this lad, unfortunately. Mini sofas for pets aren’t a new concept, but Aldi’s offerings are some of the cheapest around. The sofa beds come in at £39.99 each, while the scalloped chairs are £44.99 each. For comparison, similar options from Made start at £125, while Sofology’s upholstered dog sofas start at £399. No one needs to know you got your Lilliputian lounger at an equally tiny price – they’ll be too enamoured by your pet snuggling in style to care.
