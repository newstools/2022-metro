Arsene Wenger believes Mikel Arteta has got Arsenal on the right track but claims the club’s hierarchy have only now ‘invested a lot of money’ in the squad. The Gunners strengthened their push to finish fourth in the Premier League with a 2-0 victory over Leicester City on Sunday. The win puts Arsenal a point ahead of fifth-place Manchester United and the Gunners also have three games in hand over Ralf Rangnick’s side. Arteta was given major backing by Arsenal last summer as the club spent £142 million on new signings, including deals for Ben White, Martin Odegaard, Aaron Ramsdale, Takehiro Tomiyasu, Albert Sambi Lokonga and Nuno Tavares. And Wenger feels last summer was the first time an Arsenal manager has been allowed to spend heavily since they moved into the Emirates Stadium in 2006. Asked if Arteta has recaptured the spirit of Arsenal, Wenger told beIN Sports: ‘It looks like yes, I think so, yes. ‘We still have some way to go because we were dominating in England for some time. ‘I think all the ingredients are there. The club has invested a lot of money for the first time since we have built the stadium. ‘The team is stable now in the results, his leadership looks to be accepted by the players and there is a connection between him and the team. ‘So overall, what you see from outside is positive.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
