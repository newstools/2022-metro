Manchester United’s ‘season from hell’ will cost Cristiano Ronaldo £5million in earnings this season, with the 37-year-old set to earn roughly half of what he was taking home at Juventus during his first season back at Old Trafford. The Portugal captain made a heroic return to the Theatre of Dreams last summer, rejoining the club in a £12m move from Juventus. While Ronaldo has plundered a respectable 18 goals in 33 appearances this term, United have endured a campaign from hell. The Red Devils were knocked out of the FA Cup by Championship side Middlesbrough, West Ham in the League Cup and Atletico Madrid in the Champions League. Ronaldo agreed a heavily reduced basic salary when he rejoined the club, having been Juventus’ top earner on around £700,000-a-week. However, the striker could make up most of that deficit in bonuses should United progress deep into the cup competitions and win domestic silverware. Getting to the Champions League final, for example, would have earned Ronaldo around £1.5m. However, with United’s poor form seeing them knocked out of all competitions by mid-March, Ronaldo is set to take a £5m hit to his earnings according to the Sun. Ronaldo will consider his future at the end of the season, with the Portuguese forward minded to leave the club if they fail to reach the top four. United are currently outsiders, with Arsenal occupying the last spot in the top four with a two-game advantage.
