An escaped convict who went on the lam in his underwear has been arrested at gunpoint. Kyle Eglington reportedly burst out of a prison van on a residential street in Poole, Dorset, on Saturday morning. The 32-year-old allegedly fought his way past security guards and managed to get out of the vehicle. He absconded wearing only underpants and socks, Dorset Police earlier said. A spokesperson warned the public on Sunday that Eglington may have shaved his head and beard in a bid to change his appearance. Now the force has confirmed he has been detained by its armed policing unit. He was arrested on suspicion of assault and escaping lawful custody after a three-day manhunt. The National Police Air Service helicopter and the British Transport Police were also involved in the search. Dorset Police thanked the public for sharing its appeals to find Eglington.
