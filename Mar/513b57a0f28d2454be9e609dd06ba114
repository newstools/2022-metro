Manchester United midfielder Tahith Chong was robbed at knifepoint inside his own home. The 22-year-old, who has made 16 senior appearances for United, is currently on loan at Birmingham City in the Championship. According to The Sun, Chong was held at knifepoint inside his own home by three men in balaclavas. It’s claimed that Chong was ordered to hand over valuable items and was even mocked by the men about the poor security in his home. ‘It was an awful experience for him,’ a source told the newspaper. ‘He was woken to the sight of three armed men in balaclavas holding knives to his throat. ‘They also shone torches in his eyes and ordered him to get up and give them items, including watches. ‘It seemed like they knew what they were doing and what they were after. ‘They knew who the player was and were calling him by his name. ‘And they even told him that he really needed to improve his security or risked it happening again. ‘It’s chilling. He was left extremely shaken. ‘The gang were professional and seemed like they had done it before, possibly to other players.’ Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba revealed earlier this month that his house was targeted by thieves while his children were asleep in their bedrooms. Victor Lindelof’s house was also broken into in January whilst he played for United in their 3-1 win at Brentford. Chong, meanwhile, told fans he is ‘doing fine’ after the attack. ‘Good morning to everyone. Yesterday there was a report that came out as terrifying as the article may sound, I am doing fine and this was a few months back, so not as some reported last night,’ Chong posted on Instagram. ‘Thankyou for all the messages and happy Mother’s Day to everyone.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
