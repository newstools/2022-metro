Parties and events are back on. And for those looking to celebrate occasions in style, a brand new vessel will be offering exactly that very soon. A new £25million ‘superyacht’ will be sailing onto the Thames in a matter of months. Set to be London’s largest floating venue, Oceandiva will pop up in August ready for an autumn launch. With room for up to 1,500 guests, the lavish 86-metre-long yacht will host dinners, receptions and product launches. It will be stationed at the Royal Docks and attendees will be able to board at London Bridge, Canary Wharf, Greenwich, ExCel and Tower Bridge – depending on the event. While there are no real pictures as of yet, mock-ups for the sleek boat show a matte grey barge with a Union Jack hanging from the top deck, as well as a large outdoor decking space – spread across two levels. Oceandiva is a Dutch company that already has ships up and running in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. It says the London yacht will be a CO2-neutral venue, so it will be powered by lithium battery packs – backed up by mounted solar panels. The team add that the venue will be perfect for extravagant weddings, private cocktail parties, milestone birthdays and cultural celebrations. But this decadent party venue doesn’t come cheap. According to the Evening Standard, hire rates start from £27,000 a night – and the company is now taking bookings. Greg Lawson, chief executive of operators at events company Smart Group, said: ‘Oceandiva is leading the way to a net zero future for the events industry. ‘The project is the first of its kind in the world and where better to launch it than the world-beating city of London.’ Do you have a story to share?
