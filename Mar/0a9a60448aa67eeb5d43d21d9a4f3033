Ready for skin refresh? We’d all love a facial, especially one that costs £130 and has been done on Beyonce, Kate Winslet and Britney Spears previously. If it’s good enough for them, right. Well now, in an unusual offering, one facialist brand is offering anyone the chance to experience that for free. HydraFacial, which can be done at the London flagship on Portman Square or in over 900 Provider clinics across the country, is a non-invasive facial treatment that’s suitable for most skin types and concerns. To be in with a shot of getting a free treatment, you need to be new to HydraFacial and sign up here. Then periodically, anyone who signs up will get an email announcing that 750 free appointments are available to book – then it’s first come first served. There won’t just be one round of free appointments, as the brand has told Metro.co.uk this offering is ongoing. HydraFacial is keen to get people in to ‘try before they buy’, confident that it will result in return customers. Aimed at anyone looking for hydrated glowy skin, the treatment includes nourishing steps and a peel. First there is a cleanse and acid peel to aid with exfoliation, using glycolic and salicylic acids. Then pores are cleaned using a suction tool for light extraction, then moisture is added into the skin. Next antioxidants and peptides are used to protect skin and increase the glow. If required, special add-ons can be included to suit particular skin concerns. It’s A-listed approved, so you’ll just need to move quick. Do you have a story to share?
