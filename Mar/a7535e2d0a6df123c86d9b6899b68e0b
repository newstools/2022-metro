Amanda Holden is on a mission to ‘turn up the feel good’ and, we have to say, her World Book Day costume had done just that. The Britain’s Got Talent star, alongside her Heart Breakfast comrades Jamie Theakston and Ashley Roberts, took a leaf out of the tale of French chivalry by dressing as the Three Musketeers today. In her swashbuckling finest, Amanda wore a resplendent blue dress with thigh-high boots and an extravagant hat as she wielded a prop sword around the Heart studios. Published in 1844, The Three Musketeers is a French historical adventure novel written by Alexandre Dumas, which focuses on the heroic, chivalrous swordsmen who fight for justice. Right up Amanda’s alley. Asking what everyone else had dressed up as today, alongside a shot of the musketeers working their outfits, a post on the brand’s Twitter read: ‘It’s #WorldBookDay and our 3 musketeers are ready to turn up the feel good! 👏📚 ‘What have your little ones dressed up as today?’ The star also shared a photo of her younger daughter Hollie, 12, getting into the spirit, dressed as a pirate on the day of days. Amanda – who revealed this week her eldest daughter Lexi, 16, had signed to a top modelling agency – wasn’t the only celebrity getting into the World Book Day vibes, with Kate Ferdinand painting herself orange and bringing us the Oompa Loompa goodness on Thursday. Popping on a green wig, she shared a photo alongside her young son with Rio Ferdinand, Cree, who was dresses as Woody from toy Story. She wrote: ‘You’ve got a friend in me 🥺❤️…. World Book Day 📚’ While Kerry Katona’s youngest daughter Dylan-Jorge, seven, chose a Harry Potter costume for the celebrations, Christine McGuinness also shared her pride on one of the first World Book Days her three children – eight year-old twins Leo and Penelope, and Felicity, five, who have all have autism – enjoyed dressing up. In a heartwarming post, she wrote: ‘My heart just smiled. This morning I have a very happy ‘Jessie’ from toy story, a beautiful ‘Snow white’ and fabulous ‘Super Mario’ for #WorldBookDay. ‘I remember when my children would never dress up because the costumes where too itchy, (I still have to put soft layers underneath) but they wouldn’t even touch the fabric! ‘And just seeing other children wearing costumes would totally confuse and upset them. Now they understand, we prepare and they enjoy World book day.’ MORE : Amanda Holden celebrates 51st birthday with raucous party and cake modelled on her own cleavage MORE : Amanda Holden, Caroline Flack and Liam Gallagher among stars in powerful eyes closed portraits for mental health awareness: ‘In some ways, you can see more clearly with your eyes shut’ Got a story?
