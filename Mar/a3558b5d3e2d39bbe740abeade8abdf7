Not even war can stop love. Despite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, those defending the country still are finding opportunities to solidify their romantic relationships through the act of marriage. Yesterday, moving pictures emerged of a couple, named Oleksandr and Olena, marrying at a checkpoint in an unknown location in Ukraine. Both are National Guards, who married in their uniform outside with a few witnesses in attendance, plus a priest who performed the ceremony. At such a turbulent and troublesome time, images like these are a hopeful reminder that connection and love can trump the obstacles. The couple can be seen with flowers and a cake as they celebrate surrounded by the giveaways of a country under attack. Only a few days before another Ukrainian couple – both of which work in territorial defense – got married in uniform. Lesya and Valeriy married, seemingly without any family present. Other soldiers were involved as they played instruments like flutes while the couple were serenaded. The bride could be seen holding a champagne flute while swapping her helmet briefly for a veil. Their nuptials took place near Kyiv. The video has been viewed over a million times, as they celebrate near the frontline. Do you have a story to share?
