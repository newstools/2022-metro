A new fast-food chain could be about to launch in Russia – with a logo strikingly similar to its famous American predecessor. All 847 McDonald’s restaurants were shut in solidarity with those suffering in Ukraine. Bosses said the closures were necessary due to the ‘needless human suffering’ caused by Russia. The shutdown led to huge tailbacks in Moscow on the final days of operation, while some even stockpiled burgers to prepare for life without Maccies. But now, the golden arches seem to have re-appeared – just horizontally. A trademark has been registrated by Russkoye Polye-Logistik LLC for a new brand called ‘Uncle Vanya’. Its golden logo and red background were noted almost immediately by online critics. One Twitter user said: ‘I would like to try a Putin McMuffin or a Big Stalin Mac or a Borscht Milkshake.’ Another added: ‘The Russian population will never buy this. ‘Everyone knows, once you’ve had Mac, you can’t go back.’ Russia’s State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin told parliament the Uncle Vanya franchise should replace the shut McDonald’s stores. The Independent reports the city council have awarded 500m rubles (£3.6m) to domestic fast food chains. McDonald’s have been contacted for comment by Metro.co.uk. McDonald’s was the first American fast food restaurant to open in the Soviet Union. In the years since, Russians have grown attached to the golden arches, and some took the recent closures to heart. Pianist Luka Safronov chained himself outside a McDonald’s in Pushkin Square, Moscow on Monday. He was taken away by police officers after the stunt. McDonald’s said in a statement that ‘it’s impossible to predict when we might be able to reopen our restaurants in Russia.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
