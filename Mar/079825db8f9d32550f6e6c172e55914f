We’re used to seeing the occasional dog pop its head out of a car window every now and then. It can be pretty endearing to see a pet’s ears flapping and tongue lolloping in the wind, but it’s not an unusual sight. What is more strange however is… an alpaca sticking its head out of a car window. Yes, you did read that correctly. Kirsty Shilliday, 38, was casually cruising along in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, near Glasgow, when she saw an animal poking its head out of a window. The hairdresser initially thought it was a large dog – but when the black Vauxhall Zafira stopped at a red light, she got a closer look. Turns out it wasn’t a dog, but a fluffy alpaca. Video footage shows the animal sticking its long brown neck through the gap in the window as its head towers above the roof of the vehicle. Just as the car starts to move away, the alpaca retracts its neck back inside but still seems to be looking out of the window. Kirsty posted the clip on TikTok on Saturday, writing: ‘Meanwhile in Airdrie.’ One person commented: ‘To be fair, that’s not the weirdest thing I’ve seen in Airdrie or Coatbridge.’ One social media user claimed the same alpaca paid a visit to a local school that day. They said: ‘It was in my daughter’s high school this afternoon, they brought it to Coatbridge High for a visit.’ Alpacas are distinguished from llamas by their significantly shorter ears. They tend to be much smaller than llamas, and also have shorter, blunter faces. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
