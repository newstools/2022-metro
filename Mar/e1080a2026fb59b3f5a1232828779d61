Peter Andre has displayed his bruised and bloodied face as he teases a new ‘secret project’ with his followers on social media. The singer and star, 49, revealed his gruesome new look wasn’t the result of a drunken night on the tiles, but was in fact down to a talented makeup artist. In the photographs, he appeared to have taken a beating for the new role, as he sported a bloodied and broken nose alongside a deeply bruised cheek. Peter didn’t give much away in the explanation to the post, writing: ‘Ouch!! #secretproject #comingsoon @therealfredinwaka.’ Elsewhere, film director, producer, actor and motivational speaker Fredi Nkwaka shared his own image of Peter, as the pair both held their fingers on tightly sealed lips. He captioned the photograph: ‘OUCH!!! I Don’t wanna say too much….Shouts to @jessicas_beautique_ for this one.’ Fredi then got fans excited for the project, as he added the hashtags ‘independent film’ and ‘secret project’. His followers were quick to comment as one penned: ‘Well that looks like it stung a tad! 🙌🏻🙌🏻’ Another expressed their excitement: ‘I want to scream, WOW, this is so exciting! 🥳😍💖💖💖🙌’ Meanwhile, Peter and his son Junior spoke of their emotional reunion with the star’s unwell mother and family, as they appeared on Good Morning Britain earlier this month. Speaking to Kate Garraway and Ben Shepherd, the Mysterious Girl singer said: ‘These last few days for us have just been the best days we’ve had in many years. ‘Seeing my sister, seeing my mum and my dad is incredible. It really is.’ He added: ‘Our mum’s not very well. Dad’s 89, he’s still rocking, dad is, but mum’s, she’s suffering quite a bit. ‘So we’re all here together. It means a lot to us to be able to have this time with mum. For us it’s amazing.’ Junior, 16, who the singer shares with ex-wife Katie Price, said that his father had been ‘very emotional’ and with ‘tears everywhere’ following the reunion. The pair were joined by two of Peter’s siblings, Michael and Debbie, as presenter Ben Shephard asked Junior: ‘ ‘Who was the most emotional?’ In response, Junior said: ‘Dad is a very emotional guy, there were tears everywhere, to be honest. Even I was emotional. I hadn’t seen them for a very long time, it has been amazing.’ Junior added: ‘I asked my Yia Yia (grandmother) if she wants water every five minutes, and you kiss her every five minutes. I love them so much, it’s good that we have seen them. There were emotional tears everywhere.’ MORE : Kanye West defended by The Game over ‘Grammys ban’ and Instagram suspension MORE : Trevor Noah responds after Kanye West banned from Grammys: ‘I said counsel Kanye not cancel’
