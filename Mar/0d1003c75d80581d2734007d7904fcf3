Gogglebox star Ellie Warner’s boyfriend Nat Eddleston is reportedly ‘fighting for his life’ after being hit by a car. Nat is said to be in intensive care on a life support machine with a broken neck and collapsed lungs. A family member told The Sun: ‘Nat is in intensive care with a broken neck, broken back, two collapsed lungs and possible brain damage. ‘He is on a life support machine and all the family and Ellie are obviously very worried for him.’ The outlet reports that Nat, who had been enjoying a night in the pub with his friends, was hit by a white Seat Leon travelling out of the city just after midnight. The car, which is said to have sustained damage to the windscreen, and the roof, reportedly continued for about 100 yards before stopping. Police are said to be looking for witnesses. Leeds-based Ellie, 31, who is also a hair stylist, and her sister Izzi, 27, have starred on Gogglebox since 2015. Nat has appeared various times alongside Ellie. Ellie has not yet addressed the reported incident. Gogglebox first started in 2013, with Ellie and Izzi joining two years later. Metro.co.uk has contacted reps for Ellie Warner and West Yorkshire Police for comment.
