This is the moment that an alleged looter was publicly humiliated for trying to raid a petrol station during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Thinking his crimes would go unnoticed because of the war, he was tied to a lamppost in front of the petrol station in Kyiv with his trousers pulled down to his knees. A man appeared to stop and berate him for taking advantage of the chaos of the war. Many supermarkets, banks and petrol stations have been targeted by burglars since the invasion began two weeks ago. However, there have been many cases where alleged perpetrators have stopped and humiliated by witnesses. Being tied to lampposts is a popular punishment, along with cardboard signs detailing why they have been left in such a position. In more sinister forms of vigilantism, some have been forced to strip naked and beaten. Russian soldiers have also allegedly been looting from shops, desperate because their rations expired in 2015. The besieged city of Mariupol was short on water, food and power, and cellphone networks are down. Stores have been looted as residents search for essential goods. Police moved through the city, advising people to remain in shelters until they heard official messages broadcast over loudspeakers to evacuate. Hospitals in Mariupol are facing severe shortages of antibiotics and painkillers, and doctors performed some emergency procedures without them. The lack of phone service left anxious citizens approaching strangers to ask if they knew relatives living in other parts of the city and whether they were safe.
