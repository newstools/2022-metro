Novak Djokovic has confirmed he will not be playing in the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells and the Miami Open due to Covid vaccination rules. The Serbian, who remains unvaccinated, is not permitted to enter the United States. While he was initially included in the draw for both competitions, the 20-time Grand Slam winner has confirmed on social media he will not feature. Djokovic said on Instagram: ‘While I was automatically listed in the @bnpparibasopen and @miamiopen draw, I knew, given the entry requirements to the US, it would be unlikely I’d be able to travel there. ‘But as international COVID regulations are always being amended, I wanted to wait and see if anything would change. ‘The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) confirmed today that regulations are not changing which means I will not be playing in the US.’ Djokovic’s vaccination status dominated the weeks leading into the Australian Open in January with the 34-year-old deported from the country after his visa was twice cancelled following his arrival on a medical exemption. He revealed last month that he had not received any coronavirus vaccination, insisting he would forego big tournaments ‘because the principles of decision-making on my body are more important than any title or anything else’. Djokovic played his first tournament of the year in Dubai a fortnight ago and was overtaken as world No.1 by Daniil Medvedev last week.
