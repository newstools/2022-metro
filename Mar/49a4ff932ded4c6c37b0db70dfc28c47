Winds of up to 70mph will tear through Britain this weekend before balmy weather returns. Many enjoyed long-overdue sunshine yesterday as temperatures were warmer in the UK than in Athens. But there will be a drop in the mercury once again tomorrow. The Met Office predicts an ‘energetic weather pattern’ will bring wet weather and strong gales with it. There will be blustery winds this evening as cloudy skies gather and rain falls overnight. Saturday will be dry during the day, until rain returns by late afternoon. The downpour is predicted to be the heaviest in the South West of England, while 70mph gales will swoop down the west coast of Britain. The Isles of Scilly and Cornwall face the strongest winds. Met Office chief meteorologist Neil Armstrong told Metro.co.uk: ‘An energetic, mobile weather pattern is driving successive low-pressure systems across the Atlantic over the coming days. ‘With high pressure to the east of the UK these systems stall and weaken as they reach us and bring spells of rain and wind together with milder air. ‘At this time no National Severe Weather warnings have been issued, however, that situation may change over the coming days so keep an eye on the forecast for your area.’ A yellow warning is in place for Devon and Cornwall on Saturday with risks of some travel disruption. The warning extends to Wales, Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland on Sunday. Bad weather will clear on Monday when ‘more settled’ weather conditions are expected to return. Temperatures could even reach a balmy 18°C degrees as the week progresses. While March may have felt extra chilly for some, temperatures are on par with previous years. Forecasters have not ruled out further snow or frost – and have urged people to keep a close eye on their local weather forecasts.
