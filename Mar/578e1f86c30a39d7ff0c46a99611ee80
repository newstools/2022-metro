A mountain of ‘stolen bikes’ that was so big it could be seen from Google Earth has been discovered in Oxford. The stash of bicycles was found in the back garden of a house in Littlemore, to the southeast of the university city. When police raided the house they discovered the backyard was full of hundreds of bicycles piled on top of one another. A 54-year-old man living in the house was arrested on suspicion of handling stolen goods and possession of the criminal property. He has since been released under investigation. Neighbours reported seeing police sorting through the mountain of bikes and officers are now understood to be in the process of locating their owners. Google Earth Images of the street show a dark mass covering the semi-detached property’s garden. As images of the find were shared on social media people asked how the mammoth stash had not been spotted earlier. One said: ‘Cracks me up no one spotted it sooner. Surely you’d think it suspicious to have a garden overflowing with bikes?’ Many agreed with this sentiment, wondering ‘Did the neighbours not think it strange…?’ ‘What they got, 222 Kids and Counting lol?’ Others revealed the bikes have ‘been there for years’. Anyone with any information about the bikes is asked to contact Thames Valley Police on 101. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
