Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear plant has lost power just hours after it was switched back on. The decommissioned plant – the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster – was seized by Russian forces in the first few days of the invasion. It soon lost power after the plant’s high-voltage power line was damaged in the fighting. Energy officials confirmed the electricity supply was restored yesterday, but it didn’t last long and cut out this morning. Grid operator Ukrenergo blamed Russian troops for damaging the power line for the second time and demanded access to carry out repairs. It did not say if all external power supply to the plant had been lost as a result. There are fears that radioactive substances could be released if the power line is not urgently repaired. The lack of power means the cooling systems are not operating normally and are relying on backup electricity. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency has played down concerns over the safety of Chernobyl’s nuclear waste, saying its cooling ponds are large enough to keep the spent fuel in a safe condition even if the power supply is interrupted. Russia has targeted Ukraine’s power plants ever since Putin’s troops entered the country nearly three weeks ago. Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said ten Russian officials, including two engineers, unsuccessfully attempted to enter Zaporizhzhia and take control of operations. ‘There are around 500 Russian soldiers with automatic weapons … our staff are in an extremely bad psychological state,’ Energoatom chief Petro Kotin said.
