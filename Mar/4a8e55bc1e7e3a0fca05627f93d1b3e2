A couple from Devon managed to keep their cool in an extremely hot situation. Jane and Rich Dickinson were driving through Dartmoor when their journey took a turn for the worse yesterday. Filming from her passenger seat, Jane captured a raging wildfire as it stalked their car, sending enormous flames into the sky. Thick black smoke and the evening light made it near impossible for Rich to see the white dividing lines on the road. But the Dickinsons stayed remarkably calm as their car past the fire – in what has been described as a ‘very British’ reaction. Jane uttered several expletives and quickly urged her husband to ‘go go go’ but the pair soon shared a laugh after the smoke subsided on the road. ‘Bloody hell, I felt the heat off that,’ Jane said as smoke seeps into the car. She added: ‘I didn’t expect that.’ Jane posted on Facebook: ‘Never had to drive through a wildfire before! ‘Edge of Dartmoor, one minute driving towards it, the next we couldn’t see a thing but really felt the heat from the flames against the car and the smoke started to come in through the vents. ‘Not one to repeat! Well done Rich for keeping cool.’ She added: ‘Luckily nothing hit us from the oncoming or following cars. Not something I ever want to repeat.’ The fire was branded a ‘major incident’ by the emergency services who were scrambled to the scene at Mary Tavy and Tungsten West Mine. At one point, the fire had reached 750-metres in length. Firefighters were concerned for the safety of deer and the blaze potentially spreading onto the A386. People were urged to stay away from the wildfire but it was eventually extinguished soon after 10pm. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
