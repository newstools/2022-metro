A same-sex couple were subjected to a barrage of homophobic abuse from a gang of teenagers on a late-night bus in Cheltenham. Daniel McDonnell and Giles Norton were targeted by a group of four or five teenagers last weekend. Gloucestershire Police think the couple, who had been to a drag event in the town that night, were targeted because Mr McDonnell was dressed in drag. The pair were abused by the youths on the top deck of the No 10 bus as it travelled towards Gloucester last Saturday, March 12. The driver became aware of what was happening and stopped on Shurdington Road so the two could get off. The group, who made various comments towards the couple, were described as all being white males in their late teens, one of them was wearing a black sweatshirt. Police said the incident is being treated as a hate crime. PC Steph Lawrence, county hate crime co-ordinator, said: ‘Gloucestershire is a welcoming, friendly and diverse county and we will not tolerate hate in any of its forms. ‘We will work hard to address it, with the help of our partner agencies across the county. ‘As a force we have a four-year strategic plan in place to tackle hate, we encourage all victims of these crimes to come forward and report either to us, or Gloucestershire Victim Support. ‘We also encourage people not to be bystanders and report on behalf of others.’ Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident to get in touch and CCTV enquiries are ongoing to identify those involved.
