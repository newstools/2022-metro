A Yorkshire couple have travelled across Britain on a quest to visit as many Wetherspoons pubs as possible. They’ve bagged 321 so far, and have no plans of slowing down. Phil and Julie Fox say their unique hobby comes from their shared love for geography, beer and value-for-money grub. Phil, 74, acknowledges that it may seem like an odd enjoyment to some. He told Yorkshire Live: ‘I think our family just accept that we have a strange but good hobby. ‘When we go anywhere they love the fact that seven or eight of us, including grandchildren, can eat for less than £50.’ The couple hit their latest milestone on Tuesday when they popped in for a pint at the Globe Hotel in Norfolk. Their very first Spoons visit was back in 2004 in Richmond, North Yorkshire. The grandparents plan to visit London this summer and tick off a few new spots during the trip. Phil added: ‘We just enjoy bagging ‘Spoons, visiting bits of England we’ve never been to.’ Their favourites include The Imperial in Exeter, a former hotel with a barrel-vaulted conservatory space. They were also impressed with The Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, a former courthouse and police station in Cumbria, and also highlighted the sea views of The Admiral Collingwood in Ilfracombe, Devon. Phil added that one or two ‘Spoons pubs have been a bit on the ‘rough’ side, including one near Rochdale. He said: ‘We had to shout over women using the “F” word. ‘We sat right at the back.’ The couple’s final goal, once they’ve ticked off as many Wetherspoons as they can, is to see their story told in the pub’s in-house magazine.
