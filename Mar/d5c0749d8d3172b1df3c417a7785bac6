For children fleeing war-torn Ukraine, starting school in an unfamiliar country, where there are language and cultural differences, is likely to be a tough experience. This is why more than 200 students and their teachers at a school in Italy gathered to greet two new pupils named locally as siblings Dmitri, 10, and Victoria, 8. A video shared on Twitter shows rows of boys and girls in the Don Milani institute in Naples erupting in applause as their new classmates arrived for their first day. Hoping to bring a smile on their faces and make them feel welcomed, some children were even waving the national blue and yellow flag of Ukraine. Two boys were seen stepping forward to personally greet Dmitri and Victoria, while some teachers filmed the special moment, the Daily Mail reports. More than 2.8 million people have now fled Ukraine in the last 19 days because of Vladimir Putin’s invasion, according to the United Nations (UN). Poland has welcomed nearly 1.8 million, followed by Hungary with 255,291, Slovakia with 204,862, and Moldova with 106,994. Some 35,000 refugees have also entered Italy, most of them through its northeastern border with Slovenia. Earlier today, Ukraine’s prime minister Denys Shmyhal praised European countries for opening their borders and looking after refugees. ‘Grateful to Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Lithuania and many other European countries for the support, hospitality, warm attitude and attention provided to Ukrainian women and children’, the politician said. ‘It’s urgent to stop the aggressor so that Ukrainians can return back home!’ The video from the Don Milani institute drew in a lot of praise, with some social media users naming it ‘amazing’. However, others users insisted the big welcome could have made the children uncomfortable. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
