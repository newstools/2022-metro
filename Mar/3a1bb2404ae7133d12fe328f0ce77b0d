History was made at the Camp Nou on Wednesday night as a crowd of 91,553 people watched Barcelona Women beat Real Madrid Women 5-2 – the attendance ever for a women’s football match. The enormous crowd were watching the second lef of the Champions League quarter-final between the two giant Spanish clubs and they were far from disappointed. Barca were 3-1 up from the first leg and goals from Carolina Graham Hansen, Mapi León, Aitana Bonmati, Claudia Pina and Alexia Putellas secured the huge win in front of the mammoth crowd. ‘I’m almost speechless, honestly,’ Putellas said. ‘The fans didn’t want to go home. There was such a connection between them and us while we celebrated. To hear them singing that they want to go to Turin was superb.’ The clash in Spain beat the previous record for any women’s match, which was previously held by the USA vs China game in the 1999 World Cup at the Rose Bowl, Pasadena. The game absolutely smashed the previous record for a women’s club match, which was set in 2019 when Barcelona took on Atletico Madrid at the Wanda Metropolitano and 60,739 were in attendance. Third on that particular list was set in 1920 at Goodison Park when 53,000 watched Dick, Kerr Ladies play St Helens Ladies. Barcelona surge into the semi-finals where they will play either Arsenal or Wolfsburg.
