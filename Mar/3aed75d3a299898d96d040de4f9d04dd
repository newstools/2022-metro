Doja Cat has issued a scathing message on social media, claiming she’s ‘quitting music’ after backlash from fans in Paraguay. The Say So hitmaker was forced to cancel her show in Paraguay due to storms, shortly after Miley Cyrus reassured fans she was alright after her plane was struck by lightning on her way to her show there. Some fans had seemingly complained about standing out in the rain wanting to meet the star, with Doja – real name Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini – hitting back. ‘I don’t give a f**k anymore i f**kin quit i can’t wait to f**king disappear and i don’t need you to believe in me anymore,’ she said. ‘Everything is dead to me, music is dead, and i’m a f**king fool for ever thinking i was made for this this is a f**king nightmare unfollow me.’ Doja, 26, also changed her name on Twitter to ‘i quit’ and tweeted: ‘This s**t ain’t for me so I’m out. Y’all take care.’ On Instagram, she also shared a screenshot of her horoscope, which said she would face ‘unexpected opposition’. Doja and Miley were among the artists who were forced to cancel shows in Paraguay, with Machine Gun Kelly also having to cancel a performance. MGK – real name Colson Baker – instead decided to perform outside his hotel, tweeting: ‘The concert grounds flooded in paraguay tonight so they cancelled our set…but i just ordered a huge speaker so meet me out front of my hotel right now, youre getting a show.’ Doja has had a tough time of it recently after she was forced to pull out of performing at the Brit Awards when several of her crew members tested positive for Covid-19. She wrote in a statement: ‘Unfortunately, due to cases of Covid within my crew, I will no longer be performing at the Brits. ‘It’s simply not safe for us to continue to rehearse together and put each other in harm’s way. I can’t wait to perform for my UK fans as soon as I can. Take care of yourselves.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted reps for Doja Cat for comment. Got a story?
