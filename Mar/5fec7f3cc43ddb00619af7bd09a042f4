An urgent appeal has been launched to find the family of a man who is critically ill in hospital. The unidentified man was behaving erratically, approaching people in Green Lanes West, north London, and grabbing them. He was detained under the Mental Health Act and rushed to hospital by paramedics who alerted the police. Scotland Yard said he was not arrested, adding their officers ‘did not use force’ to detain him. He was unable to provide his name to staff and does not possess any identification. The man was left in the care of doctors but he was taken seriously unwell the next day following a medical episode. He remains in hospital in critical condition. Efforts to identify the man have so far been unsuccessful and police are now asking the public for help to name him so his next of kin can be informed. Anyone who can help is asked to call the Met on 101. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
