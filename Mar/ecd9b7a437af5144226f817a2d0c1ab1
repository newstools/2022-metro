Brenda Edwards has posted a collage of family photos of her late son Jamal Edwards on Mother’s Day following his death last month. Music entrepreneur Edwards, who gained fame after setting up the new music platform SBTV in 2006, died suddenly in February aged 31. Loose Women presenter Brenda marked this year’s Mother’s Day by sharing nine pictures of her son and daughter Tanisha. The images were taken through the ages, with one showing Edwards as a young boy sat with this little sister on his lap. Another saw Brenda as a young mother with her arms wrapped around her two children. ‘Always and Forever. 💙,’ she captioned the post. Brenda’s loved ones were quick to rally around her and sent her kind comments of love and support. DJ Sarah Jane Crawford wrote: ‘Sending all the love ❤️’ Blue singer Duncan James sent several love heart emojis, while a fan wrote: ‘Been thinking about you.’ Brenda paid an emotional tribute to her late son last month in a statement shared with Good Morning Britain. ‘It is with the deepest heartache that I can confirm that my beautiful son Jamal Edwards passed away yesterday morning after a sudden illness,’ she said at the time. ‘Myself, his sister Tanisha and the rest of his family and friends are completely devastated. He was the centre of our world.’ She continued: ‘As we come to terms with his passing we ask for privacy to grieve this unimaginable loss. I would like to thank everyone for their messages of love and support. ‘Jamal was an inspiration to myself and so many. Our love for him lives on, his legacy lives on. Long live Jamal Edwards MBE, MBA, PHD.’ Edwards gained fame from setting up the new music platform SBTV, which helped to launch a string of UK music careers including Dave and Jessie J. He was an ambassador for the Prince’s Trust, a charity headed by the Prince of Wales, and in 2014 he was awarded an MBE for his services to music. Got a story?
