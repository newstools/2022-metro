A Ukrainian peace negotiator has reportedly been executed following claims he was a Russian spy. Denis Kireev was pictured sitting on the Ukrainian side of the negotiating table during peace talks with Russia on February 28 — despite not being on the official delegation list. His role at the summit is unclear and his death is now shrouded in mystery, with both Russia and Ukraine making contradictory claims. MPs said the former banker, 45, was shot and killed by Ukraine’s security service after resisting arrest on suspicion of ‘treason’.

Pictures were posted online yesterday allegedly showing him dead before rumours that he was spying for Russia began circulating. Russia meanwhile claimed he was killed by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), while senior Ukrainian politicians said he died in SBU detention. In a statement, Ukraine’s ministry of defence said: ‘During the execution of special tasks, three spies were killed — employees of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.’ It named Mr Kireev, Alexei Ivanovich and Chibineev Valery Viktorovich. The statement added: ‘They perished defending Ukraine, and their rank brought us closer to victory! ‘We express our sincere condolences to the families of the victims.’ It signed off: ‘Glory to heroes!’ Russian newspaper Pravda reported that Ukraine had ‘clear evidence’ of Mr Kireev’s suspected treason, which is said to have included telephone conversations.
