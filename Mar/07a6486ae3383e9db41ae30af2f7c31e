What would you expect from a flat that sits above a takeaway in north London? Maybe a couple of bedrooms? An average sized living space? Maybe the scent of frying grease from the establishment below? Well, one unassuming flat that is situated above a Chinese takeaway on Hornsey Road in Archway, will blow all of those expectations out of the water. And as it’s on the market for a cool £850,000 would would expect it to. The surprising two-bedroom flat comes with a couple of hidden secrets that might make it more worth the price tag. Spaced over two floors, with 1,271 square foot in space, the apartment has neutral decor and high ceilings. But the real fun comes downstairs on the lower ground floor – which is home to a rather unique addition. Accessed by a spiral staircase is an incredible indoor swimming pool, alongside a sauna and steam room. Meanwhile back upstairs, the property benefits from an open-plan reception and kitchen on the ground floor, which comes with plenty of space and storage. The reception combined kitchen also features glass doors that take you onto the long, private patio space, which can also be accessed by both bedrooms. The abode comes with a main double bedroom, which features a walk-in wardrobe, a second bedroom and a modern bathroom. This property is listed by Foxtons for £850,000. Do you have a story to share?
