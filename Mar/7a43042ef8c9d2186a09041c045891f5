Naomi Campbell blessed her fans with rare photos of her baby daughter to mark her first Mother’s Day. The supermodel, 51, welcomed her first child in May 2021 after keeping the news that she was having a baby private. Since then, she’s kept her daughter mostly out of the public eye but shared a special insight into her life as a mother on Sunday. In one Instagram photo, Naomi is seen carrying her small child in a park and gently kissing her on the cheek while the youngster looks off into the distance inquisitively. It’s clear her daughter has inherited the model’s fashion sense as the little one looked trendy, dressed in a green plaid dress with emerald shoes and a tiny cardigan. The runway queen also acknowledged her own beloved mother in the post, and included a photo of Valerie smiling at her grandchild during a bonding moment at home. ‘1st Mothers Day UK 🇬🇧 Gods Greatest Blessing !! #happymothersday #blessed #grateful ❤️🙏🏾,’ Naomi captioned the post. Her close friend and British Vogue editor Edward Enninful commented: ‘Happy Mother’s Day ‘Omi.. what a blessing ❤️’ Actress Liberty Ross commented: ‘Congrats ❤️’ Naomi’s little one made her official public debut in February when the pair posed together on the cover of British Vogue. In the accompanying interview, the model addressed the circumstances around her child’s conception and stated: ‘She wasn’t adopted – she’s my child.’ She also admitted that she could ‘count on one hand the number of people who knew that I was having her’. ‘But she is the biggest blessing I could ever imagine,’ she continued. ‘It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.’ Naomi also gave an insight into her daughter’s temperament, revealing that she’s the calmest of all little jet setters. ‘I’m lucky my little one loves to travel like me – no whimpering taking off or landing,’ she told British Vogue. ‘She’s a good girl: she sleeps very well, she hardly ever cries and I’m told she’s very alert for her age. ‘She’s just started waving, which is fun. She laughs a lot. She’s almost talking. ‘I think she might walk before she crawls. And she’s got six teeth already.’ Got a story?
