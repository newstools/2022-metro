If you love a house with an interesting history, a new property listing could be for you. A farmhouse called Croes Vaen in North Monmouthshire, Wales, is on the market. While the house itself may not ring any bells, the architect behind it might – as he’s also known for designing some of the UK’s most famous landmarks. The late Sir Aston Webb was the mastermind behind this particular property – but he also has Buckingham Palace and the V&A in his architectural portfolio. But not only does Croes Vaen have a famous 19th century designer behind it, the property also has plenty to offer as a home. The stone-built house was created around 1890 and is particularly nice on the eye – built in the ‘Arts and Crafts’ Tudor style. It’s also placed on a Grade II-listed site – surrounded by 72 acres of pastures, orchards and woodland. Inside, the space is spread across two floors with three reception rooms, six bedrooms and two bathrooms. While being serene and tranquil, it’s not completely out in the sticks – as it’s located four miles from Monmouth and three miles from the English border, with road links to the Midlands, South Wales and London. With such a rich history – not to mention real curb appeal – it’s hardly a surprise this home comes with a hefty price tag. Currently, the house plus the 15 acres of land is up for sale at £1.2million ($1.6 million). But if you want the other 52 acres too, the entire plot could cost as much as £1.7million.
