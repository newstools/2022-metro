A teenager has been charged with plotting to carry out a terror attack. Al-Arfat Hassan is alleged to have been preparing a crime against innocent people. The 19-year-old from London was arrested by specially-trained officers after a ‘proactive operation’ last week. Now he has been charged with offences which could carry decades in prison if he is found guilty. Scotland Yard said Hassan is accused of an offence under the ‘preparation of terrorist acts’ section of anti-terror legislation. He also stands accused of accessing information likely to be useful to a person preparing an act of terrorism. He is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in central London on Wednesday. The day after his arrest, detectives were granted a warrant of further detention from the court. This gave them until until March 10 to question Hassan under powers which allow terror suspects to be held longer than other supposed offenders. In a statement announcing the charges, a Metropolian Police spokesperson urged people to report suspicions of terrorist activity. It read: ‘Communities defeat terrorism, and information from the public is vital to counter terrorism investigations.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
