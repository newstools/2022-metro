Arsenal are leading candidates to sign PSV winger Cody Gakpo, according to reports in the Netherlands. The 22-year-old has been PSV’s standout performer in attack this season with 16 goals and 14 assists so far. Gakpo signed a contract extension in January, keeping him tied to the Eredivisie club until 2026. But it’s understood that PSV would allow Gakpo to leave the club this summer if they receive an acceptable offer. Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Liverpool have all been linked with a move for the Netherlands international, but according to VI, it’s Arsenal who are in ‘pole position’ for the winger’s signature. PSV are reportedly holding out for at least a £35 million fee for Gakpo, although the deal is expected to top the €40m (£36m) figure Napoli paid to sign Hirving Lozano in 2019. Gakpo has excelled on PSV’s left flank this season but has struggled as a central striker. Speaking last week, Netherlands head coach Louis van Gaal suggested that Gakpo will be part of Netherlands’ World Cup squad later this year but made it clear that he is unlikely to start as a striker in his 3-5-2 system. ‘He was injured, so he left after the implementation of the new system,’ said Van Gaal. ‘I have called on him and Jurrien Timber to let them participate in that implementation. These are guys who I think will definitely come to Qatar. ‘He [Gakpo] has played as a striker a few times but he has not always done that well. ‘That’s why I had a conversation with him about where he should play. We discussed that. There are positions that I think he could play there, but of course that depends on form and fitness – too often he is not fit. We talked about that too.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
