An impostor pretending to be the Ukrainian prime minister managed to speak with the Defence Secretary on the phone. Ben Wallace said he ‘terminated’ the call after becoming suspicious at the caller’s ‘misleading’ questions. According to a defence source, the senior Cabinet minister ordered an ‘immediate’ inquiry into how he was able to speak with him. Mr Wallace also suggested it may have been a plot directly from Moscow, insisting ‘no amount of Russian disinformation’ would distract from its invasion of Ukraine, which he misspelt as ‘Ukriane’. ‘Today an attempt was made by an imposter claiming to be Ukrainian PM to speak with me,’ he tweeted. ‘He posed several misleading questions and after becoming suspicious I terminated the call. ‘No amount of Russian disinformation, distortion and dirty tricks can distract from Russia’s human rights abuses and illegal invasion of Ukriane. A desperate attempt.’ Home Secretary Priti Patel said she had also been targeted by a call from an impostor. ‘This also happened to me earlier this week,’ she said. ‘Pathetic attempt at such difficult times to divide us. We stand with Ukraine.’ The fact a hoax caller was able to speak directly to the Defence Secretary raises severe security questions, particularly given Mr Wallace’s suggestion that Russia was behind it. Mr Wallace is not the first minister to fall foul of a fake call. In 2018, Boris Johnson, who was Foreign Secretary at the time, talked about international relations and rude poetry with a hoax caller pretending to be the Armenian prime minister.
