Almost as quickly as it arrived – Britain’s ‘mini heatwave’ will be replaced by colder weather. Yesterday marked the hottest day of the year so far, with the mercury hitting 20.7°C in North Wales and 20.5°C in London. People flocked to their local beaches as temperatures in the UK beat the likes of Marbella and Lanzarote. The warmer weather has been caused by a burst of ‘African heat’ that passed through much of the region. But forecasters have warned people to make the most of the remaining sun – as  cold weather and rain will return next week. Temperatures could dip to lows of between -6°C and -8°C in Scotland on March 31. Some spring flurries will fall on higher ground where 8cms of snow is expected. Chilly weather of around 0°C is forecast in the Borders and Wales’s weather could hover between 1°C and 3°C. England could see highs of 4°C in Cornwall. A spokesman from the Met Office told Metro.co.uk: ‘A trend to showery and colder conditions is expected to take place from the north next week. ‘Tuesday will probably be cloudier than of late with a chance of showers, these potentially wintry across the high ground in the far northeast. ‘However a good deal of dry weather will persist in the south and west. From midweek a colder spell is likely to spread south from the north. ‘Showers are possible in all areas, with these most frequent in the north and east. ‘Later next week and beyond, unsettled conditions are likely with more frequent showers or longer spells of rain for many areas.’ But a sunny Easter could be on the cards –  temperatures are ‘likely’ to return to average after the cold snap next week is through.
