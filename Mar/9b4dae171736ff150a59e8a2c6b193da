 This is the shocking moment two dognappers stroke a woman’s French bulldog before snatching her beloved pet. CCTV shows the pair hiding behind a fence as they wait for Caroline Busby, 60, to walk past with one-year-old Luna. They began talking with her and knelt down on the pretence of befriending Luna, but suddenly unhooked her collar and ran off with her. Ms Busby and her family frantically searched for the dog following last Thursday’s theft in Malvern, Worcestershire, and posted footage of the yobs on Facebook. Thankfully, police found Luna wandering on her own a day later in Strensham, a village eight miles away. Caroline’s daughter Kirsty Groves, 34, said: ‘You can see on the CCTV that they are crouched down, waiting for her to come around the corner. ‘My mum thought maybe they were doing their shoelaces or something. They turned her over to presumably see if she was male or female and asked my mum how old the dog was. ‘She told them she was only one. Then they just unclipped her and ran.’ She said her mother is now a ‘nervous wreck’ and does not want to walk her dog alone anymore. ‘She’s a defenceless 60-year-old woman, it’s so unfair,’ she added. ‘We are really angry someone has made my mum feel this way. What is wrong with people?’ Ms Groves believes Luna was found thanks to people sharing their online appeal. She added: ‘We can only think that the theft was purely down to money. French bulldogs are expensive.’ West Mercia Police are now hunting the two dognappers. A spokesperson said: ‘Two males in their early twenties were seen running towards Mayfield Road carrying the dog in their arms. ‘Police are continuing with their investigations and are determined to track down the offenders.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
