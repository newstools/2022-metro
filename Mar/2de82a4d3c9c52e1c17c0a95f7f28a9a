Former Manchester United manager Frank O’Farrell has passed away the age of 94. The Irishman replaced legendary manager Sir Matt Busby at Old Trafford in the early 1970s. O’Farrell lasted just 18 months in the hotseat at the Theatre of Dreams as he faced an almost impossible task of replacing Busby, who had guided United to the European Cup just three years earlier. The wing-back is best known for his stint with West Ham during his playing days, making 213 appearances and scoring eight times for the Hammers. O’Farrell had spells at Weymouth, Torquay and Leicester City as manager before landing the role at United, having charmed Busby with his man-management. He managed to talk George Best out of retirement in order to return to the club but replacing Busby was a step too far. After leaving United, O’Farrell spent time with Cardiff City, the Iran national side and Al-Shaab in the UAE. ‘Everyone at the club is saddened by the news of the passing of Frank O’Farrell at the age of 94,’ West Ham wrote on Twitter. ‘Rest in peace, Frank.’ MORE : Thierry Henry worried about Neymar’s mental health as PSG performance slump continues For more stories like this, check our sport page.
