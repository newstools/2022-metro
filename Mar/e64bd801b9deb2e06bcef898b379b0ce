Hollyoaks star Ray Quinn has announced he is expecting his first child with fiancee Emily Ashleigh. The couple – who already have a child each from previous relationships – shared the joyful news on Sunday with a dreamy video filmed at St. Helens Theatre Royal in Warrington. In the stunning clip, Emily is seen sauntering through the theatre towards the stage dressed in a bridal-like slip dress. There she meets Ray, dressed in a white shirt and jeans, who extends his hand out to his fiancee. The pair then share a romantic dance under the twinkling lights before cradling Emily’s baby bump and revealing the baby scan. ‘Time to tell the world.. 🤍,’ Ray captioned the Instagram video. Ray’s co-star on the Channel 4 soap Kieron Richardson led the congratulatory messages and commented: ‘Congratulations to you both!!! Wooo 👏😍.’ Ray, 33, is already father to son Harry who he shares with ex-wife Emma Stephens, while Emily also has son Lucien from a previous relationship. The couple got engaged in 2020 and the former X Factor star previously opened up about their relationship, telling Star magazine three years prior: ‘She’s a school teacher and we made it official last June. It was fate. ‘I believe whatever’s meant for you won’t pass you by. I can’t stand dating apps. A text message or a picture on Tinder is absolutely pointless.’ After popping the question on New Year’s, Ray told his followers: ‘Welcome to the family my Queen #shesaidyes.’ Emily added: ‘The most beautiful things are not seen or heard, but felt …. Falling in love with you is just indescribable…..Forever it is.’ Got a story?
