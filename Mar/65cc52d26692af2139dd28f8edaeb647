Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl has been added to Manchester United’s managerial shortlist, with the board keen to explore options beyond Erik Ten Hag and Mauricio Pochettino. United want to make an appointment before the end of the season and plan on speaking to Ten Hag and Pochettino in the coming weeks. But, with as little as £50m to spend this summer, there’s no guarantee that United will be able to attract managers from Ajax and Paris Saint-Germain. That’s left he board with little option but to expand their shortlist and the Mirror say Hasenhuttl has been added to the list of potential candidates. The Austrian has excelled at Southampton, turning the Saints into one of the most watchable and entertaining sides in the division. He shares many of the same ideas as Ralf Rangnick and United want a manager that can continue the German’s modernisation of the club’s style. Rangnick worked with Hasenhuttl at RB Leipzig and United’s board will consult with the German over their next appointment. While United still favour Pochettino or Ten Hag, Hasenhuttl would be more readily available and he has Premier League experience, which gives him an edge over Ten Hag. Southampton were unlucky to leave Old Trafford with just a point last month, with Hasenhuttl’s high-press tactics proving difficult for United.
