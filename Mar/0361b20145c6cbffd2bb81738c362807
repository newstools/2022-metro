To mark five years since launching its £99 Mystery Holiday Deal, Wowcher has announced new destinations and prizes for those who book. Effectively a ‘surprise’, customers’ destination of travel is revealed after they buy, with European mini-breaks and more far-flung stays up for grabs. Some people who’ve taken the plunge since 2017 have ended up with a couple of nights in Dublin, while others have nabbed bucket list trips to Miami and Vietnam. As part of the anniversary special, there are now 100 destinations available as part of the deal, including new locations like Barbados, Dubai, Thailand, and Mexico. Closer to home, there are holidays to Disneyland Paris, Lake Como, Barcelona, Porto, and a variety of European tourist spots available – the draw may even see you boarding a Chocolate and Cheese train heading through the Swiss countryside. All stays include travel and accommodation, but some lucky travellers can also win extras like attraction tickets, hotel upgrades, sightseeing cruises, dining and more. Savings platform Wowcher will also pick 10 customers at random to receive luggage and 10 to receive £250 spending money. The deal costs £99 per person for travel between September and December 2022, or £129 for travel between April and July 2022. The draw takes place on April 14, after which those who’ve booked will be notified where they’re going. If you’re drawn a destination where restrictions prevent travel, Wowcher will offer ‘a suitable alternative’. A sub-£100 holiday is rare to come by regardless. So if you’re happy to let fate do your travel planning, you could end up saving big on the trip of a lifetime. Check it out here. Do you have a story to share?
