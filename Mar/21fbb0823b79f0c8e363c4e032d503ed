Antonio Conte has hit back at Mikel Arteta after the Arsenal manager revealed he was concerned about the schedule his team are set to endure over the coming weeks. The Gunners were beaten by Liverpool in midweek and have been given only three days to recover ahead of Saturday’s trip to Aston Villa. Arteta’s side will face an equally tight turnaround in between potentially pivotal fixtures against Chelsea and Manchester United next month, while the Spaniard revealed he was ‘concerned’ as to when the Premier League would schedule the north London derby. That fixture was postponed earlier this season, despite Arsenal’s squad affected by just one case of coronavirus at the time. Arteta faced intense criticism at the time, not least from Spurs who released a scathing statement criticising their near neighbours. Speaking ahead of tomorrow’s game, Arteta doubled down on his criticism of the fixture compilers, saying: ‘Yes (I am concerned), because I don’t know and we are not going to be deciding and it’s going to be very important. ‘That’s nothing to do with me. The club has to arrange those conversations.’ However, Spurs coach Conte has now dismissed those fears, reminding Arteta that it was Arsenal that requested the derby be called off in the first place. ‘I only want Arteta to remember the game postponed – Tottenham-Arsenal – if we speak about unfair,’ Conte said. ‘In general, I think my answer is enough. If someone wants to think about fair or unfair. We postponed the game, Tottenham-Arsenal if you remember. I don’t forget this. And it’s not right to speak about fair or unfair.’ MORE : Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta reacts to Ben White, Aaron Ramsdale, Emile Smith Rowe and Bukayo Saka England call-ups MORE : Arsenal hero Ray Parlour wants Mikel Arteta to take ‘gamble’ on Everton and Brentford stars For more stories like this, check our sport page.
