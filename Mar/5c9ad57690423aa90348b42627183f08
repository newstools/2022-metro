A horrified walker had to watch as a farmer killed their dog because it wouldn’t stop worrying sheep. The pet broke free of its lead and attacked livestock on the Cheshire farm yesterday, leaving one with bite marks on its nose. Police said the owner attempted to call the dog back, but when it didn’t respond, the farmer shot it dead. Officers called it a ‘very sad event’ and issued a warning about the importance of keeping dogs under control. Sergeant Rob Simpson said: ‘Numerous attempts were made by the dog’s owner and the farmer who arrived on scene, before they were left with no other option. ‘Again, the action taken was witnessed by everyone present and it’s upsetting for all involved. ‘No one wants to shoot a family pet, but it’s clear in law that someone protecting their livestock has this option available to them. ‘Ask yourself, if my dog broke free from its lead, am I happy that it will listen to my commands? Have I really got control? If you’re not sure, please keep it away from livestock, even if you’re using a lead.’ An officer at the scene in Disley, said all involved, including the farmer and dog owner, are co-operating with the police. Just days before, Sergeant Simpson shared a letter that had been put on a local farmer’s gate. The note read: ‘We have pregnant ewes in this field. We have just had the vet to put down a pregnant ewe. ‘Please keep your dogs on a lead. They may not attack but can still scare and chase our ewes.’ According to figures from the National Farmers’ Union (NFU), 15,000 sheep are killed by dogs in the UK every year. The Kennel Club said the figures suggest more than two thirds (70%) of the attacks take place when dogs are not with their owner. In some cases, this happens when a dog escapes from a garden.
