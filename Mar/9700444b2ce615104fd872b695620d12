The 2022 Baftas are here which, in the fashion world, means only one thing – time to check out those all-important red carpet looks. With the likes of Lady Gaga, Tessa Thompson and Alana Haim among the nominees in with a chance of winning this year, we’re looking forward to the looks being as on-point as ever. Here, you’ll find a list of fits from the red carpet updated live as the celebs arrive at London’s Royal Albert Hall. (We’ll be keeping the list alphabetised by the stars’ first names, rather than listing any order of preference.) Do you have a story to share?
