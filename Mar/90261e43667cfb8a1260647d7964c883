A mother who has reached her wit’s end with her child’s truancy has now been put under a curfew. Despite dragging the teenager to the school gates and chasing them around the streets, she has been punished. On one occasion when she tried to physically make him attend, teachers told her that he could not be forced to go. She admitted being the parent of a child who failed to attend school regularly at Staffordshire Magistrates’ Court on Monday. As a result, she was given a month-long curfew from 7pm until 6am and was ordered to pay over £300 in costs. She attended with her child so that they could see the consequences their behaviour was having. Despite the trouble the situation has caused for the mother, the child said they didn’t like school and would find it difficult to go back. Speaking on the mother’s behalf, James Hulse said the child had regularly attended their previous school. However, he added: ‘(The mum) has dragged (the teenager) to the school gates. ‘When they get there the teachers said they can’t drag (them) into school, it’s (their) choice. She has chased (her child) around the streets.’ One mum in Malaysia took drastic action after her eight-year-old daughter decided to skip her Mandarin class at school – chaining her to a lamppost with a metal chain as a punishment.
