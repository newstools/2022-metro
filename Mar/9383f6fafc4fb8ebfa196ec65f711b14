A woman taking the subway in New York City allegedly slashed another female rider’s face after confronting her for eating on the train. The straphanger approached the victim, 33, while she was eating and told her to stop, according to the New York Police Department. The suspect ‘displayed a knife’ and ‘slashed her on both sides of her face’, the department tweeted late Tuesday. It happened on the southbound D line train around 10.30pm last Wednesday. The suspect fled at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn, according to police. Meanwhile, the victim was transported to NYU Langone Hospital Brooklyn for treatment. Her condition was stable. Police released images of the suspect, showing she has dark hair, wore a dark jacket, light-colored sweater and blue jeans. Police are offering up to $3,500 as a reward for information leading to an arrest. It is one of the latest violent incidents in the city’s crime-ridden subway system. The police department also shared video of a March 14 incident showing a group of unidentified individuals attacking a 14-year-old boy at the Van Siclen subway station in Brooklyn. The group punched the boy in his and head repeatedly, according to WNBC. The boy was taken to a hospital and is expected to recover, and the suspects remain at large. In another gruesome attack, a man was caught on camera smearing feces on a woman’s face at the East 241st Street subway station in the Bronx in late February. A suspect, Frank Abrokwa, was arrested weeks later after allegedly committing another crime, violating the conditions of his supervised release from the excrement incident. The February 21 crime took place just three days after New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced a Subway Safety Plan that deploys 1,000 police officers in an effort to to curb crime across the transit system.
