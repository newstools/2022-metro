Tragedy struck a school in Essex today as a year seven boy died following a ‘medical emergency’. There were fears for the child as pupils were on their lunch break at Shoebury High School in Southend-on-Sea. The boy, thought to be 11 or 12, was flown away in an air ambulance with paramedics but sadly died. An email sent to councillors suggested he could have suffered a heart attack, although this is unconfirmed, the Echo reports. The school said children will be spoken to about their classmate’s death ‘first thing’ tomorrow. Specialist support has also been put in place for them. ‘At lunchtime there was a medical issue that involved one child; no other individuals were involved’, a spokesperson said. ‘The ambulance and air ambulance service supported the child and were assisted by the police who then remained onsite as part of their protocol and to support staff and students. ‘We can confirm he has sadly died and out of respect to the family, we will not be commenting further at this stage.’ Information distributed to local councillors said: ‘It is with sadness to report that a Year 7 boy was taken ill at the school today and taken away by air ambulance. ‘He has apparently suffered a heart attack, and unfortunately, he has been pronounced dead. ‘The school will remain open tomorrow, and we will try as far as possible to continue as normal, and we have asked for critical incident support and counselling to be made available.’ An Essex Police spokesman said officers were called to the scene around 1.20pm by colleagues from the ambulance service. ‘We are treating this as a medical episode’, he added.
