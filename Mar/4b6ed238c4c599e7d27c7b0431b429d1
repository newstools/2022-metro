A man has been filmed throwing a Molotov cocktail at the walls of the Kremlin. Footage of the attack has been circulating on Russian media channels after first being shared on TikTok. The seconds-long clip was initially posted to the social media site by a user called @den_di1232. The video appears to have been filmed from inside a moving vehicle and captures the moment an unknown person launches a Molotov cocktail against the wall of the Kremlin. The caption on the clip, which has racked up some 400,000 views, reads ‘Moscow, Kremlin’ in Russian. The improvised weapon can be seen hitting the outer walls of the building leaving scorch marks before falling to the ground where it continues to burn. The Kremlin is the home to Russia’s government and is the official residence of the Russian president Vladimir Putin. News of the attack has been shared by local media outlets, including the Belarusian media channel NEXTA Live. Since Mr Putin gave the order for his troops to invade Ukraine on February 24 there have been a number of protests against the conflict within Russia. Just days after the war started more than 3,000 people were arrested as thousands took to the streets in Moscow and St Petersburg to oppose the conflict. There have also been attempts to break through the Kremlin’s propaganda on state-controlled TV, most notably when an editor gate crashed a prime time news show to hold up a banner denouncing the war.
