Love & Hip Hop star Apple Watts is reportedly fighting for her life after a horror crash. The rapper was driving on I-15 on California on Wednesday when her black Mercedes collided with a pick-up truck. Her car flipped over multiple times before bursting into flames, according to TMZ. She was pulled out of her car by a passenger of the pick-up truck, before being air-lifted to a Nevada hospital, where she’s being treated for ‘major injuries’. Watts’ sister confirmed to The Shade Room that she was driving from LA to Las Vegas when the crash happened, and that she is unresponsive at the moment. She added that she has suffered a fractured skull, a broken spine, and a shattered arm. Watts rose to fame on the fifth and sixth series of Love & Hip Hip, showing her career transition from being a dancer to become a music artist. In her introduction video for the show, she said: ‘Since I was younger, I’ve loved being around music. I love rapping, I love freestyling, I love singing. But it was hard for me to get in the game because I’m a woman and a dancer. ‘They don’t take a girl seriously.’ Before her appearance on the show, she had starred in music videos for artists including Snoop Dogg and Chris Brown. Love & Hip Hip Hop is a VH1 TV franchise documenting the lives of hip hip artists, performers, managers, and record producers in various cities in the US.
