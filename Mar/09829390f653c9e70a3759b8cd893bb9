If you love things in teeny tiny form, a new exhibition could be right up your street. A show celebrating weird and wonderful works from some of the greatest artists in the miniature art movement is landing in London next month. The exhibition, called Small Is Beautiful, will feature more than 130 miniature artworks and 80 photographic pieces from artists around the world. It’s come about following the popularity of #MiniatureArt on social media – so organisers hope to give guests a glimpse into the magical miniature world, highlighting some of the best artists in the movement. Visitors will be able to take a glimpse into a number of small-scale universes and experience a behind-the-scenes video space as well as a pop-up shop. There will also be creative miniature art workshops for children ages 7 to 12 – with the aim to motivate new potential new artists in this field. Work from London-based photographer Slinkachu will also be on show, including his ‘Miniature Street Art’ – which sees him use everyday objects to recreate miniature real-life situations, including an installation of a serpent attacking a little girl and her mother from a green shoelace in a puddle. The show will make its debut in the heart of London at 81 Old Brompton Road and is set to open on April 15 – although tickets can be booked in advance now. Serge Victoria, Director, a producer for the exhibition, says: ‘One of the main purposes of the show is to be able to give the public the chance to discover miniature art in real life. ‘There is a difference between looking at an Instagram post and getting “inside the screen” and seeing the work up close and personal.’ Do you have a story to share?
