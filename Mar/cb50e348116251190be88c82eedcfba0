Rita Ora and Kate Moss may be miles away from home, but the stars still managed to meet up at Disneyland California for a dose of some much-needed escapism. The fun and frolics unfolded on Tuesday, with The Masked Singer judge Rita sharing a carousel of photos from her day out with supermodel Kate, and former Towie star Vas J Morgan, who now lives in the US, making for a star-studded Brits abroad reunion. Getting into the spirit of the Happiest Place On Earth, Rita, 31, proudly donned her Minnie Mouse ears and took photos among bubbles. Despite being away from the UK, the I Will Never Let You Down singer represented her home country by wearing a beanie hat featuring the Union Jack flag. Kate, 48, of course being the chic fashionista she is, teamed her own set of Mouse ears with a leopard print cami top and black jacket. They were joined by a large number of friends, including two small children, as they posed for a big group shot in front of one of the castles, and also let loose on some of the rollercoaster rides. In the Instagram caption, Rita confessed: ‘I had the time of my life at Disney land with my faves! My cheeks (not my butt cheeks but those too from all the rollercoasters) hurt from laughing so much! Even when drifting off in a car like the princess’s we all are! 🌞❤️😁’ Missing from the action was the singer’s boyfriend Taika Waititi, who she was last spotted loved-up with at the Critics’ Choice Awards last week. They proved to be the most popular couple of the night with stars such as Kristen Stewart and Serena Williams keen to grab photos with them. Perhaps Rita has a little more free time on her schedule after the sudden axing of Disney Plus’ prequel series of Beauty and the Beast. The chart-topping singer announced she has joined the cast of the TV series, starring alongside Luke Evans and Josh Gad, but it was confirmed the show had been cancelled just two days later. Sharing her excitement about the ill-fated series, Rita had said: ‘I can’t keep the secret any longer! I’m beyond excited to be be [sic] joining the cast of the Beauty and the Beast prequel series! As a child, I remember watching Beauty and the Beast with my family over and over and immediately falling in love with the music and characters. ‘Never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined joining this fairytale world. ‘To everyone that helped make this happen, I am forever grateful. Thank you to Disney+, my CAA squad – Dan, Joella, and Tracy – Shari, and my management family. Lately I just feel like all my dreams are coming true! Life is feeling like a Disney movie!’ Got a story?
