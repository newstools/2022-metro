With so many tasty baked goods on offer – from sausage rolls (plus vegan ones) to steak bakes – it’s unlikely that any trip to Greggs will disappoint. And if you fancy something sweet, their cookies hit the spot, too. But it seems these freshly-baked sweet treats will no longer just be an option in Greggs stores, as Iceland will soon be stocking a ‘bake your own’ variety. The supermarket will be unveiling these cookies in two different flavours: triple chocolate and milk chocolate – both offering a crumbly cookie base with chunky chocolate pieces. These goodies can be baked from frozen – which is perhaps the secret to the gooey centre. They were spotted on the Extreme Couponing Facebook group after someone posted a picture of the discovery – but it’s unclear when they will be hitting stores everywhere (although, Metro.co.uk have reached out for more details). Nevertheless, it’s safe to say that fans have gone wild for them. It’s worth pointing out that Iceland already stocks many other popular Greggs products, such as various bakes, pies, pasties and more – so the cookies will join the line-up. Perhaps this will make up for the fact that the bakery chain have axed traditional hot cross buns from their menu this Easter. A spokesperson for Greggs said: ‘Our Hot Cross Buns are taking a well-deserved rest from our Easter menu this year but keep an eye out for our other exciting Easter products which will be in shops soon.’ Do you have a story to share?
