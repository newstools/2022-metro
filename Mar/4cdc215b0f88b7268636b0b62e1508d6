Prince Harry is clearly feeling at home in America, donning a cowboy hat for a trip to a rodeo. The Duke tried to remain incognito as he enjoyed the Stockyards Rodeo at Fort Worth, Texas – but some commented that the visit didn’t seem in keeping with the views of his wife. Meghan Markle is a patron of the London-based Mayhew Trust animal charity and often speaks publicly about animal rights. She previously encouraged her husband to quit hunting back in 2018. Two years later, he sold his set of rifles for an impressive £50,000. One attendee of this week’s rodeo told the Daily Mail: ’It’s a quintessentially American event, where animals are made to perform. ‘Given he has such a lack of respect for the First Amendment and his wife is such an animal rights activist – it is shocking he thought he could show his face here. ‘The funny thing is most people didn’t recognize him or care.’ Royal correspondent Omid Scobie tweeted of the visit: ‘The duke was spotted by locals enjoying some good ol’ Southern hospitality and a VIP tour of the venue.’ Rodeo events typically involve events such as bareback horse and bull riding, ‘saddle bronc riding’ and steer roping. It was perhaps a blast from the past for the Prince, who had worked as a ‘Jackaroo Cowboy’ during his gap year. The 19-year-old had been based at the 39,500-acre Australian ranch owned by Annie Hill, a long-time friend of the late Princess Diana. It had been Harry’s first experience of living outside the United Kingdom. The rodeo was his latest stereotypically American outing, after he was photographed at the Super Bowl with Princess Eugenie. Dozens of famous faces – including Kendall Jenner and Ryan Reynolds – sat alongside them to see the Los Angeles Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20.
