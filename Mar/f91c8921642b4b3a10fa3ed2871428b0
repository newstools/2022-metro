Jamie Redknapp is enjoying all the best things about being a new father – namely, giving your baby a funny hairstyle. The former professional footballer, 48, welcomed baby Raphael with wife Frida Andersson, 38, in November last year, and has instantly become a devoted and doting father. As tough as parenthood is, Jamie and Frida are loving life with their four-month-old son, with the former Liverpool star sharing sweet updates on family life to social media. On Thursday, Jamie shared a ridiculously cute snap to Instagram showing off his son’s honestly incredible amount of hair, styled into an impressive Mohican. In the photo, Raphael, dressed in a warm grey jumper, had his hair styled in a massive, messy Mohican, looking like he’d fit in fairly well with the punks on the streets of Camden. Mum Frida could be seen in the background, keeping a protective arm on her son’s neck as Jamie took the photo. He captioned it simply with a series of red heart emojis. A second photo uploaded by the former pro footballer showed him in pure dad mode, pushing his son in a pram as the family enjoyed a walk in Hyde Park. Later in the day the father and son met with football legend and family friend Ruud Gullit, with Jamie sharing a cute photo of Raphael sitting on his knee, his cool hairstyle still holding up nicely. Sharing the photo to his Instagram Stories, Jamie joked: ‘Hoping some [football magic rubs off from the great man @ruudgullit.’ In November, Jamie shared the happy news of Raphael’s arrival with a gorgeous post on social media, complete with a picture of him beaming alongside the new arrival. He wrote: ‘Meet Raphael Anders Redknapp, we’re so in love, mum is doing so well too. ‘We can’t thank the amazing doctors and nurses at the Chelsea and Westminster enough 🙏🏻. So excited for him to meet my boys.’ Frida shared a series of images to her own account, with a doting Jamie planting a kiss on Raphael’s head. Jamie already shares two children, sons Charley, 17, and Beau, 13, with ex-wife Louise Rednapp, and he was married to the former Eternal singer for 19 years until their split in 2017. Jamie and Frida have been linked since August 2020, with the pair marrying in an intimate ceremony in October 2021 in front of around 30 family and friends. The model is also a mother to four children – three boys and one girl – with ex-husband Jonathan Lourie, a 58-year-old American hedge fund manager. Got a story?
