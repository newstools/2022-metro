Police are hunting a man after money being collected for Ukraine victims was stolen. The Metropolitan Police Force has released an image of the person they are looking for after a collection box was taken from the Sawmill cafe in West Ham Lane, Stratford. The box is believed to have contained around £100 and was taken shortly after noon last Thursday. The suspect ran away from the cafe while being chased by a member of staff, and was driven away in a car. The picture of the man was taken after he was seen by witnesses putting something in the car, and then ran around to the other side of the car. Newham Police officers say they are making enquiries around this vehicle. Anyone who recognises the man should call 101 and quote reference 4698/05mar.
