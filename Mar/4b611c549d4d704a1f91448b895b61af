Deliveroo has been sorting us out with pizza, ramen, sushi and burger deliveries for years. But now the delivery giant has launched a real-life restaurant of its own. The new pizza parlour run by Deliveroo is located in Swiss Cottage, London, and follows the launch of eight ‘Editions’ sites (AKA, ghost kitchens with no restaurant seating) worldwide. It goes by the name of Pizza Paradiso and boasts both indoor and outdoor tables, as well as a front-of-house pizza oven and a full kitchen out the back. The menu is pretty reasonable too, with pizzas coming in between £5.95 and £9.75. Customers can also pick from starters including garlic bread and dough wedges (from £3.95-£4.95) as well as vegan brownie, tiramisu and cheesecake for dessert. The idea is that launching a real-life restaurant will help the brand better understand pain points in the hospitality industry – and how to overcome them, as a result. In January, a spokesperson for Deliveroo told the Wall Street Journal that physically running a restaurant should give the organisation and staff ‘a deep understanding of restaurant owners’ mindsets.’ But it’s worth pointing out there are no current plans to expand beyond this one IRL location. Deliveroo has also stressed there will be no special treatment for Pizza Paradiso on the app – so it will still be charged a commission, like other restaurants, on every order.
