Antonio Conte believes Arsenal have an advantage over Tottenham in the race to finish fourth in the Premier League because the Gunners have been working longer with Mikel Arteta. Spurs kept up the pressure on their north London rivals with a 3-1 victory over West Ham on Sunday. Arsenal are in the driving seat to finish fourth as they currently occupy that position and are three points ahead of Spurs, who have played one game more. Spurs are due to face Arsenal in the Premier League before the end of the season in a game that could determine who secures the final Champions League place. But Conte feels Arsenal have a ‘good advantage’ over Spurs. ‘The only way to put pressure on Arsenal is to get three points to win,’ Conte said after Spurs beat West Ham. ‘There are nine games to go and for us every game has to be a final and in this moment for sure they have a good advantage, also especially because they’re working with the same coach for many years and they’ve had many transfer markets with the same coach. ‘Maybe they are in this moment more ready than us but I think in five months we did a fantastic job with these players and now I think that we reduced the gap with many teams in England. ‘One example, two months ago we played against Chelsea three times and we lost three games but it was right to lose these three games because Chelsea showed to be better than us in every aspect. ‘After two months now I would like to have another chance to see which is our level and I’m sure now our level has improved a lot and now I’m sure that Chelsea could fight much more to win the game against us than before.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
