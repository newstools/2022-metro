A 48-year-old woman has been accused of murder in Northamptonshire, police said on Sunday. Fiona Beal was formally charged shortly after midnight, following the discovery of what is thought to be a missing man’s body buried in a Northampton back garden. Officers had initially been called to Moore Street, Kingsley, on Wednesday, to search the entire property. The investigation began after the arrest of Beal at a hotel in Cumbria early that morning. By Saturday afternoon, with the help of forensic officers, specialist search teams, and a cadaver dog, a body had been discovered. The remains are expected be taken to Leicester where they will be forensically examined by a Home Office pathologist. Northamptonshire Police said dozens of officers and specialist staff had been involved in the operation. Detective Chief Inspector Adam Pendlebury, from East Midlands Special Operations Unit’s major crime team, explained: ‘Regrettably, I can confirm that a body has been found in the rear garden of the address. ‘We believe it to be that of a missing 42-year-old male, but formal identification has yet to take place. ‘Police officers have been conducting house-to-house inquiries in the area over the past couple of days. ‘This remains a complex and challenging investigation.’ Beal is due to appear at Northampton Magistrates’ Court on Monday morning.
