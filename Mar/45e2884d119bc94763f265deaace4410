A young Ukrainian boy is being hailed a ‘hero’ after travelling 600 miles to safety all by himself. The 11-year-old from Zaporizhzhya fled to Slovakia with a single plastic bag and a phone number written on his hand. His mother put him on a train heading for the border in the hope he would be taken in by kind-hearted strangers. In a video, the boy’s mother, Yulia Pisecka, said: ‘There’s a nuclear power plant next to my town, which the Russians were shooting at. It was on fire.

A small country has people with big hearts. Please save our Ukrainian children and give them a safe haven.’ The boy was picked up by volunteers at the border who looked after him and gave him food and drink.  ‘He gained all of them with his smile, fearlessness and determination, worthy of a true hero,’ the Slovakian government said. Thanks to the phone number on his hand, the boy’s relatives in Slovakia were contacted and they came to pick him up. His family in Ukraine live in the shadow the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear power station near the Black Sea. It was taken over by Russian troops after heavy shelling last week, prompting widespread condemnation over fears it could trigger one of the biggest radiation leaks in history. Putin’s forces have also taken over Chernobyl, the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster in 1986. Ukrainian officials warned the Russian leader is risking a ‘large-scale ecological disaster’ after rockets were also reportedly fired at a nuclear research facility in Kharkiv, which contains nuclear material and a reactor.
