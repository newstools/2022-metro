WD-40 is a lubricant and degreaser used to stop hinges getting stiff and banish rust from metalwork. But did you know, you can also use it to clean your trainers? Over time, white trainers can get dirty and discolour, and although you can bung them in the washing machine it can be a pain. From waiting around for them to dry to bashing up the drum of your appliance, there are a number of reasons you might be looking for an easier solution – and that solution is right there in your toolbox. That’s because WD-40 is officially a ‘water displacement’ product, meaning it can remove sticky residues and caked-on grime. You can even waterproof your shoes with the multipurpose formula. It’s easy to do, and you’ll be surprised at how this DIY staple gets your favourite sneakers back to their bright white best. Here’s how. Step 1: Clean the excess dirt and grime with warm water and soap. Step 2: Use a shoe cleaning brush to loosen grime. Step 3: Spray WD-40 onto your shoe, (remember you can use the wide or precision spray function, depending on where the stain is). Step 4: Wipe the excess liquid off with a dry clean cloth. There’s no lengthy drying process or lingering damp smells, and you save yourself the work of scrubbing away. Most importantly, though, you’ll get more wear out of your shoes – and they’ll look better when you do. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
