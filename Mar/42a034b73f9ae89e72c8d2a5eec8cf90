Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury have found their dream home after a three-year search. The Love Island stars, both 22, announced the news with some snaps of their glam pad, revealing they were starting ‘a new chapter’ in their first home. They are also planning on sharing a lot more of their personal lives, after Molly decided to keep things offline when she was burgled last year. Sharing her newfound happiness with her 6.2million followers, Molly also revealed she has created an Instagram page dedicated to her new home, aptly named ‘Molly Maison.’ The PrettyLittleThing creative director posted two adorable snaps from the staircase in her luxurious abode, with joy evident on her face. She stood proudly on the marble tiles with her arms in the air, ecstatic to confirm it had ‘finally happened’ after a long road to finding their forever home. Writing on the Instagram story of her home account, the reality star wrote: ‘So… Hey guys. I can’t believe we’ve finally gotten to this point. A 3 year search for our first home, which some of you will have followed, has finally come to an end!!!’ Explaining that she’s moved on from her fears of oversharing, she continued: ‘I know a lot of you won’t have been expecting me to do a home account as I have become a lot more private about what I post of our home life… However having a home account is something that I’ve always dreamed of doing. ‘I’ve decided that I don’t want to let the past control my future, the way I live my life and what I share with you guys.’ Giving fans an insight into what to expect on their social media account going forwards, Molly added: ‘This account will show snippets of our home, this crazy new journey we are embarking on and day to day life within our house.’ She teased that there might also be ‘appearances from two fluffy animals,’ referring to the cats that Molly has shown in her YouTube videos. Her friends were quick to congratulate the loved-up couple on their move, with fellow Love Islander Maura Higgins saying her new home was ‘as fabulous as you.’ Fans were also overwhelmed by the shock announcement, writing: ‘over the moon for you both!!! you deserve this the most, congratulations 🥺😭🤍xxx’ Another commented: ‘I’m so happy for you both 🖤😭 you deserve all the happiness in world angel👼🏼!!!!XXX Congratulations❤️’ They’re also super excited to see her interior design process as the pair settle in to their home. Molly and Tommy were previously living in a flat after their Manchester home was broken in to while they were out one night. An ‘experienced gang’ broke in and made off with £800,000 of designer goods from their Hale home, with Molly admitting she no longer felt safe going back there afterwards. The couple were in London at the time, and became less comfortable sharing their pricey possessions online or giving a tour of their apartment after their privacy was invaded. Molly – who is thought to be a multi-millionaire – then spent thousands of pounds on security for protection, revealing she had security with her ‘everywhere’ she went. She told her vlog at the time: ‘Security is something we’ve had to take so much more seriously now, to the point where I’m spending thousands and thousands of pounds a month on having the right security. ‘At the end of the day, I don’t think I can put a price on feeling safe. I’ve never really known how to speak about it to be honest, because I feel like it’s something people could respond with “Who does she think she is?” ‘It’s genuinely for no other reason than it makes me feel more safe and after what happened it’s just something that makes me feel better.’ The break in also caused her to change her views on designer purchases as she feared doing anything to ‘compromise’ her and her boyfriend’s safety. But, it’s only up from here, as the couple make a new life for themselves in their stunning mansion, after documenting the house-hunting process and taking their time in finding the perfect one. The influencer has also revealed she is ‘so ready’ to have children with boxer Tommy, despite being so young, so who knows if we’ll be hearing the pitter patter of tiny feet in their dream home some time soon… Got a story?
