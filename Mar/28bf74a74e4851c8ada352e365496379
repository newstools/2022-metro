Big Mamma is behind some of the most talked about London Italian restaurants, owning Gloria, Circolo Poplare and Ave Mario. At the height of the pandemic the brand launched Napoli Gang, a pizza delivery service to keep serving up dishes to Londoners. This May, they’ll be opening their first pizza shop in Ladbroke Grove. The shop will offer click and collect, takeaway and delivery of pizzas, Italian produce, arancini, fresh pastas, Puglian burrata, desserts and other sides. As well as all being entirely homemade, the boxes food will be served in are also entirely recyclable. The Big Mamma group says the food isn’t the only reason to stop by though, wanting to entertain waiting customers. The brand says: ‘The shop itself has been elevated to the max by Big Mamma’s in-house design studio, Studio Kiki, with hot-pink neons and an interior covered in custom graffiti art by a local graffiti artist. ‘To keep you entertained as you wait, there will be kick-ass speakers playing retro MTV songs, the videos of which will be projected on the walls.’ When the queues for their main dine-in restaurants are out the door and it feels impossible to get a booking, heading West to Napoli Gang might be the way to go. We’ll be ordering a burrata and the pesto pizza, pronto. The new shop will open mid-May at 149 Ladbroke Grove, W10 6HJ. Do you have a story to share?
