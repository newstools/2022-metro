A ‘truly despicable’ cowboy builder who cheated pensioners out of hundreds of thousands of pounds has been banned from knocking on any door in the UK. Alan Fitzgerald, 53, was jailed for six years in 2014 after fleecing a total of £300,000 from 39 elderly victims. One victim handed over £39,000 while another, aged 94, agreed to pay £6,000 after being told she had asbestos in her home and would be prosecuted if she didn’t settle the bill. But just weeks after being freed from prison, remorseless Fitzgerald – branded ‘truly despicable’ by a judge – began to pursue more vulnerable pensioners. He was jailed for 40 months in April 2020 after admitting a further 10 charges of exploiting the elderly out of £14,000 in total. Now the fraudster, from Raunds, Northamptonshire, has been hit with a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) preventing him from making contact with anyone to sell them something. The order was made at Northampton Magistrates’ Court, following an application by Northamptonshire Police. He is banned from attending anyone’s home, making unsolicited calls or using any means online for any purpose related to the sale of any goods or service, on his or any other businesses behalf. He could end up behind bars if he breaks the order. Neighbourhood Policing Sergeant Chris Stevens said: ‘The criminal behaviour repeatedly demonstrated by Alan Fitzgerald means that this CBO was issued against him meaning that he cannot attempt to sell goods or services to anyone.’ ‘By issuing details of the order along with his photograph, we’re able to make members of the public aware of the restrictions imposed.’ Anyone who witnesses Fitzgerald breaching the order is asked to report it to police immediately by calling 101.
