A TikTok star in Iraqi Kurdistan who defied conservative Islamic conventions by wearing crop tops and a crucifix was allegedly shot dead by her brother. Eman Sami Maghdid, known to her 47,000 followers as Mari or Maria, is thought to have been murdered in an ‘honour’ killing. Her 17-year-old brother, who has not been named, allegedly fired eight or nine bullets at the influencer on a road in the city of Erbil on Sunday night. Police arrested the teen, as well as another person suspected of sheltering him. Eman, 20, was known for posting ‘rebellious’ photos and videos on social media — including pictures of her smoking cigarettes, voicing her opinions and wearing crop tops and a crucifix. It is believed she had not converted from Islam to Christianity but merely wore the item as a fashion statement. In a post on Facebook in August last year, she wrote: ‘I believe that humans will always suffer at the hands of other humans.’ Her death follows those of at least ten other women this year in Iraq’s Kurdistan region, including 23-year-old transgender woman Doski Azad, who was also shot dead, allegedly by her brother. She had had to move home regularly due to threats and was found dead in a ditch. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
