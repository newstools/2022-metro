After weeks of storms, rain and wind, we are all in need of a little vitamin D right now. So if the recent miserable weather has got you thinking ahead to summer plans, then an impressive Italian home should be on your radar. Villa Atia is a stately home nestled on the banks of Lake Como and was once the summer residence of the Dukes of Serbelloni. But now you and 11 friends can book it for the ultimate luxury getaway. With six opulent suites spread across the two wings, there’s plenty of room, and each bedroom comes with a twin/double bed and an en-suite bathroom. Despite oozing in history, all rooms are equipped with modern technology and are decorated with antique pieces and soft furnishings. There’s luxury at every turn too, with balconies, sweeping staircases, frescoed ceilings and a grand dining space. Likewise, at the back of the villa there’s a large swimming pool and an outdoor dining pergola – ideal for al fresco drinks and dinners. The garden also extends to the lake, so you can set sail and explore Lake Como’s pretty villages and historic villas. What’s more, the nearby towns and lakeside spots can be easily reached by road from Villa Atia. If that wasn’t enough, staff will be on hand throughout your stay – including a chef who can prepare every meal. Naturally, a villa like this comes at a price, costing £6,679 ($8,900) a night – which is around £556 per person if you fill all the beds. However, if you’re looking to really push the boat out after nearly two years of travel restrictions, this spot should definitely be on your travel bucket list. Do you have a story to share?
