Newcastle United midfielder Isaac Hayden is likely to face an FA charge after taking a dig at referee David Coote following the Magpies’ defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Eddie Howe’s side looked to have secured a well-earned point against Thomas Tuchel’s men but a last-gasp Kai Havertz goal gave the Blues all three points. It came after Havertz was lucky to stay on the pitch following an elbow on Dan Burn, while the Magpies were also furious that they were denied a penalty after Jacob Murphy was dragged down in the area. The defeat ended Newcastle’s nine-game unbeaten run and Hayden was furious that his side’s hard work was undone, with the midfielder blaming the officials. Hayden tweeted after the match to say that the Magpies had come up against ’12 men’, which was a direct dig at Coote’s officiating. ‘Some performance from the boys against 12 men today,’ said Hayden. ‘Proud to be associated with the club is an understatement.’ Replays showed Trevor Chalobah had a clear tug of Murphy’s shirt in the box but neither Coote nor VAR saw fit to take action. Howe was furious about the decision after the match, saying it cost his side. ‘You can’t look past the penalty for me,’ said Howe. I’m hugely disappointed with that decision and how they’ve reached that decision between them. ‘It’s a clear penalty, Jacob’s had his shirt ripped off his back near enough. ‘He goes down in the box, it’s a clear penalty, even if the referee doesn’t give it on the pitch I can sort of understand that… ‘But then VAR should see it and at least make the referee review his own decision ‘I think if he does, he realises he’s got it wrong.’ MORE : Luis Suarez sends message to Lionel Messi and Neymar after PSG fans boo during Ligue 1 match For more stories like this, check our sport page.
