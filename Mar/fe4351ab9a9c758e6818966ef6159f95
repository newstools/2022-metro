Leona Lewis has revealed she’s expecting her first child in the most radiant way, sending her fans wild with a beautiful baby bump photo. Earlier this month, it was reported that the Bleeding Love singer was pregnant, with it being claimed that the former X Factor winner and her husband, Dennis Jauch, were ‘over the moon’. Leona, 36, has now confirmed the news, sharing a picture on social media of herself in a chic black cut-out dress, beaming while revealing her bump for the first time. ‘Can’t wait to meet you in the Summer,’ she wrote in the caption, alongside a heart emoji. Her Instagram followers immediately rushed to congratulate her, including stars among the likes of Cynthia Erivo, songwriter Leland and singer Snoh Aalegra. ‘Ohhhh congratulations dears!!!’ a fan commented, while another wrote: ‘Omgggg congrats to you and Dennis 😍❤️❤️ You’ll be amazing parents.’ A source recently told The Sun that Leona and Dennis were ‘over the moon’ that she is pregnant. ‘They have passed the 12-week milestone and told their family and friends at the beginning of the year,’ they said. ‘They can’t wait to welcome their new arrival and to become a family of three.’ Leona has been with her partner Dennis, a professional dancer and choreographer, since 2010. The couple were married in Tuscany, Italy in 2019, with the ceremony taking place at an estate owned by musician Sting. Leona first found fame in 2006 after winning the third series of The X Factor, winning a £1 million recording contract with Syco Music. In December last year, she celebrated 15 years since her victory in a moving post, saying that it ‘all feels like yesterday’. Sharing a picture of herself singing on stage, she wrote: ‘I look at this girl on stage and can’t believe it’s been 15 years. It all feels like yesterday. ‘To my fans all over the world who have supported me from my X Factor days to now – I am forever grateful, you have made my wildest dreams come true! Love you all so much x.’ Got a story?
