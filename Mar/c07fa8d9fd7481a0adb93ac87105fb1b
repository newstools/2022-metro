 This is the horrifying moment a monkey snatches a passing seagull from his enclosure at Chester Zoo and smashes it to death. Bec Adamson, 32, was enjoying a ‘lovely day out’ with her five-year-old son Dominik when she saw the monkey scale a tall pole and turn into ‘King Kong’. She began filming as it suddenly caught the bird by its head and repeatedly slammed it against the side of the pole. The seagull goes limp after the five-minute battering and the monkey appears to lick blood off its fingers. Bec said the monkey then dropped it and quickly climbed down to grab the ‘insides’ from the carcass. The mum-of-one from Northwich, Cheshire, now fears she’s ‘raising a psychopath’ as Dominik was not disturbed in the slightest. ‘Dominik asked if David Attenborough was watching because we watch this sort of thing at home. He just thought it was amazing because he thought they were fighting,’ she said. ‘It could have scarred him for life. If I was his age, I’d have been terrified. I think I’m raising a psychopath.’ She added: ‘It was like watching the real King Kong. He was really slamming it against the pole and pulling at its feathers. It was just really aggressive and mad. ‘We’d just been to see the rhinos, so we were walking across, then I saw all these seagulls circling and then this monkey caught one as it was flying past. It was really clever. ‘Dominik looked too, so I started filming. When I zoomed in I could see he was battering the f*** out of this seagull. I couldn’t believe I was catching it on video. ‘Other people started watching too and suddenly there were about 100 people watching. It was really violent, but it’s what happens in nature.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
