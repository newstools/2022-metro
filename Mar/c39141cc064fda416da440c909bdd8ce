A pedestrian is dead and a man in his fifties is fighting for his life following a car crash in north-west London. Another man has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving, after a white BMW smashed into a house in Neasden last night. The driver, in his fourties, was taken to hospital where his condition was described as ‘non life-threatening’. The man fighting for his life in hospital was a passenger in the car. Police did not release further details about the pedestrian’s identity – other than him being a man in his 30s – but did say they were trying to trace his family, who are thought to be based abroad. They added that he was pronounced dead at the scene. The car crashed into the house on the the eastbound A406, the North Circular Road, after colliding with the pedestrian, and caused significant structural damage to the property. Detectives are appealing for witnesses and dashcam footage. The Metropolitan Police has said ‘enquiries are ongoing to trace (the victim’s) family, believed to be overseas’. Lane closures were in place on the A406 while emergency workers remove the car and make sure the building is safe. Police are appealing for anyone with any information about the incident to call the Serious Collision Investigation Unit on 020 8246 9820, ref 7729/11mar.
