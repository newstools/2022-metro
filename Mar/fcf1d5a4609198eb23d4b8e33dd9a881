Jurgen Klopp insists he will speak to Harvey Elliott after the 18-year-old held a flare during Liverpool’s Carabao Cup final celebrations at Wembley. Elliott was brought on as a substitute in the second half and scored his penalty in the shootout as Liverpool edged past Chelsea in a dramatic final. But the Football Association has now written to Harvey Elliott for his ‘observations’ after he was seen celebrating with a red flare – an item which is banned from all stadiums. Klopp concedes that Elliott made a ‘mistake’ by picking up the flare but has defended the midfielder over his actions by saying that he just got carried away during the celebrations with his teammates. ‘I didn’t speak to Harvey yet, since I’ve been aware of it I couldn’t speak to him,’ Klopp said on Tuesday. ‘Will I speak to him? Yes, but Harvey is very young man and on the pitch, and outside, he’s still a little bit more a boy. ‘But that’s not a problem, he made a mistake, because of the responsibility of a role model, the role we have as people working in public, yeah, I understand 100 per cent, I will tell him, I can promise he will not do it again. ‘Do I think it was the worse thing that ever happened in the world of football? No. But I understand 100 per cent why it’s not okay. ‘But in that moment [even] I got carried away and I’m maybe four times as old as he is, so that can happen. ‘The best thing about making a mistake is not doing it again and he will not do it again.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
