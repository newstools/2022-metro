US President Joe Biden has authorised an additional $200million in weapons and other assistance for Ukraine. The White House’s announcement comes as heavy shelling by Russian forces endangers civilians trying to evacuate besieged cities. The decision brings total US security aid provided to Ukraine to $1.2billion since January 2021. Washington has now provided $3.2billion since 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea region of Ukraine, according to senior administration officials. In a memorandum to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Biden directed that up to $200million allocated through the Foreign Assistance Act be designated for Ukraine’s defence. The funds can be used for weapons and other defense articles from the Defense Department’s stock, as well as military education and training to help Ukraine against invading Russian forces. The Pentagon had no immediate comment on the additional aid and what types of weapons would be included. Ukraine has been asking for more Javelin anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to shoot down aircraft. Today Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, underscored Ukraine’s need for additional military supplies in an interview with the non-profit Renew Democracy Initiative. The United States has drawn from weapons stocks to supply Ukraine repeatedly, beginning in the autumn of 2021 and then again in December and February. The last batch of weapons provided by the United States in February included anti-armour, small arms, body armour and various munitions in support of Ukraine’s front-line defenders, according to the Pentagon, as well as anti-aircraft systems. On Thursday night the U.S. Congress approved $13.6billion in emergency aid for Ukraine as part of a $1.5trillion measure to fund the US government through September.
