Witnesses have described watching in horror as a 200,000-ton cargo ship bore down on a man in an inflatable dinghy. Video of the near miss off the coast Southampton, in Hampshire, shows the man leaping overboard and swimming for his life. It’s understood the engine on his Rigid Inflatable Boat had broken – right in the path of the enormous Al Zubara container ship. An onlooker aboard a nearby ferry described ‘feeling sick’ as he watched the man ‘getting sucked back’ into the ship’s wake while trying to escape. But the man was hauled from the water at the last minute by two men in another dinghy. The near miss reportedly took place in the main shipping channel soon after the Al Zubara set off on its way to Le Havre in France. ‘He obviously didn’t see it coming,’ said student Eden East, who took the video. ‘I thought to myself “he’s a bit brave”. ‘Once he did see it you could see him start panicking and trying to start the engine on his dinghy – but it wouldn’t start so just jumped in,’ Eden said. ‘I’m not sure how he made it. His boat got sucked under and was thrown up on the other side. ‘I was really scared for this guy.’ The Harbour Authority for Southampton Water said the man was recovered by a patrol boat and taken to hospital after treatment for shock. It said it was ‘investigating a near miss involving a large container ship and a small RIB’. Eden said the Red Funnel car ferry he was travelling on had to stop and carry out person overboard procedures. A spokesperson for ferry firm said the crew onboard Red Osprey was ready with a rescue boat, but their help was not needed. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
