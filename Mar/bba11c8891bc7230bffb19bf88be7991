The mother of a 17-month-old baby killed by the family’s pet dog has paid tribute to her ‘blue-eyed girl’. Bella-Rae Birch was attacked at home in Merseyside just a week after they bought the pet. Neighbours in Blackbrook, St Helens, tried to save the toddler – but she died from her injuries in hospital on Monday. The family are now raising money to help pay for Bella-Rae’s funeral. Mum Treysharn Bates wrote on the GoFundMe page: ‘On March 21 we sadly lost our gorgeous blue-eyed baby girl. ‘We are now in a position where we need to raise funds towards the most beautiful send-off. ‘Every little will help, every little is appreciated. Thank you everyone’. Merseyside Police said Bella-Rae had died in the most ‘unimaginably terrible circumstances’. Emergency services were called just before 4pm on Monday, and neighbours gave CPR  until paramedics arrived. Superintendent Steve Brizell said the toddler’s death had ‘left a family and a community grieving and in complete shock.’ Police said the dog – an American Bully XL – has been put down. Officers have been trying to identify its previous owners and establish the animal’s history. The force said the breed was legal and not subject to any prohibitions under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. Four dog breeds are banned in the UK: Pitbull Terriers, Japanese Tosas, Dogo Argentinos and Fila Brasileiros. A spokesperson said police inquiries are ongoing and the family is being supported by specialist officers. In a statement earlier this week, Bella-Rae’s relatives thanked the community for their support. They said: ‘We would ask that we are now allowed some space and time to try and come to terms with the tragic loss of our much-loved Bella-Rae. ‘She will be sadly missed but never forgotten.’ You can help the family pay for Bella-Rae’s funeral here.
