Photos of body bags piled beside living hospital patients have sent shockwaves across the world. Hong Kong is battling with a massive Covid outbreak, with medical staff struggling to cope with rising numbers of cases. Images of six bodies on stretchers at the overwhelmed Queen Elizabeth Hospital were shared on social media today. It is thought that the photo was taken in early March. Patients have reportedly been left waiting outside for hours as staff work to find space to treat them. Sara Ho, chief manager of the Hospital Authority, told the Hong Kong Free Press the ‘body bag’ situation had since been resolved. Explaining that ‘sometimes bodies cannot be transferred to the mortuary in time’, she said: ‘We hope everyone could be understanding [about how] public hospitals have done their best to use more manpower to handle this situation. We are very sorry for causing discomfort to patients.’ Refrigerated containers have also been brought into hospitals to relieve overburdened mortuaries. Hong Kong had managed to keep Covid cases low until this year, when the highly transmissible Omicron variant took hold. Only around 53% of people over the age of 80 had been vaccinated, leading to high numbers of hospital admissions. Many elderly people had fears over side effects from the vaccine. The Omicron variant went on to cripple hospitals and shut down businesses throughout the city. In January, 2,000 hamsters from pet shops were ordered to be ‘disposed of’ after an outbreak was linked to one where 11 pet rodents tested positive. Now, Hong Kong is reporting the highest Covid death rate in the world. The city reported 29,381 Covid-19 infections today and, as of yesterday, there has been 3,150 deaths caused by the pandemic.
