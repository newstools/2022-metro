Paul Pogba’s family home was burgled while the Manchester United midfielder was playing in the Champions League on Wednesday night. The midfielder says the intruders were in his home ‘for less than five minutes’ while his children were asleep in their bedrooms. The break-in took place while Pogba and United were in action against Atletico Madrid with the Spanish champions eliminating them from the Champions League in the process. Pogba’s wife Zulay was also in attendance at Old Trafford. The France international is offering a reward for anyone who can provide information over the incident. Pogba wrote: ‘Last night our family’s worst nightmare was realized when our home was broken into and burglarized while our babies were sleeping in their bedroom. ‘The burglars were in our home for less than five minutes but in that time they took from us something more valuable than anything we had in our home… our sense of safety and security. “This occurred during the final minutes of last night’s match when they knew that we would not be home. ‘My wife and I rushed home not knowing if our children were safe and unharmed. ‘As a father there is no feeling worse in this world than not being there to protect your children and I sincerely hope that no one ever has to feel what I felt last night. ‘It is for this reason that I would like to offer a reward for anyone who has a clue to help us.
