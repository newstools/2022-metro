Meet Llew, a gorgeously fluffy cat who’s been waiting in a shelter to find his perfect home for 324 days. Could you be his perfect match? At the ripe old age of 15, Llew is described as ‘a character’, and ‘a nice boy but on his terms’. That means he’ll happily stroll up to people for strokes, but if you don’t deliver this to his exact specifications, he’ll let you know. The old codger came into the RSPCA’s care as a stray via a vet practice. He’s after a retirement home where he can pretty much be left to do his own thing and live out his twilight years in peace, with plenty of toys to play with. There are a couple of reasons Llew has been skipped over by potential pet parents for months on end. For one, he’s an older boy, and many people simply won’t consider an elderly cat. A crying shame, if you ask us. Secondly, he looks a little different thanks to a cleft lip – but this doesn’t cause him any issues and we think he’s absolutely beautiful. And finally, he has a thyroid issue, which means he’ll need to be on medication for the rest of his life. Llew will also need to have a blood test at the vets twice a year – with sedation, as he’s not particularly fond of this. All of this means that Llew needs an experienced cat owner who won’t be put off by his specific needs, in a home with no other animals or children. In return, though, you’d get a lovely feline friend with glorious fur (which will need brushing) and a quirky personality. If you reckon you could give Llew the home he’s been waiting so long for, you can get in touch with Llys Nini Animal Centre through their website. Do you have a story to share?
