Emile Smith Rowe has missed Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Watford on Sunday after testing positive for Covid. The 21-year-old was absent for Arsenal’s 2-1 win over Wolves on February 24 due to illness but has returned to training after missing that game. However, the midfielder was not named in Mikel Arteta’s matchday squad for his side’s trip to Vicarage Road on Sunday. Arsenal have confirmed that Smith Rowe misses the match due to Covid, while defender Takehiro Tomiyasu is absent once again due to a calf injury. ‘Unfortunately, yes, Emile was extremely down yesterday because obviously he had some niggles after he was sick last week and now he’s got Covid,’ Arteta said of Smith Rowe’s absence on Sunday. ‘But it’s what happened. We have to react and get him back as soon as possible because we need him in the team.’ Arteta’s side could move to fourth place in the Premier League with a win over Watford as they currently sit two points behind Manchester United with three games in hand. United, meanwhile, are in action later on Sunday as they face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium. Speaking about Arsenal’s top-four hopes before the game, Arteta said: ‘I think it’s positive because we want to be playing and the reality is that we are not fourth, we are sixth still and if we win those games – and we have to win those games – we know what we have to do to get there. ‘It is a long way to go, to focus and the only aim is to win against Watford.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
