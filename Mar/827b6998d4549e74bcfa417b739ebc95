First Dates star Merlin Griffiths has thanked fans for their support as he prepares for bowel cancer surgery. Merlin is a huge favourite with viewers as the chatty bar man in the First Dates restaurant, calming guests’ nerves as they await the arrival of what could be the love of their lives. Back in September, Merlin confirmed he’d been diagnosed with bowel cancer after going to hospital with symptoms including bloating and nausea, before the stage three tumour, measuring 4.5cm in length, was detected. Updating followers on his progress, Merlin tweeted: ‘Operation scheduled. 3 weeks to get my sh*t together. Robotic surgery, welcome to the future!’ He added:’ Thank you to everyone wishing me well. X  May your lives be prosperous and filled with empathy and happiness.’ Naturally, fans were eager to send their well-wishes, with one posting: ‘You have got this!!’ ‘Wishing you lots and lots of luck. Stay strong, you’ll beat this bugger x,’ wrote another. Merlin publicially confirmed his diagnosis in September 2021, explaining he thought his stomach pains were caused by an injury he suffered years ago. At the time, he told the Mirror: ‘I’m keeping that positive outlook, but I’ve a morbid sense of humour. I tell people, ‘I have colorectal cancer… it’s a real pain in the a**e.’ He also recalled telling his seven-year-old daughter about his diagnosis. ‘I said, “Yes, it’s very serious but I think it should be OK. Modern medicine’s great and if anything changes I’ll let you know.” ‘She understands that people can die but I told her cancer comes in different varieties and in different ways too – and that many people come through it.’ First Dates airs Thursdays at 10pm on Channel 4.
