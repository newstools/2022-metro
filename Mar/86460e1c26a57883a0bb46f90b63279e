A fire has erupted at the Richard Attenborough stage at Pinewood Studios. Six fire engines were reportedly scrambled to the famous movie studio in Berkshire after witnesses heard ‘explosions’. The blaze is believed to have broken out during the filming of Snow White. ‘A set made up of a lot of wood, and trees etc was currently being built in the Richard Attenborough stage,’ an anonymous source told The Sun. ‘Rumour is a piece of set has caught light and spread across the rest of the set. ‘Six fire engines from local stations have arrived and are currently tackling the fire. ‘Some crew in the studio were shaken but evacuated without injury apparently.’ Rachel Zegler is starring as Snow White in the new live action remake of Disney’s iconic film, due out next year. It’s not yet known if any actors were filming scenes when the fire broke out, but Zegler was in London for last night’s Bafta Film Awards. There have been several fires at Pinewood over the years, with the set burning down during the filming of Ridley Scott’s Legend in 1984. Another fire broke out after production ended on the James Bond film Casino Royale in 2006. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
