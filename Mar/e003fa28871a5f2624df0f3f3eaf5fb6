Hacktivist group Anonymous has struck again and this time it has targeted Russia’s government websites – including its national security agency. The decentralised organisation posted on Twitter the names of Russian websites it attacked and successfully brought down with screenshots as proof. ‘Tango Down’ it said it the tweet, invoking military slang announcing an enemy has been defeated in combat. Among the sites that the hacker collective claimed to have taken down include Moscow.ru, Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), Analytical Center for the Government of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Sport of the Russian Federation. The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation is the principal security agency of Russia and the main successor agency to the Soviet Union’s KGB. Analytical Center for the Government of the Russian Federation is a Russian think tank publishing ‘expert views on a wide range of socio-economic development issues of the country’. In a subsequent tweet, Anonymous leaked a correspondence between Russuan president Putin and Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu that outlines plans to cut down and sell Ukrainian forests. The letter, allegedly from Shoigu, is titled ‘On the possibility of felling on defense lands’ and is personally addressed to Putin, said Anonymous in the tweet and included a translation. The hacker collective which has been bombarding Russia with multiple cyber attacks signed off today’s series of tweets with a Russian expletive saying, ‘Blyat Putin!’ MORE : Anonymous hacks Russian streaming services to broadcast footage of the war MORE : Anonymous is waging cyber war on Russia – how effective could they be?
