Cristiano Ronaldo did not put a date on when he plans to retire from football, but insisted that it will be no one’s decision but his when the time does come. The 37-year-old is preparing for a huge game on Tuesday as Portugal meet North Macedonia for a place in the World Cup later this year. If Ronaldo can get to Qatar with his country then he will be only the fourth male player in history to play at five World Cups, something he would love to have on his CV. If disaster struck and Portugal suffered a shock loss to the North Macedonians then might not be the end for him at international level, with the Manchester United star not clear, but bullish on his future. ‘Who will decide my future will be me,’ he said. ‘If I feel like playing more, I will. I’m the boss, end of story.’ The legendary forward was in a pumped up mood ahead of the big game and insisted that his side will not be falling into the same trap as Italy. The European champions were stunned by North Macedonia in the previous round but Ronaldo says that surprise will not be sprung again. ‘Macedonia surprised everyone but they will not surprise us,’ he said. ‘Portugal will be better and go to the World Cup.’ The veteran called on the Portuguese fans to be as loud as they were during the 3-1 win over Turkey last week, which saw them set up this clash on Tuesday night. ‘I would like to sing our national anthem without music,’ Ronaldo said. ‘If they are like they were on Thursday I’m sure we will win.’ MORE : Wayne Rooney calls ex-Manchester United teammate Cristiano Ronaldo ‘annoying’, Rio Ferdinand ‘arrogant’ and says Carlos Tevez was his ‘biggest disappointment’ MORE : Cristiano Ronaldo set to miss out on £5m after Manchester United’s ‘season from hell’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
