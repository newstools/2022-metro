Harry Potter star Jessie Cave has given birth, she and her partner, comedian Alfie Bowen, announced as they celebrated their new arrival. Earlier this month, the actress – who played Lavender Brown in the fantasy film franchise – was admitted to hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, sharing that the virus hit her ‘like a tonne of bricks’. In a new post on Instagram, she revealed that she and Alfie have named their newborn Becker Brown. Sharing a picture of herself breastfeeding and another of Alfie holding the baby, the couple wrote in the caption: ‘Welcome Becker Brown. Thank you to UCLH. Thank you to the midwives Amy and Emi-Lou. Thank you to Alisson Becker.’ It appears that Jessie and Alfie may have taken inspiration from footballer Alisson Becker when naming their child, including a picture of the Liverpool goalkeeper in their announcement. The couple have four children together, with a son born in October 2014, a daughter born in July 2016 and another son born in October 2020. Jessie and Alfie were immediately inundated with messages of congratulations over the new addition to their family, with one Instagram user commenting: ‘Congrats guys on another beautiful tiny human.’ ‘Congratulations ❤️ to you and your beautiful family,’ someone else said, while another person wrote: ‘Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉 hope you’re all doing well.’ After it was recently revealed that Jessie had contracted coronavirus, she reassured fans that she was doing alright, writing on social media: ‘I’m actually okay, just weak and not myself and it’s not ideal timing obviously. I think my body is still recovering from covid & norovirus back to back….’ The 34-year-old previously shared a picture of herself in hospital, writing: ‘Triage, once again…… Anyone else had covid in 3rd trimester & had it hit them like a tonne of bricks for weeks?’ Jessie shared that she was pregnant in December last year, sharing a picture online of her baby bump. At the time, she told her followers: ‘Can’t hide this new baby anymore.’ The actress and comedian’s older children are named Donnie, Margot and Tenn, with Tenn having originally been named Abraham ‘Bam’ before the couple decided to change his name. As well as her role in the Harry Potter films, Jessie is also known for her comedic play Sunrise, based on her life, as well as her cartoon doodles, which she published in a book called Love Sick.
