Harry Potter star Jessie Cave has been taken to hospital after testing positive for Covid-19, during the third trimester of her pregnancy. The actress, who played Lavender Brown in the wizarding franchise, confirmed that she is pregnant with her fourth child, with partner Alfie Brown, last year. Taking to Instagram, the 34-year-old shared an update on her baby journey, posting a photo from her hospital bed. ‘Triage, once again……,’ she penned beside the snap. ‘Anyone else had covid in 3rd trimester & had it hit them like a tonne of bricks for weeks?’ Co-star Devon Murray – who played Seamus Finnigan in the Potter flicks – was among the stars who offered their well wishes to the expectant mum. ‘Jessie, I’m so sorry you’re going through this now. Hoping for a speedy recovery,’ he commented. Felicity Ward replied: ‘Oh honey. I’m so sorry. Like your body hasn’t got enough to deal with. ‘Sending you lots of love lovely.’ Sara Pascoe added: ‘Oh Jessie I’m so sorry this is rotten.’ In a message shared on her Instagram story, Jessie later added: ‘Also – has anyone taken the anti-nausea drug and it made them feel worse?’ Jessie announced her pregnancy news last December, posting the first photo of her baby bump. The actress told followers at the time: ‘Can’t hide this new baby anymore.’ She also shares children Donnie and Margot, with the comedian, with the couple adding to their brood with little Tenn in 2020. The tot was born in October and was originally named Abraham ‘Bam’ before the couple announced that they had changed his name to Tenn shortly after. Got a story?
