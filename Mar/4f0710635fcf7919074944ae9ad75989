Burger King’s Leicester Square store is reopening next week, but with a twist: it’s going to be completely plant-based. Open for a month, the store will not only will make eating vegan easier than ever, it will also help to lower the US food chain’s emissions. Plus, BK said it will keep an eye on popular menu items to potentially bring them to the national stage. As well as the already available Vegan Royale, Vegan Nuggets, and Plant Based Whopper, the vegan BK store will have a number of exclusive new dishes, including Vegan Chilli Cheeeze Bites and the Plant-based Double Bakon Cheeezeburger. There’ll also be a Cheeeze & Bakon burger as well as a Bakon Double Cheeeze XL and a Vegan Cheeeze & Bakon Royale along with a fully plant-based kids menu and the newly-launched limited edition vegan Katsu range. Katie Evans, from Burger King UK, said: ‘We’re incredibly proud of our new meat-free menu; it absolutely delivers on big taste with no compromises and reflects our ongoing commitment to serving our customers a diverse and innovative range of products. ‘The limited-edition menu is a direct result of our focus on vegan and plant-based innovation and goes hand in hand with our target of a 50 per cent meat-free menu by 2030, as well as our commitment to sustainability and responsible business. ‘We can’t think of a more fitting way to re-launch our new-look flagship in Leicester Square.’ Be quick, though: the store is only open for a month, from March 13 to April 10.
