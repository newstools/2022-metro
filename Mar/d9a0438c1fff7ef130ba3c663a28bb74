You are about to have a spring in your step if you are a soap fan as, along with the sunshine and Pimms, there are some blockbuster stories ahead. Metro.co.uk has revealed so much over the last few months that it’s hard to keep up. So what is more handy than a big guide to everything coming up in Coronation Street, EastEnders and Emmerdale over coming months? Nothing, that’s what. From a big return to Walford to big exits in Weatherfield and the Dales, we also have dead bodies, shocking stunts, heartbreaking illnesses and a funeral with lots of drama. Okay, it might not be as bright and happy as the daffodils and lambs, but this is soap and we will be glued to our seats. Grad that Pimms and let’s go! Stuart’s cancer journey Stuart (Ricky Champ) has been breaking all of our hearts; his fear around confronting his cancer has led him to bury his head in the sand and be brainwashed into believing spiritual and holistic approaches will cure his disease. Rainie (Tanya Franks) is desperate to help her husband, terrified of losing him. Their dream of becoming parents is almost fulfilled when Bernie gives birth but when the surrogate then discovers the truth, she is reluctant to be a part of bringing a baby into such a situation. Things are going to get very complicated as Bernie’s own feelings over the baby she gave birth to drive her into turmoil, while Stuart has to make his life changing decision once and for all. Clair Norris, who plays Bernie, recently told Metro.co.uk: ‘It is a rollercoaster for Bernie, there’s a lot of back and forth with what she’s going to do and in the end what does she do. ‘You’ve been carrying a baby for nine months and you don’t want to get attached, there’s the aftermath of it all and her feeling lonely, wanting to get on with her life but she’s got such big decisions to make. ‘With all the dark there’s a light at the end. She finds a new friendship with somebody on the Square and they build this whole friendship up. So there is a light at the end of the tunnel.’ Sam is back – and chaos follows! The news that Kim Medcalf was reclaiming the role of Sam Mitchell gave nostalgic Albert Square fans a real thrill – and yep, I count myself among them. Sam is a Mitchell and this is a faaaaamily that never comes without chaos. Phil (Steve McFadden) is in Jail, Sharon (Letitia Dean) and Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) are trying to hold everything together and struggling Ben (Max Bowden) is heading for a crisis. So can Sam support her family – it is she going to be focusing on causing huge amounts of chaos for those she left behind – not least of all Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), the father of her child Ricky? BBC Head of Continuing Drama Kate Oates reacted to the Sam Mitchell news: ‘I have long wanted to bring Sam back into the family fold. Her return is guaranteed to be explosive.’ We would expect nothing less. Linda vs Janine after Tina’s funeral Super schemer Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) has been growing closer to landlord of The Vic Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) and while my initial outrage was palpable, I’m kind of here for it. We have seen a new side to Janine and I reckon she and Mick’s scenes have been hitting the right note; perhaps they are a good match after all. Safe to say that Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is unlikely to agree and pictures from location filming show Tina’s funeral descend into chaos. A drunk Linda comes to blows with Janine but this seems like it will only push Mick further away. And we also have the news that I still refuse to accept – Mick is leaving. So are both of his relationships doomed? The thought of losing both Janine and Linda too is not even worth considering so it seems to be the case. Danny spoke about the nature of his exit recently, enthusing: ‘We’ve just been pitched my leaving storyline. ‘It’s going to be epic. It’s huge.’ Jean spirals out of control No-one has been more concerned about Jean Slater’s (Gillian Wright) erratic behaviour as her mental health has taken a hit once more than Stacey (Lacey Turner) Well, except viewers obvs. Jean’s decision making has been very off, with her telling the children about the grim details of Kush’s death and also rushing into a very all over the place relationship with Harvey Monroe (Ross Boatman). Things are only going to get worse as Jean’s loved ones struggle to support her with her manic episode of her bipolar disorder. Terrifying new pics show Jean submerging herself in the ocean, complete with wedding dress. Thank our lucky stars that Stacey and Martin (James Bye) are on hand to pull her to safety but it’s a clear indication that poor Jean is in a very bad place and really needs serious help to get through this. Gary’s life in turmoil as Rick is found Gary Windass (Mikey North) is about to have his life turned upside down and inside out after the discovery of Rick Neelan’s body. Thought you’d got away with that one, didn’t you Gary? After confessing to dying Laura (Kel Allen), Gary fears it’s only a matter of time before he is in the slammer. And worse, he could face the disgust and agony of Kelly (Millie Gibson) if she finds out what he did to her dad. So is Gary heading for the slammer? Well if he is, at least he gets to pay his, uh, respects at the funeral of Rick. By getting into a fist fight, the very thing that caused Rick to die. Is the time up for Gary? Imran and Abi at war – but what about Toyah? Abi (Sally Carman) and Imran (Charlie de Melo) have that shared secret that they have a baby together – Toyah (Georgia Taylor) has no idea that her partner was with Abi, thinking his one night stand was a one off mistake with a stranger. Poor oblivious Toyah is being there as a support for Abi right now, but with a battle for their son brewing, Imran and Abi will cross swords in a dramatic way but who will come out on top? And how will Toyah react when she learns the agonising truth? Show producer Iain MacLeod teased the explosive ramifications ahead, telling Metro.co.uk: ‘Abi is someone used to finding herself in a pickle and 2022 will continue in that vain. It’s a really challenging year, she could lose Kevin and Jack and she will be caught in a David and Goliath legal battle. ‘It threatens to destroy Imran and Toyah’s relationship as Toyah does not know the full truth. It tests the bounds of Toyah’s forgiveness to the max. ‘Imran is forced to look in a mirror and consider himself and the man who he is – he could go to the dark side.’ He continued: ‘It’s a big buried bomb just waiting for people to end up in the blast radius. It won’t be for months but the way it happens is very surprising. ‘It’s big and shocking and it’s the last thing you’d expect from something this way. It turns into a gobsmacking cataclysm. ‘It’s intimate but the shock will make people fall off their chairs. It’s no secret that Sally is a fantastic actor, rightly awarded, so it’s exciting to keep her and draw in Mike, Georgie, Charlie. Smack them in the middle of something colossal.’ And the big events look set to send Imran out of Weatherfield for good as it has been confirmed that he is leaving the show. Excited to see how he goes – but personally gutted if I am honest! Emma needs to get out – will it be happy ever after? The start of the year was quite a rocky ride for Emma (Alexandra Mardell) and Faye (Ellie Leach) – pretty much literally. They ran over a pensioner Ted and, rather bizarrely, tried their best to cover the death up. It’s not exactly been henady that Faye is with a police officer Craig (Colson Smith) and with the evidence mounting up, the bombshell could explode at any time. Emma loves to complicate a situation and is now dating the son of Ted. So when she is offered a new life, her unlucky in love heart leaps. But with the truth threatening to emerge, will she get her happy ever after or be heading to prison? Speaking of her departure, the actress said: ‘Playing Emma, on the most iconic street there is, has been the best experience of my life. ‘Four years have gone so fast. I can’t thank everyone at Coronation Street enough for welcoming me and trusting me to tell so many wonderful and heartfelt ­stories.’ A tragic time ahead for struggling Summer It’s been so heartbreaking seeing teenager Summer Spellman (Matilda Freeman) going through body image issues all the while coping with her diabetes diagnosis. All she wants is to have a normal life as a youngster, including friendships, nights out and and not having to think too much about her illness. But aside from that strain, she is also loathing how she looks and taking extremely dangerous methods to try and control her weight. The despairing teen has been secretly suffering from bulimia and we have also seen her toying with her insulin intake. Her life is at serious risk but as someone finds out what she is going through, can they get through to her? The journey has a long way to go and it could go either way for her. Let’s hope against hope that tragedy is not around the corner. Meena’s last stand – will she go down? It would be hard to summarise the story of Meena Jutla (Paige Sandhu) so I’m not even going to try – suffice to say, her rampage has been out of control and impacted many of the village residents. All of you ‘omg when is this going to end?’ folk can breathe a sigh of relief as Meena is about to get her comeuppance – and all of you who are loving it, make the most of the Queen of Meen(a). Her court case is ahead and Manpreet (Rebecca Sarker) will decide to face her sister, something which delights Meena, who sees this all as a game. But her future hangs in the balance; with around 25 crimes on her list, it can’t be possible for her to escape justice. However, if you expect her to go down with any kind of fuss, you obviously don’t know Meena. The stage is set for a thrilling climax and as we all wonder what Meena’s fate is – and whether she will destroy another victim in the process – the lady herself is plotting in her cell, no doubt excited for a final roll of the dice. Can Marlon get on the road to recovery? There hasn’t been a dry eye in the country as we have watched with agony the aftermath of Marlon Dingle’s (Mark Charnock) stroke. It is going to be a long and hard road to a recovery, and even that is not a promised outcome. As Marlon feels helpless and broken in his state, it is impacting the loved ones around him as well as the Dingle family as a whole. Rhona Goskirk (Zoe Henry) is doing her very best to deal with things as best she can but the pressure mounts, delivering her the most difficult circumstances of her life. And things are only going to get worse for devastated best friend Paddy Kirk. Dominic Brunt told Metro.co.uk: ‘It’s the person that he loves, and he relies on Marlon to play a certain role in his life, so when that’s taken away, it frightens him. ‘Marlon might not be the person that he was and that completely spins him out. He just wants Marlon back, and it really frightens him that he’s going to wake up and that it’s going to be his body and his face, but not Marlon. ‘Friendship or any kind of support, they’ve always been there for each other for 25 years. So, Paddy’s thinking all of a sudden he might not be there. He’s terrified.’ Will Kim discover the truth about ‘dead’ Jamie? We all know that Jamie Tate somehow survived the smash into the lake while driving his land rover but Kim Tate (Claire King) remains unaware of the fate of her son. Accepting that he is dead, Kim’s focus is now purely on the family she has left, not least of all her grandchild of Gabby Thomas (Rosie Bentham). But show bosses have suggested that bombshells are on the way for the Queen of Home Farm. Show boss Laura Shaw teased Metro.co.uk: ‘Up at Home Farm we know that Jamie Tate is actually still alive so obviously that info is still to come out – and what will Kim do once she knows? ‘We know what a tough cookie Kim is but we also know that Jamie is her Achilles heel so we can expect huge fireworks if she ever finds out how much he has betrayed her.’ Cain and Al may end in tragedy You know, I’d never like to be in the middle of Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) and his violent feud with Al Chapman (Michael Wildman) – all of that toxic testosterone and endless grudges. No, thank you. But yes, it is going to get far worse, with bosses promising a special week which will throw a disastrous new chapter in the war. And there have been pictures released which show a potentially fatal car crash. Boss Jane Hudson told us: ‘I think we can probably tease in our special week that Cain and Al’s feud is definitely not over, as we will see in that special week, and something will happen that will make those two have to look at their relationship with each other. ‘So, there’s definitely going to be an explosive Cain/Al moment in our special week. I think the audience are really enjoying these two men constantly at war.’ MORE : 12 soap spoiler pictures: Coronation Street baby daddy exposed, Emmerdale stroke aftermath, EastEnders cancer news, Hollyoaks public enemy MORE : Emmerdale’s Adam Thomas’ son Teddy joins Waterloo Road
