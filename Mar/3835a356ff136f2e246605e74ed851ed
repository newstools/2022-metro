President Joe Biden will travel to Brussels next week for a meeting with NATO leaders to show US support for Ukraine following Russia’s invasion, the White House confirmed Tuesday. Biden will jet off to Brussels on March 24 for a NATO Summit ‘to discuss ongoing deterrence and defense efforts in response to Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine, as well as to reaffirm our ironclad commitment to or NATO allies,’ White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. On the trip he will also join in on a scheduled European Council summit to discuss shared concerns about Ukraine, according to Psaki. ‘While he’s there, his goal is to meet in person face-to-face with his European counterparts and talk about, assess where we are at this point in the conflict in the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. We’ve been incredibly aligned to date,’ Psaki said. ‘That doesn’t happen by accident. The president is a big believer in face-to-face diplomacy. So it’s an opportunity to do exactly that.’ The trip follows Vice President Kamala Harris’ visit to Poland and Romania last week, where she met with leaders over the growing refugee crisis in eastern Europe sparked by the Russian invasion. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg tweeted earlier on Tuesday: ‘We will address #Russia’s invasion of #Ukraine, our strong support for Ukraine, and further strengthening NATO’s deterrence & defense. At this critical time, North America & Europe must continue to stand together.’ This is a breaking news story, check back for updates…
