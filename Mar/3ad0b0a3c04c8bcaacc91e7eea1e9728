This is the shocking moment a fight erupted between a group of masked men armed with machetes and baseball bats on a residential street in Birmingham. The brawl, captured on camera, is thought to have broken out on Monday after a car was vandalised earlier in the day. Video footage shows a masked man hacking at the windows of a white car before four other hooded figures jump out of the vehicle with weapons. The white car’s back window was smashed in the clash, but it is not clear if anyone was injured in the fight, which ended abruptly. A second clip shows the white car being pounded on by three masked men before one makes off to a waiting vehicle and the other two return to the car. Both drivers then flee from the scene, dangerously running a red light at the nearby junction. West Midlands Police said it was aware of the incident and was looking into it. However, no weapons have been found and no one has anyone come forward with injuries. A statement read: ‘We’re investigating a disorder on Willows Road, Balsall Heath, around 2.20pm yesterday. ‘Several men were seen with weapons, including knives, attacking a parked car on the road. Some of the men left in a white Ford Fiesta. ‘Our officers attended and carried out an extensive search of the area, however no weapons were found and the men had dispersed. No-one has come forward with injuries. It added: ‘We are aware of a video circulating on social media, which does look alarming. We want to reassure local residents that we are working harder than ever to establish the full circumstances of this incident and trace the individuals involved..’ Police asked anyone involved or with information of the incident ton come forward and quote crime number 20/280856/22.
