Mother’s Day is just around the corner, and while children’s usual way of showing their love is orange juice and some toast, we reckon it’s time to take things up a notch. How about following up that breakfast in bed with a delicious chocolate chip cookie, made by hand? It’s not as challenging as you might think. SORTEDfood have shared with us their recipe for the best ever chocolate chip cookie – and it’s easy enough for kids to join in. They recommend prepping the dough the day before, so that it can be popped into the oven for a fresh, warm cookie on Mother’s Day. So, how’s it done? Do you have a story to share?
