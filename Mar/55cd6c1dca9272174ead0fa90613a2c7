Kate Middleton turned heads at the Commonwealth Day event wearing a striking royal blue outfit and Princess Diana’s earrings. Accompanied by Prince William at the service in London in Westminster Abbey on Monday afternoon, Kate opted for a bold look of head-to-toe blue. She wore an elegant Catherine Walker coat – finished with incredibly neat tailoring – in a bright cobalt shade. Buttons of the same colour up the front of the garment create a split which showed off a skirt of the same shade underneath. She teamed the statement coat with navy heels, and a Lock & Co hat in a matching blue shade, a Jimmy Choo bag and sapphire jewellery. The diamond and sapphire earrings where inherited from Diana, which we have seen Kate wearing before. Prince Charles, Camilla, Prince William and Kate represented the Queen at the Commonwealth Service today after the 95-year-old monarch missed the event at Westminster Abbey for the first time in nearly a decade.
