The physical and mental benefits of outdoor swimming have really come to light over recent years. And with the pandemic seeing a rise in open water, wild and lido swimming, there’s never been a better time to give it a go. If you’ve already taken it up as a hobby, or plan to, there’s a new outdoor swimming spot that’s opening in the capital very soon – in Ilford, East London, to be exact. Last week, Redbridge Council confirmed that it will be building a brand new outdoor lido in Valentines Park, as part of its no-cuts budget proposals for 2022/23. Valentines Lido originally opened back in the 1920s, but closed in the 90s. So new plans will see the site restored to its former glory – and it seems work is already underway to design the lido to complement the existing landscaping. Redbridge Council has pledged to deliver the new swimming spot as part of an £11 million package aimed at improving the borough’s leisure facilities. It also fits in with this council’s aim to make the area ‘a cleaner, greener, healthier and safer place.’ Elsewhere in the borough of Redbridge, other council proposals include £15 million for a town-centre regeneration, £2 million on public loos, £5 million on street repairs, £16 million on schools and £80 million towards building new, affordable homes. So there’s never been a better time to be a resident of the area. The Valentines Park spot will join the likes of Brockwell Park, Tooting Bec, Parliament Hill, Park Road, London Fields and more, in terms of the capital’s lido offering. Do you have a story to share?
