This is the dramatic moment a passenger was pulled to safety after he fell from a moving train. CCTV showed the man slipping while trying to jump onto a carriage in Mumbai, India. The footage, captured on Sunday, shows an alert Railway Protection Force constable spring into action as the man crashed to the floor. Netrapal Singh dragged him away from the carriage as it passed through Vadala station. The Times of India said Mr Singh saved the man’s life by stopping him falling into the gap between the train and the platform. Regional operator Central Railway tweeted the footage, warning passengers not to board trains in motion. Indian Railways operates around 9,000 trains carrying roughly 23 million passengers every day. In 2020, nearly 12,000 people were killed in more than 13,000 train accidents across the country, according to India’s National Crime Records Bureau. Last month, a motorcyclist in Mumbai dodged death on the tracks. He tried to dart over a level crossing on his bike – but narrowly avoided being mown down by the Rajdhani Express. Footage shows him scrambling away as the train smashes his motorbike to bits, sending sparks and debris flying through the air. In January, nine people died and at least 45 others were injured when a train derailed in West Bengal. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
