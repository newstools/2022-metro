The Anonymous collective appears to have had its servers knocked out by Russian hackers. The vigilante group has been targeting Russian sites and services in response to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Now Russian hackers claim to have struck back by disabling their servers. A Russian group known as Killnet claims it has been able to disrupt Anonymous’ own websites.

Please try again or come back later. 500 Error. Internal Server Error.’ Killnet has added a Russian-language video address, with a shadowy hooded figure against the backdrop of a Russian flag reading out a text. The figure reads the following message: ‘Greetings, Russians and friendly union nations. The internet is full of fake information about the hacking of Russian banks, hacks on Russian media servers, and much more. ‘None of this poses any danger to people. This ‘information bomb’ is merely text and nothing more. Do not fall for fake information on the internet. Have no doubts about your country,’ The Killnet video noted that ‘very soon this conflict will end, and we will find peace.’ Anonymous recently claimed it was able to take down Russian media sites and even compromise the country’s space agency with its most recent attacks.
