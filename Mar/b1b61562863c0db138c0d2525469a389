A lovesick Vietnamese man was rescued after paddling for 18 days on an inflatable boat with no navigation system to reach his wife in India. Ho Hoang Hung, 37, packed drinking water tank, 10 packets of noodles, luggage and plastic flowers for his wife in the 8ft-long dinghy, but no map, compass or GPS. He was 80km off the coast of Phang Nga province, southern Thailand, when passing fishermen noticed him struggling in the Andaman Sea on March 23. The crew helped starving and fatigued man who claimed he was separated from his wife in Mumbai due to Covid-19 restrictions before Thai Navy officers took him in. Ho told officers he was missing his wife and had given up waiting for her to return so he decided to ‘go there myself’. Navy officers confirmed that Ho had travelled from Saigon to Bangkok on March 2, but didn’t have a visa to move on to India. He then took a bus to Phuket, where he bought a rubber dinghy and started paddling on March 5. The planned trip across the Bay of Bengal was not long before the start of cyclone season. It is thought Ho was held up by headwinds, which is why he made limited progress in the two weeks before he was rescued. A Thai Navy spokesperson said: ‘We care about all lives in the Andaman sea. We would like to thank the local fishermen for letting us rescue this man. ‘From our interview, we found that the Vietnamese man planned on rowing the rubber boat to his Indian wife in Mumbai. The couple were married two years ago but had to be separated because of the pandemic.’ Officers took the man to Similan Islands Marine National Park and coordinated with relevant agencies to assist him.
