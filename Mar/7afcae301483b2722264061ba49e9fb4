Heartwarming pictures show Britain’s oldest postman, 98, delivering letters to residents in his care home. Former RAF navigator Ray Stanley wanted to stay active in his old age so decided to give out mail at Upton Bay Care Home in Poole, Dorset. The grandfather-of-two doesn’t officially work for the Royal Mail – but is perfectly dressed for the job after thoughtful staff contacted the local depot to request a uniform. After collecting letters from the postbox outside the care home, he makes his rounds in his wheelchair wearing an embroidered shirt and cap – and even boasts his very own iconic red post bag. Ray, who also worked as a transport consultant, has described his new job as ‘quite a laugh’ and says his favourite part is bringing dementia patients ‘joy’. ‘I came to the home back in November and when they suggested I be the postman I didn’t know what to say’, he said. ‘There’s a postbox down the front and at 1.30pm I go down there and we empty the letters out. ‘Then my wheelchair is wheeled around all the different places and I deliver the letters. I meet a lot of people who probably wouldn’t know me otherwise. ‘I especially enjoy visiting Memory Lane, where people living with dementia are cared for – I feel like I’m bringing them a little bit of joy.’ Unsurprisingly, the Christmas period in December was Ray’s busiest month yet – with more than 100 letters and presents delivered around the care home. Mevin Sohorye, general manager at Upton Bay, said: ’We are so grateful to Royal Mail Poole for their gift to Ray. ‘It truly is a pleasure to be able to fulfil a special wish for a resident.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
