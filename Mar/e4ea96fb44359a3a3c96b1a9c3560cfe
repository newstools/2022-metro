Manchester City have welcomed Ukrainian refugee Andrii Kravchuk to the club to train with their development squad for the rest of the season. Kravchuck had been playing for Torpedo Moscow but terminated his contract when Russia invaded his home country. The 23-year-old is a former teammate of City star Oleksandr Zinchenko from their time in Shakhtar Donetsk’s academy and will be thrilled to link-up with him again after Zinchenko helped to bring him to Manchester. He began training with the Elite Development Squad on Thursday and is set to remain for the rest of the campaign. ‘I haven’t seen Oleks for a while but he has always been helpful for me – even going back to when we were together at Shakhtar,’ Kravchuk said. ‘I’m really happy to be here with him.’ Zinchenko added: ‘While I wish the circumstances were very different, it has been good to be back with Andriy today. ‘I know how much football means to him, and how it can help us during these difficult times. I would like to thank my club for giving him the opportunity to train with us.’ The midfielder is now looking for a new club for next season, but explained that he saw no other way but to leave his previous employers. ‘Leaving the club was the only decision,’ Kravchuk said. ‘I felt really uncomfortable. People in Ukraine would not understand me if I continued to play there. I cannot believe it’s happened. In the 21st century, in the middle of Europe. I still can’t find the words.’ MORE : Steve McClaren likens Manchester United target Erik ten Hag to Alex Ferguson: ‘Tactically he’s outstanding’ MORE : Nemanja Matic makes honest admission over the atmosphere inside the Manchester United dressing room For more stories like this, check our sport page.
