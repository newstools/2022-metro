Former Real Madrid midfielder Guti has criticised Carlo Ancelotti for refusing to play Eden Hazard during the defeat to Barcelona. Madrid remain on course to win La Liga as they have a nine-point lead at the top of the table, but they were hammered 4-0 by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday. Hazard, meanwhile, was left on the bench as his struggles continue since his arrival from Chelsea in 2019. The Belgium international, who joined Madrid for an initial £88.5 million fee, has started just seven La Liga games this season and has failed to score in the league. But Guti believes Ancelotti should have utilised Hazard to help Madrid pull level against Barcelona. ‘I’m Ancelotti and I look at the bench and I have Hazard, Jovic, Bale, Isco… and you’re telling me that I can’t sub any of them in?’ Guti told El Chiringuito. ‘What’s going on? I am getting lost. ‘I watch the game against Barcelona and I see the Real Madrid bench and I find that in the second half the first change from Madrid is Mariano… How can this be? Aren’t Bale and Hazard there? Madrid’s first offensive change Mariano, who hasn’t played this year? ‘Real Madrid cannot just use 12 or 13 players. A big team that wants to fight for the Champions League, for La Liga and for the Copa del Rey cannot use just 14 players. What is happening here? ‘Whoever doesn’t want play, he’s not part of Real Madrid. This is that easy. But now let him say it. ‘The club or Carlo Ancelotti has to tell that player, ‘go to a press conference and say I don’t want to play for Real Madrid’. Real Madrid is paying you… how can you not play?’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
