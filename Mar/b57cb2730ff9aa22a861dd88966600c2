Giving birth is often seen as a miracle but it can also be an anxiety inducing time and a seriously stressful experience. And now one woman has shared her daunting birth story. TikTok user Bethany Collins has revealed how she pushed so hard during childbirth that her eye popped out. In a clip shared on the popular app, the 23-year-old showed viewers a picture of herself at the hospital where her left eye can be seen bulging out of her head. Despite the popping incident, Bethany was blessed with a beautiful baby girl. ‘Now, I have Miss Phoebe,’ she gushed. Thankfully, after six weeks Bethany’s eyes went back to normal and there were no adverse long-term affects. Eyes popping appears to be a rare occurrence but blood vessels bursting in the eyes is extremely common. It happens due to the intense pressure child birth can cause on the body. Fellow mothers in Bethany’s comments shared their similar stories. ‘I popped a bunch of blood vessels in my eyes from pushing so hard,’ commented one viewer. ‘Omg my eyes bled because I pushed so hard. I looked so scary,’ added another. Meanwhile, some joked that Bethany’s story was a new form of birth control. One user quipped: ‘I’m never having a child.’ Do you have a story to share?
