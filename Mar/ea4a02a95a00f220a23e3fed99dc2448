Holly Willoughby represented the majority of us today as she posted a selfie of her enjoying the sunshine, after missing out on presenting duties due to Covid. The 41-year-old TV personality tested positive for the virus last Sunday, which resulted in her missing the Dancing On Ice semi-finals, which she hosts alongside Phillip Schofield. Holly was also replaced by Josie Gibson and Alison Hammond during this week’s installment of This Morning. But judging from her latest Instagram snap, it’s safe to say the star is on the mend, and we’ll be seeing her back on the small screen soon. Holly uploaded a rather zen picture of her basking in the sunlight with a green hedge completing the aesthetic look, and wrote: ‘Just what the doctor ordered.’ Although she appeared to be in good health, fans and fellow celebrities wished her a speedy recovery, nonetheless. Presenter Vanessa Feltz wrote: ‘Glad to see you up and about sweetheart ⭐️💡⭐️.’ While one fan demanded Holly to ‘drop a skincare routine.’ During Tuesday’s edition of the daytime programme, it was explained to viewers that Holly was pretty much over the whole situation. ‘Holly’s obviously still got rona, so sending her massive love and sort of texting throughout the day and checking up she’s ok. So, she’s fine, just annoyed, so lots of love, get well soon,’ Phillip said. ‘Get well soon Hols,’ Josie added, before they got on with the rest of the show. We just hope that she’ll be well for the upcoming Dancing on Ice Final, which will take place on Sunday, March 27. Her co-star and ‘work husband’ Phillip also tested positive for coronavirus at the end of January, which resulted in Stephen Mulhern stepping in as host on the competition series. In his time off, he spent hours binge-watching programmes including This Is Us and documentaries The Tinder Swindler and Don’t Mess With Cats, as well as undergoing a massive clean in his home.
