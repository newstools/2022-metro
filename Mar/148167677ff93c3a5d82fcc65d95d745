A man has been accused of murder after a teenager died at student accommodation in central London this weekend. Maher Maaroufe, 22, was arrested by police investigating the death of Sabita Thanwani, 19, in Sebastian Street, Clerkenwell. Police said Maaroufe was detained on suspicion of murder and assault, following a public appeal to locate him. Emergency services had been called to City University’s Arbour House at around 5.10am on Saturday, to reports that Ms Thanwani, a British national, was hurt. They attended along with medics to find that she had suffered serious neck injuries but, despite their efforts, she was pronounced dead at the scene. The force subsequently launched an appeal to trace the accused later that day. Detective Chief Inspector Linda Bradley, who has been leading the investigation, said: ‘I would like to thank everyone for publicising and sharing our appeal to trace Maaroufe. ‘Sabita’s family have been updated with this development and continue to be supported by specially trained officers. Our deepest condolences are with them. ‘I would ask everyone to respect their privacy at this indescribably devastating time for them as they come to terms with Sabita’s murder.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
