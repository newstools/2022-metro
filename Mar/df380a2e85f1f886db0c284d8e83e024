No one likes being interrupted in a moment of passion – but would you ram someone with your car if they stopped you from getting lucky? One masked-up couple having sex in a ‘bouncing’ white Sedan allegedly didn’t take kindly to a security guard asking them to stop their tryst. The male driver is accused of yelling ‘what’s your problem’ – before starting the engine and aiming the vehicle at Warat Luntong, 20. CCTV footage shows the guard jumping out of the way in the parking lot of a market in Bangkok, Thailand. Police tracked down the registered owner of the car – but she says she ‘lent it to a friend that night’. The ‘friend let someone else borrow it before the car vanished’, she claims. Warat has revealed it’s far from the first time he’s discovered a couple having too much fun in the car park – despite only being in the job for eight months. ‘Sometimes I would even see people getting on top of each other and sometimes I had to wait for a car to stop rocking before I walked over to them’, he said. Describing the most recent romp he stumbled upon, he said: ‘He yelled at me asking what my problem was. I did not see their faces clearly but if I do find them again, I will remember who it was.’ The car owner told police: ‘I still don’t know where the driver went. I am here at the station today to take responsibility for what had happened since it is my car. I will pay for any damages the security guard suffered.’ A hunt has been launched to find the driver, estimated to be in his 20s with a bald head. His female partner has only been described as ‘skinny’, while both were wearing masks during the romp. A police spokesman for the Saimai district station said officers were unable to trace the car on CCTV after it left the scene. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
