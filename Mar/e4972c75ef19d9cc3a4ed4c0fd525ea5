Newcastle United director Amanda Staveley believes it is ‘sad’ and unfair that Roman Abramovich has been forced to sell Chelsea. Abramovich announced on Wednesday evening that he has put Chelsea up for sale, claiming that the decision is ‘in the club’s best interest’. The Russian billionaire’s move comes following pressure directed at the UK Government to freeze the 55-year-old assets as part of its sanctions against Russia. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked Boris Johnson on Wednesday why he has not yet imposed sanctions on Abramovich, while Labour MP Chris Bryant put further pressure on the UK Government to act against Chelsea’s owner in the House of Commons on Thursday. But Staveley, who helped a Saudi Arabian-financed consortium complete the £305 million takeover of Newcastle United last year, believes it is unfair to call on Abramovich to sell the club because of his link with Russia president Vladimir Putin. ‘We’re always going to have geopolitical issues,’ Staveley said at the Financial Times Business of Football Summit ‘This world is never not going to have problems. It’s really hard, and I’m really sad today that someone is going to have a football club taken away because of a relationship he may have with someone. ‘I don’t think that is fair, actually, to be honest. But we do have to hold all of our relationships to account.’ Staveley also revealed that Newcastle United’s new owners had previously explored the possibility of buying Chelsea from Abramovich. ‘One great thing about taking four years to buy Newcastle was we had the great opportunity to look at every club, and that includes Chelsea,’ she revealed. ‘It is a wonderful club and I love working with all of my Chelsea colleagues on the Premier League board but there was only one club for us, and there will only ever be one club for us.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
