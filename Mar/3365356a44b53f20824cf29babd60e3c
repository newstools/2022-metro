Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta vouched for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s character after Barcelona boss Xavi sounded out the Spaniard before the Gabon international’s move to Spain. Aubameyang, 32, joined Barcelona on a free transfer in January after his contract was ended at the Emirates. Despite a sensational scoring record with the Gunners, Aubameyang left the club under acrimonious circumstances after a falling out with Arteta. Aubameyang was stripped of the captaincy after the latest in a long line of disciplinary breaches, with Arteta feeling he could no longer defend the striker as he demanded full commitment from the rest of the squad. It meant Aubameyang didn’t play for the club for the final two months of his time at Arsenal and even he was taken aback by the interest from Barcelona, having only received offers from the Middle-East. Aubameyang has hit the ground running at the Camp Nou, scoring eight goals in 11 matches. But his move was aided by a character reference from Arteta, who vouched for Aubameyang. According to the Daily Mail, Arteta was sounded out by Xavi through third parties about Aubameyang’s attitude and work ethic and the Arsenal boss put his personal problems with the striker aside to vouch for him. It’s claimed Arteta advised Barcelona to make a move for Aubameyang, as he still had plenty to offer at the top. Arteta is a former team-mate of Xavi’s, having been behind him in the pecking order at the start of his career at Barcelona. The striker scored twice in a sensational win against rivals Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Sunday. The 4-0 victory was Xavi’s most significant yet as Barcelona boss.
