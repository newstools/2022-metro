A woman has been arrested for allegedly slashing another woman in the face for eating on a New York City subway train. Shailyn Souffrant, 22, was detained by police on Tuesday and charged with assault in the violent incident aboard a train in Brooklyn earlier this month, according to the New York Police Department. Souffrant, of Bath Beach, awaits her arraignment in Brooklyn criminal court, the New York Daily News reported. The attack occurred around 10.30pm on March 16 aboard a D train. The train was approaching the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station when Souffrant allegedly went up to a 33-year-old woman and told her stop eating, cops said. When the victim continued eating, the suspect took out a knife and allegedly cut up both sides of the woman’s face. The victim was transported in stable condition to NUY Langone Hospital Brooklyn. Police had offered a $3,500 reward on March 22 for information leading to the suspect’s arrest. They released images of the suspect with dark hair pulled back in a bun and wearing a dark jacket, gray zip-up hoodie and blue jeans, going through a subway station turnstile. It is one of the latest arrests in a slew of crimes in the subway system. New York City Mayor Eric Adams unveiled a Subway Safety on February 21 sending 1,000 police officers out in an attempt to curb violence across the transit system.
