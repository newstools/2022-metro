Erik ten Hag has dismissed reports that he’s learning English in anticipation for a move to Manchester United this summer. The Dutchman is a leading candidate for the managerial role at Old Trafford, which United hope to fill before the season finishes. Recent reports claimed the Ajax boss was taking English lessons in his spare time, such was his determination to hit the ground running if he manages to convince the United board to pick him over Mauricio Pochettino. But, speaking before Ajax’s elimination in the Champions League last night, ten Hag said the reports are not true and he already speaks English with many members of his squad. ‘No, that (report) is not true!’ said ten Hag.‘We (already) talk English at the club because there are a lot of foreign players in Holland and they are already educated in English so (it makes sense).’ United’s elimination from the Champions League means the club are likely to bring forward an announcement on their next manager. Ajax are currently two points ahead of PSV in the Dutch league and the club would therefore prefer not to have any outside influences to destablise their title hunt. Ten Hag was asked about leaving the club before last night’s defeat to Benfica but he said ‘today’ was not the time to discuss his future. ‘I do not think that is an issue today, this evening is all about our match,’ he said. ‘I am focused on that and I do not pay any attention to other subjects. My only focus is Ajax vs Benfica.’ MORE : Jamie Carragher names Erik ten Hag as the best candidate for the Manchester United job For more stories like this, check our sport page.
