John Fury angrily confronted Carl Frampton for backing Jake Paul to beat his son Tommy Fury. Tommy’s fight with Jake Paul was scheduled for December but the former Love Island contestant was forced to pull out due to a bacterial chest infection and a broken rib. Giving his prediction ahead of the bout, Frampton said: ‘I think that it’s a huge fight and if I’m being honest, I’d probably favour Jake Paul in the fight. ‘He carefully picked his opponents obviously and he’s not fought a boxer yet, but the first boxer he’s fighting is a guy who’s a relative novice in the grand scheme of things and who seems to have issues going more than four rounds. ‘So I think that I would favour Jake Paul in that fight and then we hear him, as mad as it may sound, he’s beat a real boxer, although it’s Tommy Fury, he starts calling out Gervonta Davis, Canelo [Alvarez] it’s mental. But, yeah I’d favour him in the fight against Tommy Fury.’ And at Tuesday’s press conference to promote Tyson Fury’s fight with Dillian Whyte, which is scheduled for April, John Fury caught up with Frampton. In the brief exchange, Fury asked the former two-weight world champion: ‘You think Jake Paul’s a boxer?’ Frampton replied: ‘He’s not a boxer.’ Fury then said: ‘Well why do you think he can beat Tommy then? Answer the question now. Because you disappoint me and I looked up to you and I supported you.’ Frampton replied: ‘I’m trying to be honest, John.’ Fury then fired back: ‘Honest? Saying a YouTuber can beat a Fury, are you pissed? I don’t want to talk to you, I’ll turn my back on you, I don’t want to talk to you at all, get your facts right or get off the job.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
