Paris Saint-Germain supporters relentlessly booed Lionel Messi and Neymar in the club’s first match after the side’s Champions League exit to Real Madrid. The Ligue 1 giants were knocked out of the Champions League at the last-16 stage after capitulating at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. A 1-0 win in the first leg in Paris gave Mauricio Pochettino’s side a good advantage heading to Spain and a Kylian Mbappe goal doubled the side’s aggregate lead in the first half at the Bernabeu. But a Karim Benzema hat-trick sealed an incredible comeback for Madrid and left Pochettino clinging onto his job. Mbappe was the only performer in PSG’s formidable front three, with Messi and Neymar disappointing over both legs. Neymar was signed for a world record £199.5m in 2017 with the single goal of winning the Champions League and Messi’s arrival last summer was supposed to be the final piece of the jigsaw. But supporters, who booed the pair during the warm-up, continued to do so when they received the ball in the first half against Bordeaux. At one point, Messi and Neymar were stood over a free-kick and they were roundly whistled and jeered. When Neymar’s effort went flying over the crossbar, the jeers turned to ironic cheers.
