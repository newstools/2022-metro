Ukrainian forces have retaken control of the eastern city of Chuhuiv with two high-ranking Russian commanders killed in the battle. But Ukrainian nuclear power plant workers are surviving on ‘one meal a day and two hours’ sleep’ after being taken hostage by Kremlin troops, reports claim. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has named Vladimir Putin’s third ceasefire proposal ‘immoral’ as most refugees involved would have to go to Russia. Families were told they could safely flee Mariupol and Volnovakha on Saturday, and again on Sunday – but tragedy struck when Russian forces were accused of continuing shelling. A Russian air strike in Makariv, close to Kyiv, hit a bread factory in the town and killed at least 13 civilians. Meanwhile calls to boycott Coca Cola, PepsiCo and McDonald’s are growing as they continue to do business in Russia, after dozens of big brands hated operations in the country in response to the invasion of Ukraine.
