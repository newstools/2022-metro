Peter Andre finally got to hug his parents in Australia after two years apart. The singer, 49, shared some emotional snaps of their reunion, saying he’s had ‘the greatest’ few days with his mum especially, after sharing recently that her health is ‘really declining’. The Mysterious Girl hitmaker – who lives in the UK with wife Emily and their children – flew to Australia after Covid travel restrictions lifted. He was joined by son Junior, 16, who he shares with ex wife Katie Price. Taking to Instagram to document his reunion with his parents, Pete posted an adorable selfie showing him kissing his mother’s cheek while she smiled. He captioned the post: ‘These last few days with my mum have been the greatest days in many many years. I can’t begin to express how I feel to be with her. I’m happy now ❤️❤️❤️🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺.’ The star was flooded with messages of love from fans and celebrities, with fellow Aussie Dannii Minogue saying ‘welcome back home’ and Vanessa Feltz saying she had the ‘privilege’ of meeting his ‘delightful’ mum. Peter also shared a photo of mini-me Junior cuddling his grandmother as she pecked his cheek, with the caption: ‘Yiayia and J 🇦🇺 🇨🇾.’ Junior – who is following in his dad’s footsteps to pursue music – commented on the post: ‘Love my yiayia ❤️🥺’ The Australian musician shared some photos with his dad on his story, calling him his ‘absolute hero’. One adorable pic showed father and son dining out for their evening meal, cosying up with big smiles on their faces. Peter said he ‘will cherish these moments forever’ after being apart from his family for such a long time. The former I’m A Celebrity campmate recently wrote in his New magazine column that he fears for his parents as he ages himself. ‘I feel great about being a year away from 50. I dreaded turning 40 but actually my forties have been really amazing, I feel relaxed, and in a very happy place career wise and personally. ‘The only thing that worries me about turning another year older is that my parents are getting older and my mum’s health is really declining, which makes me sad,’ he shared. He didn’t go into any further detail about his mum’s health, but frequently shares his love for his parents on social media. In September last year, Savvas and Thea celebrated their 66th wedding anniversary, with Pete paying tribute with a throwback snap and sad caption about not being able to celebrate with them. He said his love for them is ‘beyond words’ as he ‘prayed’ for borders to open soon. ‘Thank you for inspiring me in every possible way. Bringing me and my brothers and sister up in a way that I hope has made you proud. I hope we’ve listened ( im sure I’ve messed up a few times, and for that I apologise); but I have and will always try to think of you both and your lessons as I bring my children up in this changing world,’ he wrote lovingly. ‘Thanks for being so amazing to us all and hope you both have a lovely day. Like you always say dad, ‘it’s only the first 100 years that are tough’ 😂. Love and all the respect in the world. Love from your son.’ When he finally got the green light and was able to fly down under, Pete couldn’t help but share his excitement. Reposting an article on his Instagram to share the news, he wrote: ‘Easily the greatest news I could ask for. My year is made. Thank you thank you.’ He added: ‘I am so happy.’ Got a story?
