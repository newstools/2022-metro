On day seven of Kate Middleton and Prince William’s tour of the Caribbean, the Duchess of Cambridge went for all out princess glamour. To attend a reception in Nassau, Bahamas, hosted by the Governor General at Baha Mar Resort, Kate opted for an ice blue silky satin dress that gives serious Cinderella vibes – or Grace Kelly influences, depending on your preferred references. That gown is the creation of Phillipa Lepley, a London-based couture wedding dress designer. We don’t know the exact price of the dress, but typically pieces from this designer start at around £6,000, and are only sold in her Fulham boutique. Fancy. The gown is called the Vienna Crossover, and is crafted from a single piece of satin, moulded over a bodice in a flattering wrap style, and has a full skirt – plus sweet bow detailing on the shoulders. Accessories-wise, the Duchess opted for a perfectly matched Lulu Guinness box clutch bag, Gianvito Rossi heels, and mother of pearl jewellery by Van Cleef & Arpels (which you can indeed buy… for £8,050 for the necklace, and £5,050 for the earrings).
