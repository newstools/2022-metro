This is the moment a Ukrainian couple bravely stand up to four Russian troops who stormed into their garden. It is thought the soldiers were attempting to loot houses in the village of  Voznesensk, in Ukraine’s Mykolayiv Oblast region. Despite having no weapons on them, the middle-aged couple were prepared to stand their ground after the troops broke open a gate and entered their property. A balding man can be seen shaking his fist at the soldiers while his wife shouts at them. One of the soldiers even shoots his gun in the air in an attempt to scare them away, but it has no effect. A fourth soldier comes through the gates and joins the other three to investigate the racket. But the couple keep on shouting at them as a dog darts back and forth through the gate. Realising that the plucky couple weren’t about to back down, the Russian soldiers point their guns toward the ground and shuffle towards the exit as the dog barks at them.
