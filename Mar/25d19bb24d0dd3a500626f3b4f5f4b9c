Brandon Williams and Christian Eriksen shared a heart-warming moment on the pitch as the Norwich City defender went to angrily confront the Brentford midfielder before quickly realising who it was. Eriksen, who made his return to football last week eight months after suffering a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, hauled down Williams during Norwich’s Premier League match against Brentford on Saturday. Williams looked furious as he hit the turf and went to grab Eriksen by the shirt. But as the on-loan Manchester United full-back went to do so, he quickly realised it was Eriksen who had brought him down and opted to hug the Danish midfielder instead. Eriksen, who has signed a contract with Brentford until the end of the season, is the the first known Premier League player with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) fitted following his cardiac arrest last year. Brentford, meanwhile, went on to secure a 3-1 victory over Norwich to boost their hopes of avoiding relegation from the Premier League. Speaking about Eriksen’s performance after the game, Brentford manager Thomas Frank told talkSPORT: ‘I would say incredible, I would say the 90 minutes [was] fantastic. ‘As I said earlier and in some of the press conferences, it would take him some time to get up to that top level. ‘But you still saw three, four, five top actions, I think the delivery for the first goal, I think there were some balls in behind for his teammates where you could just see ‘wow, that’s another level’. ‘But also in situations where he could have done a bit better, done better on the ball, which is good. ‘We just want him on the top level. ‘But for him a big moment last week, a big moment today and 90 minutes, so very good.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
