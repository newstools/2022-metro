Yes, you read that right – soon you’ll be able to get your hands on something called gravy mayo. Launching in April, Hellmann’s is offering the nation the chance to get in on a… unique new flavour. Inspired by the rise of ‘fakeaway’ cooking while eateries were close during the lockdowns, the gravy mayonnaise is pretty much exactly what it sounds like. It will combine the rich taste of gravy with creamy mayo, apparently in a bid to unite the chippy tea preferences (gravy up north, mayonnaise down south) of the nation. And that’s not all. The condiment company is also launching a chilli and a coronation chicken inspired mayo along with the gravy rendition. The coronation mayo is intended to pay homage to the Queen’s upcoming Jubilee, and the chilli offering is set to be ‘perfect for dipping your chicken or squeezing onto burgers’. Rachel Chambers, marketing manager at Hellmann’s, said: ‘We know just how much Brits love a takeaway and with the fakeaway style of cooking booming during lockdown, we wanted to provide the nation with restaurant-inspired flavours they could enjoy at home. ‘We’re incredibly excited to announce our market-first gravy mayo and hope all three, delicious new flavours will bring a bold new twist to dishes served at Jubilee parties and BBQs nationwide this summer.’ All three of these newbies will be hitting shelves next month for an RRP of £2.25 per 250ml bottle.
