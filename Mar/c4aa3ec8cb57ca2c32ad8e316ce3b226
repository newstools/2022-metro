Mikel Arteta has backed Arsenal’s decision to loan out William Saliba after the defender made his senior debut for France over the international break. The 21-year-old hasn’t played a single competitive minute for the Gunners since his £27million move from Saint-Etienne in 2019. Saliba has been on three separate loan spells during his time as an Arsenal player, with the latest a stint at Marseille. The centre-back has performed well in Ligue 1, with his impressive form earning him a first call-up for France. Saliba came on as a substitute in a 2-1 win over Ivory Coast and then started in the 5-0 victory against South Africa for Didier Deschamps’ side. In a press conference on Thursday, Arteta stated Saliba wouldn’t have been guaranteed regular minutes at the Emirates, but is pleased to see his improvements. ‘We are really aware of what he’s doing, how he’s developing,’ said the Gunners boss. ‘He’s our player and we are really happy with the decision that we made because the exposure, minutes, responsibility and growth at his age is something we could not guarantee him this season. ‘It makes a lot of sense what is happening with him and we are glad to see him the way he is improving.’ MORE : Arsenal striker Alexandre Lacazette scores hat-trick in Brentford friendly MORE : ‘They’re not going to compete’ – Gary Neville explains why Mikel Arteta could leave Arsenal this summer For more stories like this, check our sport page.
