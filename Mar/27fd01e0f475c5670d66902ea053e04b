Manchester United interim boss Ralf Rangnick is set to keep faith in Cristiano Ronaldo for Sunday’s Manchester Derby at the Etihad, despite grave concerns over the veteran’s form and suitability to his tactics. The 37-year-old is on his worst scoring run in over 14 years, having netted just once in United’s last 11 matches. Rangnick’s primary concern is about Ronaldo’s fitness, with the German feeling the Portugal captain is unable to carry out his high-press tactics. Ronaldo missed a host of chances in United’s 0-0 draw against Watford on Saturday, which was his fifth start in 15 days for the Red Devils. But Rangnick would stomach Ronaldo’s unsuitability for his system if the forward was still finding the back of the net but he’s woefully out of form. The former Schalke boss believes United need to replace Ronaldo this summer with a younger striker and he’ll advise the next manager – whoever that may be – that that is the case. But, in the absence of experienced options, the Sun say Rangnick has decided to stick with Ronaldo for Sunday’s trip to Manchester City. Edinson Cavani has missed the last six weeks with a groin and stomach injury, while Marcus Rashford is badly out of form and better from the left flank. United expect to have Scott McTominay back after the Scot missed the draw against the Hornets through illness. City beat United 2-0 in the reverse fixture earlier this season but in truth they could have won by a greater margin, in what was one of the final matches of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign.
