Barcelona are preparing a summer move for Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves, hoping to beat Manchester United and Arsenal to his signature. The 24-year-old has been linked with a switch to Old Trafford and the Emirates in recent months, with Wolves reportedly placing a £40m price tag on him in January. Neither the Red Devils nor the Gunners made their move, but Barcelona have begun talks with intermediaries over a summer bid for the Portuguese star, according to the Daily Mail. Neves will still have two more years on his current contract at Molineux but is thought to be open to a move and could follow his former teammate Adama Traore from Wolverhampton to Barcelona. Jorge Mendes is Neves’ agent and the man who brokered that loan move for Traore, which is expected to be made permanent in the summer. Francisco Trincao went the other way last summer, joining Wolves on loan from Barca, so the clubs are very used to doing business with each other. Wolves made the superb signing of the midfielder in 2017, bringing him in from Porto for nearly £16m when they were in the Championship. He has since played over 200 games for the club in all competitions and helped them become a fixture in the Premier League over the last four seasons. Bruno Large is enjoying an impressive first campaign as Wolves boss, with the team eighth in the Premier League, but Neves would undoubtedly be tempted by a move to the Camp Nou, or a switch to Old Trafford or the Emirates is Barca’s interest forces Manchester United or Arsenal into action.
