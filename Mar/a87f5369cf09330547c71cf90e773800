Picture the scene: the police are called to scary reports a tiger is roaming the streets of Oldham. A concerned resident said they spotted a ‘tiger’ in the garden in Greater Manchester and made the call on Monday evening. Officers rushed to the scene to find very terrifyingly – it’s just a stuffed animal. After their laughter subsided, they decided to take in the toy and call him ‘Tony the Tiger’, after the cartoon advert for Kellogg’s Frosties. The Greater Manchester Police Oldham Central division posted on Facebook with the title: ‘Concern for welfare.’ The post read: ‘Yesterday evening Oldham Police earned their stripes when they were contacted by a concerned member of the public of a tiger lose in nearby gardens that appeared to be pawing in the grass. ‘Officers arrived quickly and after evaluating the situation agreed it was in fact not a real animal but a toy – Tony The Tiger! ‘Tony the Tiger was asked for a comment about Oldham Police, he said: “They’re grrrrrrrreat!” ‘Tony is now safely booked into property at Oldham Police station.’ Several people enjoyed the joke, with one person writing: ‘I bet everyone thought GMP couldn’t deal with this, but you showed them that you Shere Khan.’ Another joked: ‘Was it a cereal offender?’ Someone else added: ‘GMP, they’re g g g great.’ This is not the only unusual incident police have had to deal with in recent weeks. A man led police on a hair-raising high-speed car chase from London to Kent, and when he was finally caught could only produce a driving licence from Legoland.
