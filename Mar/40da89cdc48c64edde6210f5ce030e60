Arsene Wenger is not ruling out a return to football management, saying he still feels ‘vulnerable’ to an approach if one comes. The 72-year-old has not managed since leaving Arsenal in 2018, having spent 22 years with the Gunners. He is not working as FIFA’s Chief of Global Football Development and it would take a seriously good offer for him to return to a dugout, but the Frenchman admits it is possible to tempt him back into management. He misses the cut and thrust of day-to-day management and still craves it, even though he turns 73 later this year. ‘You know, I can contribute in a different way,’ Wenger told beIN Sports. ‘I still miss it. I still miss the intensity. So, overall, I’m still vulnerable. ‘I’m like a guy who no longer takes drugs. I also think that I can contribute in a different way.’ The three-time Premier League champion with Arsenal spoke passionately about his love of football and how it has not diminished since leaving direct involvement in the club game. ‘It’s caring about the beautiful game, the values that we cherish, and also this thing we have in our bodies, in each cell of our bodies,’ he said. ‘We care, we worry, we are desperate, but when you come here, this theatre of dreams, we realise what it means.’ Wenger’s name has been brought up in relation to a role at Paris Saint-Germain, although that would more likely be in a role upstairs, rather than the dugout. Mauricio Pochettino is not expected to still be in charge of PSG next season, with Zinedine Zidane the favourite to replace him and Wenger could also replace Leonardo as sporting director, according to reports in France.
