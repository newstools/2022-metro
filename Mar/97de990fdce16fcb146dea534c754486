A gunman ordered food and sat down in McDonald’s before ‘opening fire on the table next to him’. Two brothers, aged 57 and 62, were killed in the ‘targeted’ attack in Zwolle, the Netherlands, according to reports. Police are hunting the assailant who fled following the shooting in the crowded restaurant where children were eating. Witnesses said he had been hanging about outside McDonald’s for hours before the killings. The stream of bullets spurred ‘chaos and panic’ with dozens running for safety, De Telegraph reports. The victims are said to be two influential businessmen of Turkish-Kurdish descent, who ran restaurants in the city. One had already died when paramedics arrived, while the other was resuscitated but passed away after. A relative reportedly sobbed as she said: ‘It’s a tragedy. They were just sitting here eating.’ Peter Snijders, the mayor of Zwolle, has described the incident as ‘extreme violence in an environment where you would not expect it’. He added that McDonald’s employees were understandably ‘very shocked’. Support will be provided for them, he promised. The restaurant has been cordoned off as police launch an investigation. Anyone with information has been urged to come forward to Overijssel Police. In a tweet, officers said: ‘Many McDonald’s guests fled the restaurant at the time of the shooting. ‘The police would like to speak to anyone who was present in the building or on or around the McDonald’s property shortly before or at the time of the shooting.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
