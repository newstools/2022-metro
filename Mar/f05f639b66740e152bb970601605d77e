Thomas Tuchel says Reece James should not join up with the England squad next week and insisted he remain at Chelsea as he returns from injury. James was sidelined for two months with a hamstring injury at the end of 2021 but returned against Burnley at the start of the month – scoring in that 4-0 win over the Clarets. The full-back suffered another knock in that game however and has been unavailable for subsequent games against Norwich City, Newcastle United, Lille and Saturday’s FA Cup clash against Middlesbrough. James has been back in training but after being named in the England squad on Thursday, Tuchel is keen for his player to remain at his club. Speaking after the 2-0 win over Middlesbrough, Tuchel told reporters: ‘The recommendation is that he does not go. ‘He is still in individual training, otherwise we would have brought him to Lille and we would have brought him here for sure. ‘There is no doubt about it. He is still in individual training, he needs one more week of rehabilitation and I think we can provide this much better. ‘It is not the job of the national team to do this.’ Tuchel is hoping players who haven’t been called away on international duty can use the break to recharge ahead of the season run-in – while also praying for no fresh injury problems. ‘The players will recharge and disconnect from football because they deserve and I think it’s very important they have this chance to have a fresh mindset for the rest of the season,’ Tuchel said. ‘For the guys on international duty, I hope they have the success they want and come back not injured.’ MORE : ‘It hasn’t worked out for him’ – Alan Shearer not convinced Thomas Tuchel wanted Romelu Lukaku at Chelsea MORE : Doubts emerge over Saudi Arabia bid for Chelsea after Friday’s deadline passes For more stories like this, check our sport page.
