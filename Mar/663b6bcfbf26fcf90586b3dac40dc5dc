The bone of a 68-million-year-old ‘majestic’ dinosaur reveals that it had a broken wrist after falling awkwardly. The break may have occurred while jumping over rough terrain or following a mating session. ‘It was standing on its heels for maybe eating, mating, perhaps just [passing] time, when it fell,’ said palaeontologist Filippo Bertozzo from the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. While the Russian dinosaur – known as a hadrosaur Amurosaurus riabinini – appeared to have survived the accident, the resulting limp may have made it difficult to escape from predators. The team of experts, led by Dr Bertozzo, analysed a single bone found in a quarry of the city of Blagoveshchensk in far eastern Russia. While investigating the cause of some swelling, they say they uncovered some impressive results. Dr Bertozzo added: ‘Against all the odds the dinosaur survived the accident as we can see that the bone was actually beginning to heal – this suggests that it didn’t die immediately. ‘However, it is likely that the injury led the animal to limp on three limbs, affecting its chances of escaping from predators.’ Professor Eileen Murphy, from the School of Natural and Built Environment at Queen’s University Belfast, supervised the research. She said: ‘The study of ancient diseases and injuries, whether in past animals or humans, can provide a huge amount of information about the lives of past individuals. ‘This study has enabled us to learn more about the experience of an injured animal in the period leading up to its death; it serves to remind us that even majestic dinosaurs could have accidents.’ MORE : Last day of the dinosaurs ‘arrived in the spring’ MORE : ‘Unique specimen’ of flying, Jurassic-era dinosaur fossil found in Scotland
