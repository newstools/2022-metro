Nigeria fans showed their fury as the country failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 16 years, invading the pitch and causing damage to the Moshood Abiola National Stadium. There were ugly scenes in Abuja as goals and benches were damaged and fans ran onto the pitch and around the stadium. Tear gas was deployed to try and put a stop to the chaos, with the Sun reporting that there was some violence in the stands between opposing fans. The reaction came after Nigeria were narrowly beaten in their World Cup qualifying play-off by Ghana. The first leg of the tie had ended goalless and the second finished in a 1-1 draw, which sent the Ghanaians to Qatar and the Nigerians in a furious mood in their own national stadium. William Troost-Ekong had given the home side the lead, before Arsenal’s Thomas Partey scored the equaliser and sent his side to the World Cup. While the scenes were clearly completely unacceptable, it came from the surprise that the Super Eagles missed out on the World Cup for only the second time since 1994. Nigeria missed out in 2006, but have otherwise been at every World Cup since they made the round of 16 in USA 1994.
