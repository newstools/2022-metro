Three supersonic fighter jets that will ‘leave Vladimir Putin in a sweat’ were spotted arriving in the UK. The F-35B lightning jets, worth £100million a piece, landed one after the other at  RAF Marham in Norfolk, marking the first batch of stealth jets to arrive this year, The Sun reports. They are capable of conducting air-to-surface, electronic warfare, intelligence gathering and air-to-air missions simultaneously. The aircrafts carry 22,000lbs of firepower including eight Paveway laser-guided bombs and infrared homing missiles designed to outrun any other airborne bomb.

They are the first of their kind to evade radar stealth technology due to their supersonic speeds, and can also carry the GAU-22A 25mm cannon in a pod above their port engines. ‘These fighting machines will leave Putin or any enemy in a sweat. They are awesome and fearsome jets,’ a witness said. The jets arrived from Texas and are believed to be destined for the RAF, who reportedly want to own 80 of them. They first arrived in 2013 while three will arrive later this year and seven more in 2023. It’s expected all 48 in the first batch will be delivered by the end of 2025.
