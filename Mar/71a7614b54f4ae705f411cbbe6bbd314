Paul Merson believes Aaron Ramsdale made a ‘lazy’ error that allowed Liverpool to take control of their crucial Premier League clash against Arsenal. The Gunners were in control for much of the first-half at the Emirates but conceded twice in the space of eight minutes in the second period. The win sees Liverpool move to within a point of league leaders Manchester City and leaves Arsenal just a point ahead of fourth place Manchester United – albeit with two games in hand. Diogo Jota opened the scoring with his near post effort squirming past Ramsdale who got a hand to his effort but was unable to keep it out. Merson was not impressed with Ramsdale’s positioning and believes the Gunners shot stopper failed to anticipate the shot. ‘It is poor defending all round and its poor goalkeeping,’ Merson told Sky Sports. ‘The goalkeeper gets lazy, he thinks it is going to be a cross. You should never ever get beaten at your near post.’ Graeme Souness agreed Ramsdale had got his positioning wrong, adding: ‘He gets a good hand on it but he is nearly at full stretch, that is how out of position he is. That is poor positioning.’ Jamie Carragher meanwhile believed Ramsdale was too late to react to Jota’s effort. ‘That looks for me like a problem. When the ball is struck he is still jumping into the air. ‘When he lands he is reacting late and hasn’t got the strength to hold it out with his hand.’ MORE : Andy Robertson hails Arsenal duo after Liverpool win at the Emirates to boost Premier League title hopes MORE : Jurgen Klopp explains why Mohamed Salah starts on the bench for Liverpool against Arsenal For more stories like this, check our sport page.
