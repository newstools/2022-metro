A blind Bulgarian mystic suggested a Russian named Vladimir would become ‘Lord of the World’ more than 30 years before Putin’s war in Ukraine. Baba Vanga, who died in 1996, was nicknamed the ‘Nostradamus of the Balkans’ for correctly predicting 9/11, Brexit and the rise of ISIS, according to her followers. Studies suggest her alleged prophecies had an 85% success rate, which made her popular across Europe and former Soviet Union nations. As Putin continues his invasion in Ukraine, Baba Vanga’s predictions about Russia’s future have come to light once again. ‘Too much is brought in a victim. Nobody can stop Russia,’ she told Russian writer Valentin Sidorov, the Daily Mail reports. ‘All will thaw, as if ice, only one remain untouched – Vladimir’s glory, glory of Russia. ‘All will be removed by her from the way and not only will be kept, but also becomes the lord of the world.’ Baba Vanga died at the age of 85 in 1996 after spending most of her life in a small mountain village in Bulgaria. At the time of her death, Putin was the leader of the Saint Petersburg branch of the liberal party in power. But given the ongoing fears of Russia starting World War Three, some people believe Baba Vanga may have predicted Putin’s global domination. After the Second World War, various eastern European and Soviet leaders sought Baba Vanga’s advice, believing her to be an oracle. Many of her followers believe she foresaw 9/11 among several other major events. In 1989, she said: ‘American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds… and innocent blood will be gushing.’ This is what some see as a prediction of the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001, when two planes hit the World Trade Center. Other visions are said to include the Chernobyl tragedy in 1986, Princess Diana’s death in 1997 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
