A millionaire who illegally built Britain’s ‘best man cave’ in his garden is facing jail after the latest deadline to tear it down expired. Graham Wildin installed a bowling alley, a cinema, squash courts, a casino and a bar in the massive extension eight years ago. After losing his appeal against a suspended prison sentence last year, the 69-year-old accountant was told by a court he had until March 10 to get rid of it. But with the deadline passed, none of the required demolition work appears to have been carried out. Wildin sparked outrage among his neighbours in Cinderford, Gloucestershire, when he built his now-infamous £200,000 hideaway in 2014 — without planning permission. He argued that he was taking advantage of a loophole allowing him to construct the 10,000 sq ft building for use by his family. But an enforcement notice by Forest of Dean council set in motion a lengthy legal fight, culminating in a High Court injunction in 2018. After failing to carry out the judge’s order to demolish the building by April 2020, Wildin was found in contempt of court and handed a six-week suspended jail sentence. After losing his appeal, he was warned he would be locked up if he failed to comply by yesterday. Last month, Wildin landed himself with a £300,000 bill after losing a tax and VAT appeal. He argued building costs for the extension were tax-deductible as it was a holiday let — but a tribunal ruled it was ‘for the private enjoyment of his immediate family circle’.
