Erik ten Hag has been warned his must get rid of three ‘trouble makers’ in Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba and Harry Maguire should he get the Manchester United job. The current Ajax boss was interviewed by United at the start of the week with the meeting understood to have been ‘positive’, with the 52-year-old detailing his philosophy and vision for the club. United still plan to interview other candidates on their shortlist, including long-term target Mauricio Pochettino and Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui with Spain boss Luis Enrique also under consideration. While ten Hag is considered a front runner, he has been warned back in Netherlands that he will face some considerable challenges should he land in Manchester this summer. ‘He just needs to get rid of those troublemakers. Ronaldo, Pogba, Maguire,’ was the advice of Rene van der Gijp, a former Netherlands international who is now a chat show host on Vendaag Inside, which attracts 1.4 million viewers per night. United are under pressure to make a quick decision, however. According to the Mail, two clubs who competed in the Champions League this season are also interested in ten Hag – with one of them already making him an offer. Pochettino meanwhile is thought to be a possible option for Real Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has guided the club to the top of La Liga and into the quarter-finals of the Champions League – knocking out Pochettino’s PSG in the process – this season but bosses at the Bernabeu are understood to be considering a change, not convinced by the Italian’s playing style.
