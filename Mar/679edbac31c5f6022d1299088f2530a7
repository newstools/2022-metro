The 27th annual Critics Choice Awards took place in The Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel in California last night and the stars were out in force. From TV to film screens, the heavyweights came to celebrate the best in showbiz. And as always, the fashion took centre stage as well. In comparison to the Bafta red carpet across the Atlantic ocean, colour played a more prominent role in the evening’s proceedings. From marine blues to deep greens, the red carpet lit up in several shades. However, muted tones stood their ground too. Hues of silver and gold were seen throughout with sparkles abound. In terms of silhouettes, they were structured and defined. Cape like dresses were seen on the likes of Mandy Moore and Selena Gomez, while ruffles and bows added hints of volume where needed. All in all, it was a fashion feast for the eyes. Here are some of the best looks from the night: Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
