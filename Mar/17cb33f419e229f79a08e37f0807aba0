Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab says Chelsea supporters were ‘totally wrong’ for chanting Roman Abramovich’s name during the minute’s applause for victims of the war in Ukraine. The gesture was held before kick-off in Chelsea’s fixture against Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday, with all Premier League clubs taking part. But while the majority of Chelsea and Burnley supporters joined the applause, some supporters in the away end began singing the name of Abramovich, who announced this week that he is selling the club. The chant by Chelsea fans was quickly met with boos from Burnley supporters before the referee blew his whistle to signal an end to the applause.

It’s not the moment to give other messages. It’s the moment to show respect. ‘We do this because this is what we are also as a club. We show respect as a club and we need our fans to commit to this minute of applause. ‘At this moment, we do it for Ukraine and there is no second opinion about the situation there. They have our thoughts and our support. ‘We should stand together as a club. It’s not the moment for other messages.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
