Prime Madeleine McCann suspect Christian Brueckner claims it is too dangerous to leave his cell because other inmates want to kill him. Brueckner, 44, is currently behind bars for raping a 72-year-old woman in Portugal in 2005. He was identified as the potential kidnapper last June, after German police said he often worked in holiday apartments near where Madeleine went missing in 2007. Brueckner claims the more his name has been associated with the infamous disappearance, the more he has suffered in jail. In a 14-page letter, reported on by German outlet Bild, Brueckner said he is being bullied and getting death threats from other prisoners. He wrote he is often left in isolation as he is too afraid to mix with other inmates. The rapist said he only leaves his cell for around an hour a day and avoids certain areas of the prison for his own safety. He also went on to moan about his pens being confiscated and a lack of coffee creamer. It comes after a source previously quoted by The Sun said Brueckner would likely never get charged in relation to the Madeleine case – because funding for the investigation is set to run out. Operation Grange was set up in May 2011 – four years after then-three-year-old Madeleine was taken from her holiday bedroom while her parents were out at dinner. Funding for the probe will reportedly finish on March 31. The Metropolitan Police has asked the Home Office to keep financing the operation until September which would take the total cost of the investigation to some £13 million. There were originally 40 people working for the Grange programme but now there are only four. Nevertheless, Madeleine’s parents Kate and Gerry have reportedly vowed to keep searching for their daughter. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
