A dad, from County Durham, built the ultimate gift for his Fireman Sam-obsessed son: a working fire engine. Chris Purdy, 39, wanted to build his seven-year-old son, Declan, a miniature fire engine after spotting the ride-ons on holiday. To kick off the project, he bought the shell of an old-ride for just £20 from Facebook Marketplace. Then, he added it a five-year old mobility scooter he found for £100 from the same site and spent another £200 on additional lights and accessories. Chris, who works as a HGV driver, began his project in November and has spent the last three months completing it. Now, the fire engine features sirens, blue flashing lights, a bull horn, an air horn, steering control and can even travel at 8mph. Chris explains that Declan has ‘adored’ Fireman Sam from a very young age. ‘I’ve had the idea for a while but when I saw the shell of an old ride come up for sale, I knew I had to give it a go,’ he says. Naturally, Declan loves his new vehicle – in fact, Chris says he asks to go on it every weekend. The DIY dad is also ‘half-toying’ with the idea of adding a water hose. ‘I’m not sure if it’ll work,’ he says. ‘It’s nice that we have something we can do together now.’ Seeing Declan laugh and smile means the world to Chris, who says that he’ll never sell it as ‘it brings him so much happiness and joy.’ This is the first mobility scooter project Chris has taken on, but he’s constantly looking for new DIY jobs to give a go. He adds: ‘If I get an idea, I can’t stop until I pursue it. I like making unusual, quirky thing.’ ‘My mind is in overdrive all the time.’ Do you have a story to share?
