Kevin Pietersen has hailed Sri Lanka legend Lasith Malinga and West Indies hero Sunil Narine as two of the best T20 bowlers of all time. A panel of current and former cricketers were asked to name their T20 greats across five categories in an interview with Betway. Former England star Pietersen chose Malinga as the greatest death bowler in history and Narine as the best T20 spinner, admitting he had ‘no idea’ how to play the West Indian. Elsewhere, South Africa batter Rassie van der Dussen and Indian cricket commentator Aakash Chopra labelled Virat Kohli the greatest run-machine in T20 cricket, while West Indies legend Chris Gayle was described as the best six-hitter in the history of the white-ball game.
