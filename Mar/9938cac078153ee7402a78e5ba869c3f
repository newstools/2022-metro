If you haven’t had Covid by now, you probably don’t have any friends, a top Korean doctor has claimed. ‘The adults who have not yet been infected with COVID-19 are those who have interpersonal problems’, Ma Sang-hyuk, vice president of the Korean Vaccine Society said on Facebook. His comments sparked criticism after they were rapidly shared throughout social media. He later deleted the post, claiming his words were meant to be ‘metaphorical’ and had been misunderstood, news site Daily reports. In an interview, he said: ‘It emphasised how difficult it is for anyone to avoid the virus in a situation where there is a high rate of confirmed cases in the area.’ Commenting on his initial post, a Facebook user named Belinda said: ‘I have no great interest in socialising. Even less now. ‘It doesn’t necessarily mean it is an interpersonal problem. It’s just a preference to do your own thing.’ Meanwhile, others claimed they had been in contact with the infected but had just been fortunate not to catch the virus. Ana Park said: ’I have been a direct contact to about a dozen people for the past three weeks and I feel lucky I haven’t gotten it’ Another person named Sharon directed her comments to Mr Sang-hyuk, saying: ‘Jealousy is ugly on you.’ The remarks came as South Korea was hit by a new wave of coronavirus. There were 400,741 new cases on 16 March, the day the health professional made the post. The Omicron variant, which hit the UK hard in December, has spurred the latest jump in infections. Despite the surge, the South Korean government is easing lockdown restrictions – with almost 87% of South Korea’s 52 million residents fully vaccinated.
