With today marking Mother’s Day, former Love Island star Katie Salmon shared with her followers online that she has given birth to a baby girl. After keeping the joyous news under wraps for six months, the 26-year-old announced that she and fiancé Harry were expecting their first child at the beginning of the year, with a montage of clips showcasing her pregnancy journey. Celebrating the annual holiday honouring mothers across the country, Katie and Harry have named their bundle of joy Thaiga Dean – ‘pronounced Tiger.’ In an Instagram post, Katie penned:  ‘Am officially a Mummy!!!! ‘Had some time off in my baby bubble but figured today would be the best day to let you all know. We welcomed our beautiful baby girl into this magical world.’ The reality star showed her gratitude to the NHS and her family and friends that have supported her along the way. She continued: ‘And my fiancé who is just my rock, you are my dream, thank you for giving me the world. We got you forever! ‘Going back into my bubble now I’ll be back soon but right now I’m just so content being with my little family and enjoying every second of this incredible blessing. Universe thank you for the greatest gift alive. My beautiful baby daughter.’ Fellow co-star and celebrities rushed to congratulate Katie, with former islander Alex Bowen writing: ‘Congratulations Katie, sending love to you all.’ While Geordie Shore’s Holly Hagan replied: ‘Awww congratulations angel.’ This wouldn’t be the first time Katie has shared exciting news on momentous occasions, as she announced her engagement to Harry on Christmas Day last year. In an Instagram post, Katie is pictured alongsideHarry, flashing her engagement ring and a big smile while he gives her a kiss on the cheek, following the romance proposal which took place on a Thai beach. She wrote in the caption: ‘HE ASKED ME TO BE HIS WIFE 😭❤️My best friend, my twin flame, The love of my life asked me to marry him and made me the happiest girl alive!!!!😢.’ The former reality star found fame on Love Island in 2016 where she made history as part of the show’s first same-sex couple with the late Sophie Gradon. Sophie, however, tragically took her own life in June 2018, with her devastated boyfriend, Aaron Armstrong, following just three weeks later. Got a story?
