Strictly Come Dancing judge Motsi Mabuse has expressed her disgust at clips of Black people being racially abused and stranded at the Ukraine border. Heartbreaking footage has circulated on social media showing African and Caribbean students being denied permission to cross over into Poland for safety, as Russia continues its deadly bombing attack amid its invasion of Ukraine. Many of the stranded students have been subjected to racism, with one man recalling how he was forced to disembark a bus after being told ‘no Blacks’. Motsi, who hails from South Africa and Germany, shared a clip of a room close to the border full of other Black students desperate to reach safety. The woman filming the video said: ‘We’re still stranded, we haven’t eaten, no rest, we were just in the cold for six hours outside.

Saving people according to their skin color!!!!! #AfricansinUkraine.’ She added: ‘Don’t forget the black brothers and sisters at the border !’ Reacting to the clip, one follower commented: ‘I’m so sorry. This is awful. I’ve seen awful footage of people being dragged off buses and barred from trains. I wish I could help. I don’t know. I just want you to know that I see this and I am sorry.’ Another said: ‘So upsetting 😢and makes me angry every time I see/hear about it 🤬 there are no words.’ One other added: ‘This is disgusting 😢 x hope they are all in a safer place soon.’ Loose Women presenter Charlene White also said her ‘heart goes out’ to the Black people affected by racism at the border, while American rapper Young Thug has offered to help those stranded. Several African nations have condemned the racial abuse, while the United Nations has since confirmed that some non-Europeans have faced discrimination while trying to flee to safety. Over the weekend, Motsi shared her upset at the prospect of not being able to visit her husband’s hometown in Ukraine. She tweeted: ‘2020 we booked our flights to spend Easter in Kharkiv and return a day before my birthday, because of lockdown we cancelled the trip . 2021 we were still on lockdown! 2022 seems I will never see the town my husband was born . He wanted to show me his motherland! #Kharkiv ‘Hopefully one day !! Another day filled with horror ! Please let this stop 🙏🏾🙏🏾’ She had previously expressed her fear for her husband Evgenij Voznyuk’s parents, saying they are not able to reach the Polish border following Russia’s invasion of the country. However, they were fortunately able to make contact with them and confirmed they were safe. Got a story?
