Cheeky thieves have pinched a crucial letter from the middle of a cricket club’s new sign – leaving it saying something very rude. The ‘s’ from the newly unveiled Old Bells End at Delph and Dobcross Cricket Club in Oldham disappeared on Sunday. Phil Whiteman, owner of the Old Bell Inn pub nearby which sponsors the cricket ground, saw the funny side of the theft but appealed for the letter to be returned. He said: ‘The pub is about 50 yards down the road from the club, so this year I thought it would appropriate to sponsor that end of the ground. ‘I knew we’d get some stick when we named it, but it was all light-hearted. Now though somebody has decided to steal the letter “s”. ‘It’s all a bit of a laugh, but I do want that “s” back. ‘These signs don’t come cheap nowadays. ‘I hope it’s a local that’s stolen it for a laugh and that they’ll return it soon, but I’ll give it a week or so and if it’s not turned up by then I’ll replace it.’ Unsurprisingly, locals took full advantage of the chance to crack jokes at the cricket club’s expense when the pub posted about the theft on Facebook. One commented: ‘You were asking for that to be fair.’ Another one added: ‘Oh what a shame. Who could have possibly done such a thing? ‘Hope they catch them.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
