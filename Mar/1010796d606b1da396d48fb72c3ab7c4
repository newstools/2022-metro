Ever wanted to live like a king? Well, now you can in one of Britain’s poshest villages. Tower House is a ‘castle-style’ regal home that has just gone on the market for £1.2million. The property is a historic mansion in Hinton St George, renowned to be one of the country’s poshest rural villages. Tower House is believed to have been built in 1814 and is being advertised by estate agent Savills. The regal four-bedroom building looks like a castle from the outside, with a clock tower and rampart-style brickwork. It now makes up a fascinating and historic wing of a fine country house. Tower House was formerly the Porte Cochere, or entrance building, to the nearby Hinton House. It formed part of a huge country estate that belonged to the Earl of Poulett and extended to several hundred hectares. Savills describes the property as ‘attractive and stylish accommodation with a wealth of period charm.’ To add to its beauty, the home also has a 0.6 acres walled garden and a hamstone archway. The interior of the home is dramatic and expansive with high ceilings, medieval stone carvings and stained glass windows. In addition, a concealed spiral staircase leads to the ‘Clock Room’ and roof terrace which has expansive views across Hinton House, the nearby park and the countryside. The guide price for the home has been set at £1.2 million and is currently subject to offer. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
