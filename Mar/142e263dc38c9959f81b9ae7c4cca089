Elizabeth Hurley has shared an emotional message for Shane Warne’s daughter Summer after the cricket legend died aged 52. The sportsman, who was in a relationship with Elizabeth from 2010 to 2013, died of a suspected heart attack on Friday while on holiday in Koh Samui, Thailand. Authorities confirmed an autopsy showed he died of natural causes. After sharing support for Shane’s son Jackson, 23, Elizabeth also commented on a heartbreaking tribute shared by Summer, 20. The actress, 56, wrote: ‘I love you, Summer. Your daddy worshipped you ❤️’ while Summer responded: ‘Love u so much ❤️’. Summer began her tribute by saying: ‘There is no words. It feels like i’m dreaming, waiting for someone to wake me up and tell me that you’re okay. This can’t be real life. There’s no way that life is this cruel to the most beautiful people on this earth [sic].’ She added: ‘I’d do anything to hear that laugh again, anything to hear your voice, anything to have one of your cuddles, anything to be with you again just one last time ❤️ I wish in your final moments before you went off to heaven and before you took your last breathe that I could tell you everything was going to be okay, and to hold your hand and tell you how much I love and look up to you. ‘I took our time for granted dad and I would do anything to have more time with you on this earth. Our time was robbed and I wish you would come back to me ❤️You may not be alive dad, but you will forever live inside my heart, I will cherish the memories till my time is up on this earth and I am reunited with you again ❤️ ‘I love you dad, forever and always will be my Father no matter where you are🕊 Love your little girl SJ and I will continue to make you proud.’ Jackson had also shared a heartbreaking tribute, pledging to make his father proud, with Elizabeth commenting: ‘I love you, Jackson ❤️’. In her own tribute to her former partner, Elizabeth posted on her Instagram account over the weekend. She wrote: ‘I feel like the sun has gone behind a cloud forever. RIP my beloved Lionheart @shanewarne23’. The couple enjoyed a high-profile romance following Warne’s divorce from ex-wife Simone Callahan. Warne was first photographed kissing the star in 2010, and the bowler subsequently confirmed on his Twitter account that he and Callahan had separated. Following the sudden death, Warne’s family have asked for privacy, with his mum revealing her ‘shock’ as they grieve the loss. The cricketing icon has been offered a state funeral, which his family have since accepted. Got a story?
