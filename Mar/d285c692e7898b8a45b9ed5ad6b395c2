A man has been charged with the murder of his parents after they were found stabbed to death at separate addresses 15 miles apart in Gloucestershire. Clive Warrington, 67, was found dead at an address in Sherborne Place, Cheltenham, after reports of a serious assault at around 6.25am on Wednesday. Later the same day, Valerie Warrington, 73, was found at an address in the village of Bourton-on-the-Water. The pair had been married but had subsequently divorced. William Warrington, 40, from Cheltenham, has been remanded in custody to appear at Cheltenham Magistrates’ Court on Saturday. On Thursday, Mr and Mrs Warrington’s family thanked well-wishers for the ‘outpouring of love and support’ they had received following their deaths. They said in a statement: ‘We are devastated by the sudden and tragic loss of our parents. ‘We thank everyone for their messages of love and support, which are of great comfort to us. ‘We would like to request privacy at this time so that we can come to terms with what has happened and grieve in peace with the rest of the family.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
