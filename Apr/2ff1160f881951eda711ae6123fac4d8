A distressed mum got trapped in a public loo and had to spend a pretty penny to get out. The toilet in question, located in the coastal resort town of Llandudno, North Wales, cost users 30p to use. Lucy Wishart, 47, duly paid the sum to enter but soon realised the electric door had become stuck behind her. The terrified dance instructor called her husband, Iain, who was luckily close by. But he was forced to pay another 30p to get his wife to safety. She said there was a sign inside advising visitors not to ‘panic’ if the door started playing up. ‘Imagine an elderly person getting locked in or a tourist travelling alone,’ she said. ‘Fortunately I had my phone to ring my husband who came to put another 30p in to let me out. This is really unacceptable. ‘The door is electronic and cannot be opened once inside. We reported it in the cafe and they said the council has been told many times.’ A green sign outside the toilet suggested she wasn’t the first person to get stuck. It reads: ‘If you have someone who appears to be locked in the toilet DO NOT PANIC. ‘Reassure the individual that everything is okay. ‘Advise them to press the unlock button (green or other button) to unlock the door. ‘Wait 15 minutes and then insert 30 pence and the door will release’. But Lucy said the advice was ‘useless’ unless anyone stuck had someone outside the loo to pay more money. She reported the problem to Conwy Council, who said: ‘We have closed the toilet temporarily while the manufacturer inspects and fixes the lock and we make other repairs.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
