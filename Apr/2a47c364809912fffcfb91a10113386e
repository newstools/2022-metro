A police officer had to have hospital treatment after a pick-up truck reversed ‘at speed’ into his patrol car in London. Video widely shared online shows how the yellow and black truck smashed into the car bonnet, causing extensive damage on Friday. The two officers in the car had asked the driver to stop because of the erratic way they were driving, as well as because there was damage to the vehicle. But instead, they rammed the police car and then drove off from the scene in Landor Road, Stockwell, at around 10.50am. One officer suffered injuries to his head and hand and needed hospital treatment. He has since been discharged. A second officer was assessed at the scene by paramedics. Police searched the area after the crash, but didn’t manage to locate the truck or identify those involved. Video shows how it rammed the police car so hard the vehicle is pushed backwards, as sirens wail and an onlooker shouts out ‘Woah!’ After this, the truck drove off at speed out of view of the camera. Police urged anyone who sees the truck to call 999. It is yellow and black in colour, with a damaged mirror on one side. The registration is believed to be FA04 UZW although the F is missing from the rear number plate. The truck has a waste disposal and removals company branding on the side, however the business reportedly posted on Facebook saying that they had sold the vehicle seven months ago. According to the Sun, the former owner posted that he had heard reports of the truck being involved with fly-tipping around south London and wanted to distance himself. A Metropolitan Police spokeperson said: ‘Anyone with other information about those currently in control of it, or its recent whereabouts, should call 101, giving the reference 2376/15APR.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
