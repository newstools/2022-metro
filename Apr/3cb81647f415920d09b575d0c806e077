A pair of conjoined babies that look like one baby with two heads shocked doctors after the parents were told to expect normal twins. The babies, born on March 28 in Ratlam in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, has three hands and two hearts. Shaheen Khan and husband Sohail were expecting twins for their first baby but were shocked when she gave birth to what they thought was a baby with two heads. The condition is known as dicephalic parapagus — where two infants are joined by one torso — and often results in a stillbirth. But the miracle infants have been admitted to a hospital in the nearby city of Indore to be monitored by doctors. Shaheen remains in the district hospital in Ratlam. One of the medics, Dr Lahoti, said: ‘These kinds of cases are rare and the condition of babies remains uncertain, especially in the initial days. ‘Due to this, we have kept them under observation. We have not planned for any surgery on the patient.’ In cases of dicephalic parapagus the babies’ prospects are best if no attempt is made to separate them, except in cases in which one twin is clearly dying. If two complete hearts are present, this improves their chances of survival. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
