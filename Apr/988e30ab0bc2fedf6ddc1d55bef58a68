Holly Willoughby struggled to keep her cool after a large spider invaded the This Morning set live on-air. Never a dull moment! As Phillip Schofield and Holly were getting ready to introduce the next segment during Thursday’s edition of the daytime show, a gruesome intruder entered the premises. The 40-year-old host was left cringing by the eight-legged insect and begged for   the cameramen to ‘stop filming it.’ During the commotion, Holly was quick to warn those at home with a ‘spider fear’ to look away. ‘It doesn’t look so big on the telly, but it’s really big.  Can someone put a glass over it,’ she said as the camera zoomed in on the giant insect. After a member of the production team moved closer, the spider scurried out of sight. The mum-of-three gestured a shooing motion and said: ‘Can we just make it go that way.’ ‘We are transmitting this!’ yelled Phillip. Luckily someone managed to put a glass cup over it – which meant Holly regained her composure. In case anyone was wondering, the spider was later set free outside. Those watching were quick to comment on the incident, with one writing: ‘Can we stop showing the spider on #ThisMorning please some of us can almost feel it on us at this point. ‘You really didn’t need to film that huge spider..You’ve set all the arachnophobics off now,’ another tweeted. This Morning airs weekdays at 10am on ITV. Got a story?
