A British dad and his young son have been killed after their family was caught in a landslide while on holiday in Australia. The father, 49, and his son, 9, died at the scene at Wentworth Pass in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. A woman, 50, and a teenager, 14, were rushed to hospital with significant head and abdominal injuries. They are in critical conditions following the tragedy, just before 1.40pm local time on Monday. A girl, 15, the fifth member of the family, has been treated for shock. Police said she was ‘extremely distressed’ following the ‘heart-breaking’ incident. Describing the accident, Acting Superintendent John Nelson said: ‘Unfortunately there’s been a landslip while they’ve been bushwalking. It’s quite a tragic scene.’ NSW Ambulance said seven road crews and two air crews were sent to the scene. Stewart Clarke, from NSW Ambulance, said the disaster happened in an ‘extremely dangerous, extremely unstable environment’. Part of the track was closed ‘due to flood damage and ongoing rockfall risk’, according to The National Parks and Wildlife Service website. The part of the track walked by the family was open. A Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) spokesperson said: ‘We are providing consular support to the family of a British couple and their children following an incident in Australia. We are in contact with the local authorities.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
