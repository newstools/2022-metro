Aaron Ramsdale angered Chelsea fans by winding them up after Bukayo Saka’s late penalty sealed Arsenal’s 4-2 win on Wednesday evening. Mikel Arteta’s side gave themselves a major boost to their hopes of securing a top-four finish in the Premier League with their victory at Stamford Bridge. Eddie Nketiah opened the scoring after 13 minutes but Timo Werner quickly scored Chelsea’s equaliser. A smart finish from Emile Smith Rowe put Arsenal back in front before Cesar Azpilicueta’s goal pulled Chelsea level before half time. Nketiah then scored his second of the game after capitalising on a poor piece of defending from Chelsea, while Bukayo Saka sealed Arsenal’s win late on by converting a penalty after he was fouled by Azpilicueta. Ramsdale, meanwhile, is well known for winding up opposition supporters during games and the Arsenal goalkeeper did the same thing to Chelsea fans after Saka scored Arsenal’s fourth. While Arsenal’s players were celebrating at the other end of the pitch, Ramsdale turned and began waving at Chelsea’s supporters, who quickly directed their fury towards the 23-year-old. Speaking earlier this season after he was caught winding up Leicester City supporters, Ramsdale claimed he used the anger from opposition fans as motivation. ‘I think it makes me play better, it makes me prove a point, it helps me prove someone wrong,’ Ramsdale told talkSPORT. ‘It raises my concentration levels. If I’m giving a bit to them and I make a mistake I know I’m going to get absolutely slaughtered. ‘I can’t let anything in if I’m giving them a bit of banter.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
