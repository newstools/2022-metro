A Benfica supporter threw a stick at Luis Diaz during Liverpool’s celebrations in the Champions League on Tuesday evening. Jurgen Klopp’s side will take a strong advantage back to Anfield ahead of next week’s return leg following their 3-1 win at the Estadio da Luz. Ibrahima Kounate and Sadio Mane gave Liverpool a two-goal lead by the break before Darwin Nunez pulled one back for Benfica early in the second half. Diaz wrapped up Liverpool’s victory with a late goal but as he celebrated in front of the Benfica fans, one supporter threw a stick at the former Porto winger. The object appeared to miss the Liverpool players who had run over to celebrate with Diaz, although Roberto Firmino held up his hand and looked in the direction of where the supporter was stood. The incident was not an isolated one as Liverpool’s players were pelted with objects from fans earlier in the game. ‘I had quite a few lighters thrown at me so maybe it’ll help them stop smoking! Take the positives,’ Andy Robertson told BT Sport after the match. ‘We’ve seen it a lot with people getting hit, things like that. Luckily, they were all quite close to me but none of them hit me. ‘They’re frustrated, I get that, but you should try and not throw stuff onto the pitch because it can hurt people. ‘I was just trying to take the corner and get out of there as quickly as possible.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
