Vladimir Putin’s nuclear bombers have been spotted in the skies over western Russia following the sinking of his warship in the Black Sea. Footage shows four Russian Tu-95s, known as Bears, flying in the Kaluga region, within striking distance of Ukraine. Moscow has previously used long-range bombers to strike Kyiv with non-nuclear cruise missiles. But it’s feared the Russian president may escalate his attacks after Ukrainian missiles reportedly destroyed his flagship Moskva. The Black Sea missile cruiser was a huge force in Putin’s naval front, battering the port cities of Odesa and Mariupol. His cronies claimed it sank on stormy seas after a fire caused by exploding ammunition – but Ukraine says it was brought down with two Neptune missiles. An image has also emerged claiming to show Moskva’s last moments.  Black smoke is seen pouring from the sinking vessel, with what appears to be lifeboats in the sea. A source told Russian media the ship sank shortly after these pictures were taken. If genuine, it was likely captured from a nearby Turkish ship, rumoured to have rescued 54 men. There is speculation hundreds may have died onboard amid a virtual news blackout from the Kremlin propaganda machine. Moskva first hit the headlines a few days into the invasion, when a Ukrainian soldier was filmed saying ‘go f*** yourself, Russian warship’ as its crew threatened to shell Snake Island.
