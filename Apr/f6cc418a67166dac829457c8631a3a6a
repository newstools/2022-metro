Four alleged members of a far-right sports group accused of wanting to set up a Nazi neighbourhood in a German town have been arrested. The men — identified only as Leon R, Maximilian A, Eric K and Bastian A — have been held in Germany as part of an investigation into extremist groups. They are said to be members of Knockout 51, based in Eisenach, with an aim to indoctrinate young men and train them in street fighting. The group, which has links to other far-right organisations, also tried to set up a ‘Nazi neighbourhood’, according to prosecutors. The group is believed to have held training sessions at the local headquarters of a small far-right party in the town in the east of the country. They are said to have clashed with police and counter-protesters at rallies against Covid restrictions and its members are accused of injuring several people. In all, 61 properties around Germany were raided yesterday. Prosecutors are investigating 21 people suspected of keeping alive the banned Combat 18 Deutschland group and ten thought to belong to Atomwaffen Division, a white supremacist organisation. Five people are also under investigation over the far-right chat group SKD 1418. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
