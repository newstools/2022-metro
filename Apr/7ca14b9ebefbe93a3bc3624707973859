A four-year-old boy has been taken to hospital after being seriously injured by an out-of-control dog. The child was mauled on Saturday night in Clydebank in West Dunbartonshire, police in Scotland have revealed. His injuries are not thought to be life threatening, but officers have launched an investigation into the attack, which took place in the Craiglea Road area of Duntocher. It comes after a two-year-old boy died in hospital two days after being mauled by a dog at a property in Egdon, Worcester, and suffering a cardiac arrest. Police have since removed three rottweilers from the building but could not confirm how many were involved in the attack. Late last month an eight-year-old boy was rushed to Birmingham Children’s Hospital after being bitten in the face by a dog in Cannock, Staffordshire, while a girl, aged six, hurt her arm. On March 21, an American bully XL – a legal breed – mauled one-year-old Bella-Rae Birch at her home in St Helens, Merseyside. In the decade up to 1991, 15 people were killed by dogs, according to the Office for National Statistics. But in the past 10 years that figure has risen to 32. Meanwhile the Canine and Feline Behaviour Association reports a 54% increase in dog attacks from 2020 to 2021. RSPCA dog specialist Dr Sam Gaines told the Sun that this could be related to ‘impulse buys’ over lockdown made by people who don’t necessarily have the time and resources to properly raise a dog. She suggested that the banned list of breeds could also be lulling people into a false sense of security, thinking that any other varieties of dog must be safe.
