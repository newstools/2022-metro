A new night-out spot is about to hit London this May, for gamers and party-goers alike. NQ64, a retro arcade destination, is opening up in Soho on Berwick Street – with classic games and a bar serving up themed cocktails. Making arcades more adult-friendly, the space features neon lights as well as spray-paint artwork that glows in the dark and is set to welcome DJs every week. Creators say the venue will give players a sense of ‘escapism’ as they’re surrounded by games galore and a vibrant-yet-dark backdrop. NQ64 co-founder, Matthew Robson, exclusively told Metro.co.uk: ‘We think NQ64 will bring a whole new dimension to the entertainment landscape of the capital by transporting visitors back in time, all while being the latest hotspot for those who just want to have a drink up and good night out in the town.’ Welcome to walk-ins and bookings, the bar has open spaces and a private room for parties – and is set to be London’s newest gaming spot. Visitors can choose from more than 30 original arcade games, with top picks including Guitar Hero, Dancing Stage and Pac-Man. There will even be classic consoles, which can be used for free if you’re having drinks, while other games will require tokens. The bar will also serve up gamer-themed cocktails, such as Kirby, Donkey Kolada and the Aku Aku Fruit Punch – inspired by Crash Bandicoot – and craft beers. Come the late hours, a DJ will play hip-hop music for those wanting more of a party atmosphere. A fun Saturday night? We think so. Do you have a story to share?
