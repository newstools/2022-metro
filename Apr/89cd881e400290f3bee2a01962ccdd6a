Fish and chips are a UK staple. No one does the meal as good as us and we are forever proud of the British delicacy. With its popularity, its no wonder every town and city is blessed with an excellent fish and chip haunt. And now, Britain’s best fish and chip takeaways and restaurants have been revealed. Named by the Fry Awards, there is no overall winner, just a lit of incredible fish and chip purveyors. The Fry Awards sent thousands of mystery diners out to fish and chip shops across the UK and they have found 60 outlets of exemplary standards. ‘We’re so pleased to announce this year’s winners,’ says Fry Awards competition organiser Reece Head. ‘The awards recognise and celebrate the hard work, passion and dedication that these operators put into running their businesses. ‘It’s been a tough couple of years for the industry, in particular for restaurants that have had to deal with closures, but operators continued to adapt, motivate their workforce and invest in new equipment and systems that have seen them come out the other side stronger and in a better position.’ On the list are 50 takeaways and 10 sit-down restaurants. The winning takeaways had to score 96% or over, and restaurants had to achieve 95% and above. Is your favourite on the list? Do you have a story to share?
