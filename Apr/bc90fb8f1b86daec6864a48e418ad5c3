The number of children put behind bars in England and Wales is expected to more than double within three years, a new report suggests. Catching up with the legal backlog from the pandemic, more police officers, and a new policing bill are expected to increase the amount of youngster in custody by September 2024. In February 2022, there were 414 children in custody but that is expected to rise by more than 50% in little over two and a half years, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). But despite the expectation in Government, the opening of a new secure school has been delayed by three years. The report also found that ethnic minority groups are overrepresented in custody and that many incarcerated children had mental health problems or learning difficulties. Self-harming rates inside have also rocketed. It said that the average number of children in custody fell by 73% between 2010-11 and 2020-21. But court recovery after Covid-19, alongside the impact of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill and Government plans to recruit extra officers. It is expected that the number of children aged 15 to 17 in young offender institutions will double, from 343 in July 2021 to roughly 700 in July 2025, the report added. That would return the number to roughly pre-pandemic levels, with 737 children were in custody in March 2019/20. But it would still be significantly lower than a decade ago – with 2,027 children in custody in March 2010/11. Over half of children in custody in the year ending March 2021 came from ethnic minority backgrounds, up from 32% in 2011, according to the report. It said black children accounted for 29% of those in custody, compared with 18% in the year ending March 2011. The report found that around one-third of children in custody reported having a known mental health disorder, while many had other health problems and learning difficulties. Self-harm incidents have increased by 90% among children in custody from March 2015 to March 2021, the report said. It noted that in February 2022, there were 414 children held in custody, either in secure children’s homes, young offender institutions (YOIs) or secure training centres (STCs) and said that there had been ‘mounting concerns’ over safety in STCs. Inspectors are said to have ‘persistently raised concerns’ over the welfare of children in England’s three STCs, rating them as either inadequate or requiring improvement in every year since 2017. The NAO added that STC ‘failures’ meant children were moved to areas of custody that had previously been viewed as unsuitable for their needs. In 2016, a Government-backed review of the youth justice system recommended the creation of secure schools, which would provide education and rehabilitation to children in a ‘therapeutic environment’. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it would create two new secure schools, but the opening of the first has now been postponed. It was originally due to open in autumn 2020, but has been delayed until November 2023. The NAO report also found that the average length of custodial sentences for children has increased from 11 months to 17 months between 2011 and 2021. Boys made up 97% of children in custody in 2021, but the report notes that while the proportion of girls held in custody is low, they have some of the most complex needs, and are likely to have experienced sexual and physical victimisation. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ‘We are committed to ensuring public safety and the best possible outcome for every child in our care. ‘Our new Secure School will put education, healthcare and rehabilitation at the heart of our efforts to cut crime and keep the public safe.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
