Tyson Fury and co decamped to Chigwell for a celebratory meal on Sunday afternoon, following his knockout victory over Dillian Whyte at Wembley, and were naturally joined by some of Essex’s finest, including Mark Wright and James Argent. The group celebrated at upmarket kebab restaurant Sheesh, sitting outdoors and making the most of the fine weather. Quite literally rolling out the red carpet for the WBC heavyweight champion, the 33-year-old was shown celebrating with a champagne toast as he arrived with wife Paris, 32, to whoops of ‘Congratulations to the King! Come on! King of the world!’ Tyson wore a dark suit with a multi-coloured paint drip design and wide-brimmed black hat for the occasion, while Paris looked cool in a khaki dress wrap dress and wedges. His entourage was later shown tucking into their food on the terrace, with the camera panning round to reveal a smiling Mark Wright sitting at the head of the table in sunglasses and a white T-shirt, giving a thumbs up. Brother Tommy, fresh off his win against Daniel Bocianski, was also seen tucking into a ‘victory burger’ as he exclaimed: ‘I’ve been waiting a long 12 weeks for this!’ After boxer Derek Chisora rocked up to join the party, Arg then popped up, enjoying the sunshine with his top off as he laughed and clapped along with the raucous group. Mark, 35, and Arg, 34, recently delighted fans with a reunion, 11 years on from presenter Mark’s Towie exit. Their outing comes after Mark helped Arg last year on his journey to health and fitness, following Arg’s weight gain, which he reversed by losing 13 stone. Showing that the bromance is still strong, Arg shared a snap of him posing with Mark in a London pub, with the two sharing a joke with their arms around one another. In an adorable caption written to his 841k Instagram followers, Arg wrote: ‘I get by with a little help from my friends #Marg 🤗 @wrighty_ ❤️’ Mark sweetly commented underneath the pic: ‘My guy’ Towie viewers branded them the ‘best friendship’ and said it was ‘great’ to see the ‘dynamic duo’ back together.
