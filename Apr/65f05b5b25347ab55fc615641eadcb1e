A Metropolitan Police officer has been found guilty of three child sex offences after attempting to meet a girl for sex. Detective Constable Francois Olwage tried to groom what he believed to be a 13-year-old child in an online chat room. But the 52-year-old from Stevenage was actually chatting to an undercover police officer calling themselves ‘Smile Bear’ and ‘Caitlin’ on WhatsApp. After two weeks of explicit sexual conversations in October 2021, Olwage arranged to meet the ‘girl’ who told him she lived in Hampshire. A court heard Olwage was ‘on duty working from home’ when he travelled by train to meet the ‘girl’ in a park in Basingstoke after going to McDonald’s. He was then arrested in the fast food restaurant by two undercover police officers. When searched, the officers found two condoms, a bottle of lubricant and a packet of Tadalafil erectile dysfunction tablets in his bag. There was also a box of Ferrero Rocher chocolates which prosecutors suggested was a present for the ‘girl’. Olwage said he ‘never believed’ Smile Bear was a 13-year-old girl and he thought it was an adult ‘playing out a fantasy’. He also denied having any sexual interest in children, but was found guilty of three offences at Winchester Crown Court. Olwage will now be remanded in custody until April 27, when he is sentenced.
