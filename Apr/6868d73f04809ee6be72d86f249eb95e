It’s the  Easter holidays in the UK, which means it’s time to entertain the kids. Family days out are super fun but the cost of keeping the children amused and fed can add up. If you’re looking for places to go that won’t break the bank, we’ve put together a list of places where kids can eat for free when they go with their grown-ups this Easter. One child can get a meal deal (which usually costs £3.95) for free at M&S cafés from April 4 to 22 when the grown-ups spend over a fiver in a single transaction. From Mondays to Thursdays, between the 28 February and 26 May, kids can order from YO! Sushi’s Mini Ninja children’s menu for free from 3.30pm to 5.30pm. One child can eat free with every £10 spent on food by the grown-ups. The Real Greek is also letting kids eat for free this Easter when the adults pay £10 for their own food, but the age limit is under 12 and that’s just on Sundays. ASDA and Morrison’s cafés are offering kids under 16 a free order off of the children’s menu from 3pm every day. At Morrison’s, the adults need to spend at least £4.50, and there’s a Feed The Family For A Tenner scheme on over the Easter break which means you can order two kid’s mains, two adult’s mains, and four drinks for £10 until April 24. At Beefeater, Table Table and Brewers Fayre, a maximum of two kids per one paying adult can eat breakfast for free, and Hungry Horse pubs are letting children eat free breakfasts every day from 8am to 12pm. At Angus Steakhouse, kids under 10 eat free when the adults order off the main menu from Monday to Sunday, from 12pm to 5pm until April 30. Do you have a story to share?
