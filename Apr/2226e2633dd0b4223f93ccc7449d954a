Easter is on its way and we are already excited for the delicious treats the holiday will offer up. Like Christmas, it’s a time to indulge, and one of the most beloved Easter foods is a traditional hot cross bun. The history of the hot cross bun ties in with the theme of Easter, as they are symbolic in the Christian faith. Each bun is decorated with a cross made from flour paste, which represents the cross on which Jesus Christ died. Meanwhile, the spices in hot cross buns are said to represent the spices that were used to embalm Christ after his death. However, you don’t need to be religious to enjoy a hot cross bun and they have become a staple of this time of year. While they are available to buy in most stores, nothing beats a homemade option. And surprisingly, they are quite an easy treat to whip up. Taking just 50 minutes in total to make, here is a simple hot cross bun recipe to feast on over the coming weeks. Enjoy!
