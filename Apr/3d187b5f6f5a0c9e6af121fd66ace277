In the market for a cheap home that needs a serious fix-up? Well, now is your chance if you live in or around County Durham. A two-bedroom house is about to go up for auction for just £40,000 but it will need a big overhaul. On the outside the terraced property in Darlington, County Durham, looks like a normal home – but the inside tells a different story. Unfortunately, there is moss and mould growing in the bedrooms and the hallway. Meanwhile, wires and pipework are exposed in both the kitchen and bathroom. The property is in a good location, close to the town centre and Darlington Memorial Hospital. North Lodge Park is also just a few minutes walk away. But it’s worth pointing out that the owner will not be considering offers before the auction takes place. For those with money and some renovation determination, it has all the makings of a steal. Yet, there is a considerable amount of work to be done. The images shared on the advert on RightMove highlight bright green smears across the floor and on a wall in the main bedroom. Other pictures show there are patches of mould and moss across other areas too. There is even black mould growing in the hallway. The property will be auctioned by Allsop on May 12 – for anyone looking for a huge project. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
