Brits will have two extra hours in the pub to raise a glass to Queen Elizabeth II on the Platinum Jubilee Bank Holiday Weekend. Opening times will be extended from 11pm to 1am to celebrate the British monarch becoming the first to mark 70 years on the throne. It will cover pubs, nightclubs and bars in England and Wales from Thursday 2 June to Saturday 4 June. MPs set out to approve the order in Parliament today, with just a month left until the four-day bonanza. Home Secretary Priti Patel has praised Her Majesty for serving the UK and the Commonwealth ‘with the utmost dignity, steadfastness and resolve’. She said: ’The Platinum Jubilee is a truly historic national occasion, which will see families, friends and communities across the country come together to celebrate this unprecedented landmark in a remarkable reign. ‘Over the extended bank holiday weekend, we will be able to raise a glass to toast Her Majesty’s incredible service to our country, while also providing a boost to the hospitality industry after a challenging couple of years.’ The Queen was ‘on sparkling form’ when she marked the huge milestone back in February. It remains uncertain what events she will attend in June as she faces ongoing mobility issues. But millions across the country are ready and raring to make it a weekend to remember – with street parties, exhibitions and a huge concert with the world’s biggest stars planned. It was yet another big day for the monarch on Thursday as she turned 96 years old. A 41-gun salute was fired in her honour, while the Coldstream Guards sang her happy birthday and her very own Barbie doll was unveiled. Buckingham Palace also gave the public a treat when they shared an adorable picture of the Queen aged two. In other royal news, Her Majesty’s great-grandson Louis marked his fourth birthday on Friday with a newly released photo. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
