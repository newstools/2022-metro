Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s 10-month-old daughter Lilibet has taken ‘her first steps’. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have travelled to the Netherlands for the Invictus Games, but had to leave their two children behind in California. In an interview with People magazine, Harry gushed over his daughter, who is named after the Queen. Describing himself as a ‘proud papa’, the duke said: ‘Her current priorities are trying to keep up with her brother. She took her first step just a few days ago.’ Meanwhile, little Archie, who is turning three next month, ‘loves’ watching videos of wheelchair basketball and rugby that his dad showed him from the previous Invictus Games in Sydney. ‘I showed him how some were missing legs and explained that some had invisible injuries too,’ Harry said. ‘Not because he asked, but because I wanted to tell him. Kids understand so much, and to see it through his eyes was amazing because it’s so unfiltered and honest.’ Harry added he ‘cannot wait’ to take Lilibet and Archie to the next Invictus Games, which are set to be held in Germany in 2023. Since launching the sporting event for wounded veterans and other military personnel in 2014, his personal life has changed greatly. ‘Being a dad certainly adds another emotional layer to it,’ the royal added. His interview comes just days after he and Meghan made a secret trip to the UK to visit the Queen in Windsor. Her Majesty is due to celebrate her Platinum Jubilee this summer and the couple have been invited to join her on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.
