We’re always on the hunt for ways to make cooking simpler and less messy. And broccoli is one of those ingredients that can get everywhere when it’s being prepared. But a new TikTok hack shows how to take the fuss out of prepping the green vegetable – to minimise the clear-up time. A user from the UK has gone viral with her unusual technique – which involves keeping the whole broccoli intact. In her clip, Stephanie can be seen placing the broccoli upside down in a pot of boiling water with the stem sticking out. She writes: ‘Turns out not everyone cooks their broccoli like this.’ Once the broccoli is cooked, she cuts the soft stem off and is left with the florets. The video, which has since received more than 13.3 million views, has certainly got the platform talking. However, it seems there’s a mixed reaction to her unorthodox way of preparing the vegetable. One person replied: ‘The reason I hate fresh broccoli/cauliflower is the cutting –  it gets everywhere.’ While another chipped in: ‘I’m 38 years old and just learned how to cook broccoli five seconds ago.’ But others have stressed that lots of the nutritional value is in the stem, which is discarded with this technique. What’s more, others say that this method encourages food waste. ‘The stem is the best part,’ someone else replied. While another added: ‘I am actually appalled at the stem wastage woah.’ It’s also worth pointing out that boiling vegetables can result in the loss of water-soluble vitamins – so it may not be as nutritious as roasting, steaming or blanching them.
