The Government has been urged to create a new permanent ‘thank holiday’ to honour the Queen. Brits are already getting an extra day off on June 3, to mark her Platinum Jubilee. But campaigners want to make the date permanent from next year. The move is being backed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and business groups the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Hospitality UK. The Chancellor Rishi Sunak is set to consider the proposals and is said to be onside, according to The Telegraph and The Express. The papers said under-fire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie are also supportive. As well as recognising the Queen’s ‘extraordinary service’, the new day off would also pay tribute to people’s efforts to support their communities, especially during the Covid crisis over the last two years. It is understood that Mr Sunak is yet to fully consider the proposals but he does intend to. According to The Telegraph, he has asked the Treasury for formal advice on the suggestion while Downing Street wants the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport (DCMS) to carry out a review of the matter. It cited a source as saying: ‘The Treasury is not saying no off the bat despite previously being institutionally allergic to the idea of a new bank holiday. ‘Rishi is supportive of the campaign and the thought behind it and has asked for all the projected costs.’ No 10 and the Treasury have been approached for comment. England and Wales is scheduled to have eight bank holidays in 2023 – a far smaller number than many other countries around the world.
