Chris Rock stepped back into the public eye this week while he continues to privately ‘process’ the shocking slapping incident with Will Smith at the Oscars. The legendary stand-up comedian took a solo stroll in New York City on Tuesday and looked fairly downcast as he hustled through the busy streets. With a pair of headphones around his neck, Chris, 57, appeared to be deep in thought as he passed other pedestrians and kept his head down at one point. Despite his superstar status, the Everybody Hates Chris creator blended in wearing a blue jacket, black T-shirt, grey combat trousers and sunglasses, but his bright multi-coloured trainers were hard to miss. It’s one of the few times Chris has been pictured out and about since the controversial events of the Oscars on March 27. During the live broadcast, King Richard actor Smith, 53, stormed on stage and smacked Chris across the face for joking about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith’s hair – the actress suffers from hair loss condition alopecia but sources say Chris was unaware of this. Smith was allowed to stay for the rest of the ceremony and later received the best actor award. However, he issued a public apology to Chris the following day and has since resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science. He will still face official disciplinary action from the Academy board this month and there are calls for him to be stripped of his Oscar. Chris has not addressed the incident in-depth publicly, but said at a recent stand-up show that he is ‘still processing’ what happened and will speak about it later in a ‘serious’ and ‘funny’ manner. Two of his brothers have made their feelings on the situation clear, with Kenny stating he doesn’t believe Smith’s apology was ‘genuine’. ‘I think his publicist and the people that work under him probably advised him to do that,’ Kenny told the Los Angeles Times. He added: ‘He should have been escorted out of there. I hold them accountable for that. He could have went up there and did anything you wanted to my brother. It could have been much worse than what he did. ‘[Smith] belittled my brother. He had no respect for him. … In my opinion, he embarrassed himself by doing that and his legacy by doing that.’ Chris’ other brother Tony, who is also a comedian, delivered a scathing takedown of Smith during his recent stand-up show, and said: ‘You gonna hit my motherf*****g brother because your b***h gave you a side-eye? ‘If you think you gonna walk up on this stage, this ain’t the mother******g Oscars. ‘And if you walk your a*s up here, you ain’t nominated for s**t but these motherf*****g hands. Oh, we are going to pop the rest of the year. Every time you see me do a show, pop!’ Got a story?
