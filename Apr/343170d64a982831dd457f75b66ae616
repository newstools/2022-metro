Elon Musk has weighed in on the current debate around Netflix’s reversal of fortunes. For the first time in its history, the streaming giant has lost subscribers after it admitted 200,000 paying customers left in the first quarter of 2022. And Musk puts it down to the ‘woke mind virus’ that he says is making Netflix ‘unwatchable’. The world’s richest man dropped the hot take on Twitter – which he is currently trying to buy – but didn’t elaborate on what the woke mind virus actually was. We’re guessing its some kind of jab at Netflix for trying to expand the amount of diverse content it offers to its millions of customers. All he said was that he’d like their sci-fi and fantasy content to be a bit more fantasy and sci-fi-related. Thankfully, one of his 80 million followers chimed in with some positive reinforcement. ‘Woke mind virus is the biggest threat to the civilization,’ wrote Pranay Pathole. The Tesla and SpaceX boss replied: ‘Yes.’ Netflix bosses also outlined how they expected to lose a further two million subscribers over the spring months and were considering drastic measures to curb the losses. This includes introducing an ad-supported subscription tier at a lower price and cracking down on users who share their passwords with others. Following the news, shares in the company fell 17% after hours. But it’s not just Netflix afflicted with Elon’s woke virus – according to another of his followers, all content is consumed by it. Though Netflix has released a variety of recent hits including Squid Game, Bridgerton, Sex Education, it has also produced ‘woke’ content such as He’s Expecting, which depicts a man who becomes pregnant. The company had also been forced to borrow $16 billion in a decade to cover its productions and business costs. Naturally, the suggestion on Twitter is that once Elon is done acquiring that social network he should go shopping for Netflix too.
