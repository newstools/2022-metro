Two children have died in hospital four days after being rescued from a house fire in Preston. Firefighters raced to the property in Coronation Crescent at 8pm on Friday following reports of several people trapped inside. A mother, aged in her 20s, and her two kids were carried from the burning building and rushed to hospital. Sadly, the three-year-old girl and five-year-old boy could not be saved and died after medical intervention was withdrawn on Tuesday. Their mother escaped the fire with non-life threatening injuries. A 24-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life has since been released with no further action. Detective chief inspector Rach Higson said: ‘This tragic incident has resulted in two children sadly losing their lives and my thoughts, first and foremost, are with their loved ones at this time. ‘Our inquiries into the cause of the fire are continuing.’ A joint investigation with Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service is being carried out to determine the cause of the fire. ‘A file will be passed on to HM Coroner in due course,’ a Lancashire Police spokesperson added.
