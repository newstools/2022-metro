Rob Key has told James Anderson and Stuart Broad they are available for England selection and says new Test captain Ben Stokes is keen for them to be recalled. Anderson and Broad were both left out of England’s tour to the Caribbean last month, with the team losing 1-0 in Joe Root’s last series in charge. Key, who was recently appointed as England’s new managing director, has reassured England’s two leading wicket-takers they will not be frozen out under the new regime. ‘Before it got announced that I got this job, I called them both up and said, “in my opinion, you’re both available for selection”,’ Key told Sky Sports. ‘I can’t promise you that you’re going to play but you’re available for selection. Ben Stokes has been very clear in the fact that he wants Jimmy and Broady to come back in. ‘Now, it will purely be done on what is the best XI to win that first Test match. Nothing more, nothing less. If they are in that – which they may well be because they’re two great bowlers – then they play.’ Anderson and Broad were both aggrieved not only at their omissions for the West Indies tour but also the way the situation was handled, with both claiming the news was broke in brief phone calls with interim director of cricket Sir Andrew Strauss. Asked how Anderson and Broad were following their omissions for England’s Test tour to West Indies, Key added: ‘They were fine actually, they just want to continue on this journey that they’ve been on. ‘They didn’t want it to finish in the way it could have done. They were obviously pleased to be up for selection for that first Test match.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
