Relations between Russia and the UK have hit an all-time low after Boris Johnson was banned from entering the country. The prime minister is banned from entering Russia, along with foreign secretary Liz Truss and defence secretary Ben Wallace. Russian state media confirmed the news, citing government sources. While the move will be seen as largely symbolic, it is another sign of the crumbling diplomatic relations between Moscow and London. The British government has continued to arm Ukraine’s military despite Kremlin warnings it would be look upon as direct conflict with Russia. Its foreign ministry said the move was taken ‘in view of the unprecedented hostile action by the British government, in particular the imposition of sanctions against senior Russian officials’. Dominic Raab, Priti Patel and Rishi Sunak are all on the ‘stop list’ issued by Russia. The UK government has imposed similar measured on people linked to Vladimir Putin, including government ministers, as part of wider action on sanctions. Both Ms Truss and Mr Wallace flew to Moscow for direct talks during last minute diplomatic efforts to avoid war in Ukraine.
