Floyd Mayweather will box another exhibition in May this year, taking on former sparring partner Don Moore on a helipad on top of the Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai. Since retiring from professional boxing, Mayweather has held exhibition bouts against Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa and YouTube star Logan Paul. After the Paul bout in June last year, his team suggested that was the last time we would see the 50-0 former world champion box, but he is coming back for another show. TMZ report that he will take on ‘Dangerous’ Don Moore on 14 May in Dubai in an eight-round exhibition, which will also feature some big names on the undercard. UFC legend Anderson Silva, who is enjoying success in boxing after beating Julio Cesar Chavez and Tito Ortiz last year, will box Brazilian MMA fighter Bruno Machado, while former boxing world champion Badou Jack will also fight. Don Moore is obviously not a household name, building a professional record of 18-0-1 at a pretty low level, and fighting just once since 2013. The unbeaten fighter used to spar Mayweather before the Money Man retired from the professional game and will presumably be earning a very decent pay packet for another sparring bout with Mayweather. There is a suggestion that this might not be the last we see of Mayweather, with the event in Dubai promoted by FrontRow and ROQU as the ‘Global Titans Fight Series’ although little is known about what that will become after show in the UAE.
