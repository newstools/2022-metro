A children’s entertainer has to find 1,000 new Easter eggs by Friday after throwing away his haul of Kinder Eggs. Radley Mason, 35, runs Radtastic Theatre and was planning on taking families in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on a train journey while acting out Red Riding Hood’s Easter egg hunt. He knows all too well what children expect to eat at Easter and made sure he had exactly 1,000 Kinder Eggs to give his guests, he told The Sun. Unfortunately for him, Kinder’s manufacturer, Ferrero, recalled a number of Kinder products over possible links to a salmonella outbreak in Europe. Radley had to bin the eggs but did not receive a refund for them. However, Ferrero told Metro.co.uk it issued Radley with vouchers instead. More than 100 suspected cases of salmonella, mostly in children under the age of 10, have been reported so far. Sad photos of a ‘poorly’ three-year-old girl who reportedly got salmonella from a Kinder Egg have been shared all over the internet. Her worried mum, believed to be from Dorset, said: ‘[My daughter] been completely dead behind the eyes and so lifeless, it’s been absolutely heartbreaking to see my usually fiery, adventurous and very active baby girl be the complete opposite of everything she usually is.’ A Kinder factory in Belgium thought to be behind the wave of cases has also been ordered to close, with its entire production line recalled. Belgium’s food safety authority AFSCA said any product made at the factory should be recalled, regardless of its expiration date. This is contrary to previous official advice, where only specific batches were classed as a potential danger. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
