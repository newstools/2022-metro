A teenage boy has been stabbed to death in south-east London. The 16-year-old was found in Lewisham on Wednesday afternoon and pronounced dead at the scene, with emergency powers now in place around the area. The youngster’s family have been informed but he is yet to be named. Officers were called to reports of a fight in Angus Street just after 4pm, Scotland Yard said. But despite the efforts of paramedics and an air ambulance being on the scene, he became the fourth teenage homicide in the capital this year. A record number of teenagers suffered violent deaths in London in 2021, with 30 homicides recorded by the Metropolitan Police, passing a previous peak of 29 in 2008. Police say no arrests have been made and that an investigation is underway – though they did not immediately call it a murder investigation. A Section 60 Order has been put in place in the whole borough of Lewisham, granting additional stop and search powers to police. The Met have appealed for witnesses to contact them. Those with information are asked to call 101 reference CAD 4776/13Apr. You can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
