Thousands of people have complained they have not been able to use Amazon’s Alexa this morning. Shortly after 8.30am there was a huge spike in reports of people’s devices failing to connect. It is not clear what was behind the disruption, as reported on Downdetector, a website that monitors online outages across a host of platforms. However, 93% of the issues reported to the site appear to be server connection problems. Issues with the virtual assistant were reported by customers in Kent, Plymouth, London, Norfolk and Newcastle. One user on Downdector commented: ‘Looks like it is a server problem and not my internet connection, nor wifi.. hopefully someone reboot their server soon..’ While a user in Kent said: ‘Been trying to connect for nearly 3 hours done factory reset and still won’t connect!’ Others said a number of devices in their homes, including Amazon Fire TV Sticks, were down, causing havoc. ‘Is this a sign of things to come? ‘I have my doorbell, heating system, lights, door lock….everything linked to Alexas around my house and this morning, none are working properly because Alexa is down, one person said’ ‘Might have to go back to the “old fashioned” way of things,’ Another commented: ‘Alexa is down again. Made my house a not so smart house. It’s like living back in the 90s.’ Problems appear to have spiked at around 10am, with reports of issues declining since. Amazon has not commented on the problems on its social media channels. Downdetector only reports an incident when the number of reports is significantly higher than the typical volume for that time of day.
