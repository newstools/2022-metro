It was reported The Voice UK was set for the axe, but ITV has confirmed it isn’t going anywhere for now. Anne-Marie, Olly Murs, Sir Tom Jones and will.i.am will be returning for another series of the famous singing contest later in 2022. The series sees one lucky talent secure a recording contract with Universal’s label UMOD if they manage to come out on top. However, after it emerged the entertainment programme looked set for the chop, the broadcaster quashed the claims. A show source told Metro.co.uk there is ‘absolutely no truth’ in reports the series will be axed. The Voice has already swapped from BBC to ITV, and has aired for 10 years in total. It comes just days after it was revealed Big Brother could be set to make a dramatic return to screens, likely to be on ITV2. The upcoming spin-off The Voice Kids is also set to continue on the broadcaster. The singing competition has already filmed every stage of the show, including the final after it was previously reported it would be pre-recorded to save costs. This means the upcoming series will have no shows in a huge shake-up. It will also see a fresh new addition to the format – The Callbacks – where contestants who made it through the Blind Auditions have the chance to battle it out for the semi-final. The Voice UK returns later this year to ITV. Got a story?
