Manchester City have apologised to Liverpool after some of their fans disrupted a tribute to the Hillsborough disaster before the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final between Premier League title rivals Man City and Liverpool took place almost 33 years to the day since the Hillsborough stadium disaster, in which 97 Liverpool fans died. The FA confirmed earlier this week that a moment of silence would be held before kick-off in tribute to the UK’s worst sporting disaster. But the minute’s silence was cut short by referee Michael Oliver after some Manchester City fans began chanting and booing. Liverpool fans reacted angrily in the stadium with jeers of their own. A Manchester City spokesperson said: ‘We are extremely disappointed with the actions of some City supporters during the minute’s silence before today’s game. ‘The club sincerely apologises to all those connected with Liverpool Football Club.’ There were reports of clashes between fans before the FA Cup semi-final and videos emerged of fights outside the stadium. While not traditionally considered major rivals, Manchester City and Liverpool have been the two best teams in England in recent years and are currently separated by just one point in the Premier League. Liverpool made a brilliant start to the Wembley fixture as they chase a historic quadruple, with Sadio Mane’s brace and Ibrahima Konate’s header putting Jurgen Klopp’s side 3-0 up at half-time. London rivals Chelsea and Crystal Palace feature in the second FA Cup semi-final tomorrow. For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
