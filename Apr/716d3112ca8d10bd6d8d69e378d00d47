Police have said Katie Price will face no legal action after filming members of the public from inside a courtroom. The My Crazy Life reality star appeared at Crawley Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday accused of breaching a restraining order against ex-husband Kieran Hayler’s fiancee Michelle Penticost, which she has denied. While inside the court, Price, 43, reportedly filmed a five-second clip showing members of the public, including photographers and press, standing outside the building and uploaded it to her Instagram stories. In the clip, she is heard saying: ‘That is my life today.’ It is against the law to take or try to take a photograph or film, make or try to make a portrait or sketch of a person in court, its building or within its precincts, or any person entering or leaving a court building, and to publish such a photo, film, portrait or sketch. However, Sussex Police have said they will ‘not be taking any further action’. They added in a statement to the MailOnline: ‘The legislation is considered to apply to judges, jurors, victims, witnesses and any other person involved in court proceedings whether it is criminal, civil or coronial. ‘A person taking a picture from inside the court which shows members of the press or public outside of the court does not meet the criteria or the spirit of this legislation, which is designed to protect the identity of those involved in court proceedings.’ Price is said to have sent her ex-husband Hayler a message on January 21, 2022 branding his new partner, Penticost, a ‘c***ing wh**e’ and a ‘gutter s**g’, while also accusing them of having an affair. The former glamour model was banned from contacting Penticost directly or indirectly on June 3 2019, under the terms of a five-year restraining order while also being fined hundreds of pounds for hurling a foul-mouthed ‘tirade of abuse’ at her during a row in a school playground. The court heard that Price’s message to Hayler may have been triggered by an Instagram post by Penticost, which she denies was aimed at Price. Price’s message read: ‘Tell your ****ing wh**e, piece of s**t, girlfriend not to start on me. ‘She has a restraining order so shouldn’t try antagonise me as she is in breach and I’m sure she doesn’t want people knowing that she was having an affair with you behind my back. That gutter s**g.’ The reality star pleaded not guilty to the single charge, which can be tried in either the magistrates’ court or the Crown Court. Asked where she wanted the trial to be heard, Price said: ‘The Crown Court please.’ District Judge Amanda Kelly said the offence carries a maximum sentence of up to five years’ imprisonment and warned Price: ‘You are in really grave danger of going to prison.’ The judge granted Price bail ahead of a plea and trial preparation hearing on May 25 at Lewes Crown Court on condition she does not contact Penticost either directly or indirectly, except for handing over children.
