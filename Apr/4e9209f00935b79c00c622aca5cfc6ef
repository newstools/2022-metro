Burnley have sacked manager Sean Dyche after almost 10 years in charge as they fight for their Premier League survival. During Dyche’s reign at Turf Moor – which began in 2012 – Burnley secured two promotions from the Championship, achieved two top-half Premier League finishes and qualified for Europe for the first time in 51 years. But the club have endured a dismal season, winning just four games to slip into the relegation places, four points behind 17th-placed Everton with eight games remaining. The Clarets secured a vital 3-2 win over relegation-rivals Everton earlier in the month but lost 2-0 to bottom-placed Norwich City on Sunday in Dyche’s last game in charge. Burnley chairman Alan Pace said: ‘Firstly, we would like to place on record our sincere thanks to Sean and his staff for their achievements at the Club over the last decade. ‘During his time at Turf Moor, Sean has been a credit both on and off the pitch, respected by players, staff, supporters, and the wider football community. ‘However, results this season have been disappointing and, while this was an incredibly difficult decision, with eight crucial games of the campaign remaining, we feel a change is needed to give the squad the best possible chance of retaining its Premier League status. ‘The process of replacing Sean has begun and further announcements will be made to supporters in due course.’ Assistant manager Ian Woan, first-team coach Steve Stone and goalkeeping coach Billy Mercer have also left Burnley, who face Europa League semi-finalists West Ham this weekend. Burnley have confirmed that U23 coach Mike Jackson, assisted by academy director Paul Jenkins, U23 goalkeeping coach Connor King and club captain Ben Mee will take charge of the team for Sunday’s game at Turf Moor.
