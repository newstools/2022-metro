Prince Charles has been pictured showing visitors around his country estate ahead of its seasonal opening to the public. The future King took a group of tour guides on a walk through the daffodils at Highgrove Gardens in Gloucestershire. Wearing a red-patterned tie and white shirt beneath a green coat for the occasion, the future king spoke about his favourite flowers and trees, and the reasons for including them in the garden’s collection this season. More than 60 garden guides are employed at the estate by The Prince’s Foundation, and many joined Charles for an induction ahead of the 2022 tours season. Each year, the estate, which is home to an Orchard Tea Room, typically welcomes around 40,000 visitors. The latest pictures of Charles comes after his disgraced brother Prince Andrew  took centre stage at a memorial service for their father Prince Philip earlier this week. Andrew accompanied the Queen to Westminster Abbey and leant her an arm as she walked to her seat. The move has reportedly led some in the royal family to accuse the Duke of York of trying to worm his way back into the limelight following his sex scandal. However, both Charles and Prince William are said to be vehemently against any involvement of his in the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June. ‘I don’t expect we will see Prince Andrew appear in the near future – if ever again,’ royal expert Richard Fitzwilliam told The Mirror. ‘He won’t play any kind of role in the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, of that I think we can be quite sure. ‘Prince Charles and William will be totally opposed to it, it’s a non-starter.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
