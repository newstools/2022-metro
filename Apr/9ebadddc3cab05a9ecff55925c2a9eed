The Government’s former ethics chief has apologised after being fined by police over the partygate scandal. Helen MacNamara said she has paid a police fine after reportedly being reprimanded by officers over a leaving do held. Ms MacNamara attended a raucous ‘lockdown’ karaoke party which included a drunken brawl, according to the Telegraph. The paper reported that Ms MacNamara’s karaoke machine was used at a leaving do for Downing Street aide Hannah Young – adding that she was among the first group of people to receive a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN) £50 fine on Friday after police concluded she had broken Covid laws. She said: ‘I am sorry for the error of judgement I have shown. I have accepted and paid the fixed penalty notice.’ The event is said to have taken place in the Cabinet Secretary’s Whitehall office when all indoor gatherings were banned and the public were being told not to sing in public. It took place on June 18, 2020, less than three months after the UK’s first Covid lockdown was announced. Ms MacNamara, who was in charge of Whitehall propriety and ethics at the time, but now works for the Premier League, is the first to confirm they have paid a penalty. The aide was referred to by Dominic Cummings in evidence he gave to Parliament, in which he claimed she walked in to a Downing Street meeting and said ‘I think we are all absolutely f***ed’ at the beginning of the pandemic. The fine will add to growing speculation about whether the Prime Minister will be fined by the Metropolitan Police – and whether that means he should resign over breaking his own Covid laws.
