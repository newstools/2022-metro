Chester Zoo celebrated the birth of twin red-bellied lemurs, one of the world’s most endangered primates. Rare footage shows the ‘absolutely tiny’ pair, weighing 70 grams each, nestled in their mum Aina’s thick fur. Zookeepers were thrilled about the birth, not only because the newborns are so adorable, but because their population is rapidly decreasing. Jessamine Smith, keeper at Chester Zoo, said the new additions are ‘incredibly special’. ‘The birth of any red-bellied lemur is always a real boost for the conservation breeding programme, but to have twins born for the very first time at the zoo is incredibly special,’ she said. ‘At the moment they’re absolutely tiny, but they develop really quickly and within a few months will be off exploring the treetops by themselves.’ Ms Smith said the species is one of the few that form a monogamous couple, meaning they ‘pair up for life and live in a small family troop of mum, dad, and their offspring’. ‘So far mum Aina and dad Frej are both doing a wonderful job of caring for their new babies. ‘They can often be seen snuggled up in mum’s fur and clinging tightly to her as she leaps from tree to tree,’ the zookeeper revealed. Native to Madagascar, the red-bellied lemurs are ‘undergoing a sharp decline’. Their number has gone down by more than 30% in recent years and the new additions are an important boost to the European breeding programme. Mike Jordan, director of animals and plants at the zoo, said: ‘Red-bellied lemurs are sadly undergoing a sharp decline in Madagascar, meaning the safety net population found in leading zoos around the world is becoming ever more important. ‘The arrival of these two new babies will help us continue to play a vital role in ensuring the species has a future.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
