We use dishwashers every day, and yet take for granted that we don’t know how they actually work. For many of us, its a case of simply loading dirty dishes into the void and then unloading them sparkly clean an hour and a half later. When you stop to think about it, you might realise that you don’t know how exactly those dishes get transformed, but thanks to a TikTok video, that is one life mystery that we can now put to bed. TikTok user Happyhome083 posted a clip of their dishwasher with a see-through door in action — and with the clip amassing 9 million views, its clear people are losing their mind over finding out how dishwashers actually work — a lifelong mystery that’s always been there, but we’ve somehow ignored. As it turns out, the way a dishwasher works is more simple than you might think. From the video, you can see what appears to be spinning arms from the bottom spraying water all over the area. Kind of similar to those automated car washing machines. I’m no rocket scientist, but as a dishwasher user myself, I think we can assume that the dishwasher tablet dissolves and mixes with the water to get your dishes sparkly clean. People took to the comments to explain how they were entranced by the unveiling of this kitchenware-related mystery. ‘I’ve waited my whole life to see this,’ one user remarked. ‘I always thought it filled up like a washing machine!’ another revealed. ‘Did anyone think it worked differently?’ a third user asked. ‘I can’t own one of these,’ a further comment read. ‘I’d stare at it the whole cycle and not get anything else done.’ You and me both.
