Michael Owen has delivered his predictions for this weekend’s Premier League fixtures, backing Liverpool to secure a crucial victory over title rivals Manchester City and Chelsea to return to winning ways against Southampton. Liverpool and Man City – separated by just one point after 30 league games – go head-to-head at the Etihad on Sunday in a fixture that is expected to go a long way to deciding the outcome of the title race. Elsewhere, relegation-threatened Everton will be desperate to pick up some points against Ralf Rangnick’s inconsistent Manchester United and Arsenal will look to boost their top-four hopes against Brighton. Chelsea, on the back of two successive defeats, are also in action against Southampton, while Watford could enhance their survival chances as they welcome Leeds United to Vicarage Road. On Manchester City’s clash with Liverpool – which Owen sees as the ‘biggest game of the season’ – the former England striker told BetVictor: ‘I can’t wait for this one. ‘I thought City played well against Atletico in midweek, it’s obviously never easy or particularly enjoyable playing against Diego Simeone’s side. ‘However, I think Man City aren’t quite firing on all cylinders in the final third, they haven’t been as prolific of late. ‘It was a good game in Lisbon against Benfica and Liverpool probably deserved that 3-1 win. It was probably an ideal warm up game for Liverpool, Benfica tried to take the game to them. ‘I’ve been saying it since he signed, Luis Diaz belongs in this side. He’s given this side even more threat and I wouldn’t be shocked at all if he played a big part in this one. ‘This game could go either way, but I’m going for Liverpool. I think they’re going into this with a bit more momentum than City and they have a little bit more attacking spark and threat. 2-1 to Liverpool.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
