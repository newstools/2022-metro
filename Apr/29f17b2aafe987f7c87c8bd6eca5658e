Who is this woman and what has she done with Denise Welch, please? The Loose Women star, 63, has been playing around with wigs and filters and looks genuinely unrecognisable in her latest Instagram post. Swapping her trademark short hairdo for a longer blonde wig, she donned some bright peach and pink clothes and a pair of very fetching glasses. ‘Playing around with wigs and a ‘smidge’ of a filter with @glambypamelab,’ she wrote. ‘I now feel the need for an ‘interview look’ every time I go to the bloody shops!!! 💄💋💅😎🥵🥵🥵.’ Denise’s husband Lincoln Townley was particularly impressed, writing: ‘I’m having that WIG @denise_welch IMMEDIATELY.’ Get in line, Lincoln! Fans couldn’t believe it either, with one writing: ‘Doesn’t even look like u!!! Wow 👏’, while another added: ‘Looking good in the disguise x’. The snap came after Denise attended the GLAAD Awards this week, looking a little more herself in a sparkly red jacket with matching heels and lippie. ‘@glaad awards celebrates the media who show inclusion & representation of the LGBGTQ community in Hollywood,’ she wrote on Instagram. ‘I was proud to be there as an ally & will be posting a million more photos when I wake up!!!’ Meanwhile, she also recently celebrated International Women’s Day with the rest of the ITV daytime ladies, with the gang taking an adorable snap. In the official pictures Rochelle Humes, Alison Hammond, Linda Robson and the rest of the crew were seen smiling from ear to ear while dressed in various shades of red, pink, maroon and orange to mark the occasion. Sophie Morgan, Susanna Reid, Charlene White, Charlotte Hawkins, Josie Gibson, Nadia Sawalha, Laura Tobin, Janet Street-Porter, Gloria Hunniford, Kelle Bryan, Katie Piper, Christine Lampard, Ranvir Singh, and Penny Lancaster also completed the star-studded lineup.
