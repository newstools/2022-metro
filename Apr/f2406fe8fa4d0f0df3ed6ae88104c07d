No one really knows what happens after you die. Do you arrive at the pearly gates, receive a ‘you’ve completed life’ certificate and get informed about your eternal fate? Or do you just slip into the heaviest sleep you’ve ever had? Well, Gordon Blakeman didn’t even know he was dead. It was hidden from him so well that he had to anticlimactically find out about it in a letter – from a financial company. Gordon came out of hospital last Sunday and two days later, he and his partner Leigh received a letter at their home in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, sending condolences to anyone grieving Gordon. A finance company, which the couple had used for years, wrote to Leigh: ‘To the executor of the late Gordon Blakeman. ‘We are sorry to hear about the loss of Gordon Blakeman and extend our condolences to you at this difficult time.’ Leigh told the Bromsgrove Standard: ‘We couldn’t believe what we were reading – we thought it might be some practical joke.’ When the couple called the company, they were told their bank NatWest had incorrectly recorded Gordon as dead. It turns out a worker at NatWest had made the mistake while dealing with a query for Gordon. The bank issued a statement saying: ‘We sincerely apologise to our customers for this mistake, which happened as a result of human error. ‘We completely understand that this caused them some distress, so we have apologised directly and offered compensation.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
