A man accused of murdering four members of the same family gestured to a relative in the public gallery as he was led back to the cells. Joshua Jacques has been charged with stabbing to death three generations of the family at their home in Bermondsey, south east London, on Monday. The 28-year-old was seen to make a saluting motion with his finger to a woman – reportedly an aunt – who watched the proceedings, near to where grieving relations of the deceased were sitting. His girlfriend Samantha Drummonds, 27, was among those killed in the brutal slaying. Jamaican-born NHS worker Dolet Hill, 64, and her partner Denton Burke, 58, were also found stabbed at their home in Delaford Road. Ms Hill’s daughter, Tanysha Drummonds, 45, also known as Rachquel and previously named by police as Tanysha Ofori-Akuffo, died alongside them at the property. Mr Jacques was taken to hospital from the address and treated for injuries after reportedly being tasered by police. He appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court wearing a grey tracksuit and facing four counts of murder. He spoke only to confirm his details during the brief hearing. The defendant appeared to gesture to a woman as he was walking out of the dock. Bereaved family members of the deceased sat in a separate area of the gallery to listen to the hearing. District Judge Daniel Sternberg sent the case to the Old Bailey for a further hearing on 3 May. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
