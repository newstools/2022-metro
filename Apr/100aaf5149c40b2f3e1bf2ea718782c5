A shy singer’s music will finally be performed in public – when his songs are played at his own funeral. Lee Herbert, 42, secretly recorded thousands of cover songs but was too private to sing them out loud. His family say Lee had ‘an amazing voice’ and will play the songs to mourners at his funeral. They only discovered his treasure trove of recordings, which he anonymously shared online, following his unexpected and sudden death earlier this month. His sister Katie said: ‘We’ve always known Lee had a truly amazing voice. ‘But because he was so shy and quiet the only place I could ever get to sing with him was in the car. ‘I spoke to my brother George and he agreed we really must have Lee singing at his own funeral. ‘Lee could sing pretty much everything from any given artist – Paul Young, Wet Wet Wet and Ed Sheeran to name but a few. ‘He was a very artistic guy who could really harmonize, yet so unassuming.‘No one ever had a bad word to say about Lee. He was a very caring person, always there if needed.’ The Cardigan Post Office worker’s songs will be played during the service at Narberth Crematorium, south Wales, this Friday. Katie added: ‘It’ll be so nice to share Lee’s singing with everyone who comes to his funeral at Narberth on April 16. ‘We want as many people to attend as possible, to show just how loved he was. ‘I like to think we’ll all be turning a huge negative into a massive positive.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
