Celebrities like Zendaya and Billie Eilish are already on the trend. Flippy or flicky hair ends are back in style, and while you might associate this look with being ‘prim and proper’, it can elevate simple straight lengths. Worn sleek it can appear smart, or with choppy layers it can give off a 70s vibe. It’s easy to do yourself at home, or ask for a professional to do in a blow dry. Ricky Walters, founder of Salon64, says: ‘Flicky hair is essentially hair that has been styled with a slight bend on the end – it’s certainly not a curl or wave. ‘It’s having a moment again because 90s fashion and 60s inspired clothing has all made a huge come back over recent years – and everyone wants the hair to match. ‘Netflix has plenty to answer for with shows like the Queen’s Gambit having all amazingly styled. This is all the modern-day inspiration to how to wear your hair.’ To create the look at home, he says: ‘Shampoo and conditioner is always your ultimate prep product, but don’t use anything too heavy as that will weigh the hair down. Lightness is important here. ‘I recommend Viva La Shine Shampoo and Conditioner by Salon64, which is designed to be lightweight. ‘Then use a round bristle brush to create the flick, using a hairdryer to mould the hair. ‘The smaller the brush the more of a bend. The larger the brush the more subtle the movement. ‘Spray in a little volume spray to help the flicks and style hold in place.’ If you want to go to a hairdresser to have professional styling, always take a picture to show exactly how tight or loose you want the flicks to look.
