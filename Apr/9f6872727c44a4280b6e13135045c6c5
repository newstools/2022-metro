A ‘complex’ murder investigation has been launched after a much-loved couple were found dead in their home. The bodies of Susan and Jeffrey Farrance – both in their sixties – were discovered inside a sheltered accommodation building in Bourne End, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday. A third man, in his fifties, was also found dead. Officers say he was known to Susan and Jeffrey. Police had attended the property shortly before 10pm and found evidence to suggest ‘a serious assault’ had occurred. They added the three died in a ‘targeted attack’. Detective superintendent Kevin Brown said: ‘We have launched a murder investigation after the discovery of three people deceased within the property. ‘The next of kin have been informed and are being supported by specially trained officers, our thoughts remain with them at this most difficult time. ‘We are in the very early stages of this investigation and we are dealing with a very complex enquiry, which appears a targeted attack. ‘We are not looking for anyone else in connection with it.’ Susan and Jeffrey’s neighbours, who live in the Orchard House sheltered accommodation, said they woke up to the sounds of the emergency services arriving. One resident told the Sun: ‘I woke up find to armed officers with guns, going bang bang bang and I saw forensic science officers later. ‘The attack took place in the main foyer of the flats. ‘Everyone who goes in or out has to sign their name. Last night it was chaos.’ Police will remain on the scene while investigations continue. Red Kite Housing, which runs Orchard House, posted on Facebook that it was ‘with shock and great sadness that we can confirm three people were found deceased at Orchard House, Blind Lane, Bourne End.’ A spokesperson added: ‘We are currently working with the police to help assist with their investigation.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
