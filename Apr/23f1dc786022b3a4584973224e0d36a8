Britney Spears has announced that she is pregnant with her third child – her first with fiancé Sam Asghari. The Toxic singer, who shares sons Jayden and Sean with ex-husband Kevin Federline, appeared to confirm her baby news on Instagram. Taking to the social media platform, the 40-year-old shared a snap of pink flowers by a cup of coffee, in a pink cup and saucer. ‘I lost so much weight to go on my Maui trip only to gain it back,’ she began the lengthy post, describing Sam as her ‘husband’. ‘I thought “Geez… What happened to my stomach???” ‘My husband said, “No you’re food pregnant silly!!!” So I got a pregnancy test…and uhhhhh well… I am having a baby… 👶🏼 ‘4 days later I got a little more food pregnant 🤰🏼🙈🙈🙈 It’s growing !!! If 2 are in there… I might just loose it… I obviously won’t be going out as much due to the paps getting their money shot of me like they unfortunately already have.’ Speaking about the tough time she had in a previous pregnancy, Britney continued: ’It’s hard because when I was pregnant I had perinatal depression… I have to say it is absolutely horrible… ‘Women didn’t talk about it back then… Some people considered it dangerous if a woman complained like that with a baby inside her… ‘But now women talk about it everyday… thank Jesus we don’t have to keep that pain a reserved proper secret…’ She concluded the post: ‘This time I will be doing yoga every day!!! Spreading lots of joy and love!!!’ Right on cue, fans rushed to congratulate the expectant mom over her baby joy – while some were a little puzzled by how casual the announcement was. Pal Paris Hilton led the love-in with the message: ‘Congratulations sis!! 🥳 I’m so excited for you!!😍 Love you!!!’ One wrote: ‘CONGRATULATIONS BRIT OMG. Sending you so much love!!’ An Instagram user replied: ‘Congratulations B .. Crying tears of joy for you! Take it easy okay love ya!’ ‘Sending you so much love, Britney! XO XO XO,’ another said. ‘Congratulations and God bless,’ a follower added. Britney first met Sam in 2016, when she hired him to appear as her love interest in her Slumber Party music video. They started dating soon after and have been inseparable ever since, with the personal trainer sticking by the musician’s side during much her conservatorship ordeal. After being freed from her court order last year, she recently shared how much she wanted to start a family with her beau. Just last month, she marked Sam’s birthday with a sweet snap of the two taking in a sunset together on an idyllic beach. ‘Happy Birthday to my Fiancé… I love you so much…,’ she said at the time. ’I want a family with you… I want it all with you!!!!’ Well, it looks like Brit is finally getting her wish. This will be the first baby for the couple, and Sam’s first child – the Gimme More star welcomed son Sean in 2005, and Jayden the following year, with ex Kevin. Britney previously revealed that she wanted to have children with her partner but was blocked from doing so due to her conservatorship. In shocking testimony last year, she explained that she was banned from removing her IUD – a method of birth control that is inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. ‘I have an IUD in my body right now that won’t let me have a baby and my conservators won’t let me go to the doctor to take it out,’ she told the court. ‘I feel ganged up on. I feel bullied and I feel left out and alone. I want to be able to get married and have a baby.’ The controversial court order was put in place in 2008, with Britney’s dad Jamie Spears in charge of her wellbeing and financial matters. It was terminated in November after 13 years, with the superstar since regaining control of her life. Metro.co.uk has contacted Britney’s reps for a comment. Got a story?
