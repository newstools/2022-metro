Thomas Tuchel has urged Timo Werner to start ‘helping himself’ after he scored twice in Chelsea’s 6-0 win over Southampton on Saturday. The Germany international has struggled to make an impact at Chelsea since his £47.5 million move from RB Leipzig in 2020. Werner has scored just three goals in the Premier League this season and has been unable to secure a regular role in the team despite Romelu Lukaku struggling for form. The 26-year-old scored a double in the comfortable victory over Southampton which has kept Chelsea third in the Premier League, but Tuchel believes the striker should not need constant motivation in order to improve. Asked if he had spoken to Werner in order to motivate him, Tuchel replied after the win at Southampton: ‘Yeah, but it would have been a long talk from October until April. ‘At some point there are no words, you must help yourself. You sign for Chelsea, you sign for a top club, you have to live up to it and accept the pressure that comes with it. And you also have to help yourself. ‘It means when you come on the pitch, you have to be ready when the chance comes, and this is what he did. ‘His attitude has always been good. But he still needs to adapt, because he used to play regularly and used to play for teams that were built for him. ‘He played for a transition team before and sometimes we have lots of possession. ‘Werner needs to adapt to the physicality of the league. It’s still a process but it was a step in the right direction.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
