A man has been fined after he was filmed kicking a hedgehog down a garden path. David Herring, 53, claimed he carried out the attack because he ‘thought it was a rat’. The incident took place in Sudbury, in Suffolk, last November. Herring, who was making a milk delivery, was seen moving the animal from a doorway before kicking it several times. The spiky mammal had been eating food left out by homeowner Ellen Burrows. She told the Sun: ‘When my husband showed me the video of the milkman kicking this defenceless hedgehog for no reason, I was furious. ‘You could see him digging it out with his foot and then kicking it down the path so it rolled a bit. ‘Then he kicked it again straight down the path out to the front of our house.’ Footage of the assault was sent to the RSPCA, who subsequently launched an investigation. Herring, of Manor Road in Sudbury, was said to show ‘a clear disregard’ for the small animal. Appearing at Colchester Magistrates Court, he admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the hedgehog. He was fined £277 and ordered to pay £300 in additional costs and a £34 victim surcharge. RSPCA inspector Caroline Richardson said: ‘Having reviewed video footage it was clear the hedgehog was kicked with considerable force. ‘The final kick can clearly be heard on the camera footage. The hedgehog rolls at speed several metres out of sight.’ A vet examined the footage and had determined that its suffering would have been extended following the assault. Caroline added: ‘This was an incident which showed a clear disregard for a wild animal.’ The court heard Herring had been under a lot of stress leading up to the incident, due to a heart attack within the last year. He was said to be of previous good character – and his legal team said he kicked the hedgehog as he believed it was a rat. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
