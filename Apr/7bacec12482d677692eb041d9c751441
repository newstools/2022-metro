Boots has announced plans to remove all wet wipes that contain plastic fibres from its shelves by the end of 2022. Plant-based biodegradable alternatives will arrive instead, as part of a wider sustainability initiative. Boots is one of the biggest sellers of wet wipes in the UK – 15% of all wipes sold are from Boots, and over 800million were bought from the retailer in 2021. Wet wipes feature in over 140 different lines stocked across skincare, beauty, baby, tissue and healthcare. A large proportion of the 11billion wet wipes used in the UK every year contain some form of plastic. There is evidence to suggest they are the cause of more than nine in ten of the blockages in sewers. The Marine Conservation Society reported that in September 2021 alone, volunteers found nearly 6,000 wet wipes, which is an average of 12 and a half wet wipes for every 100 metres of beach surveyed. Steve Ager, chief customer and commercial officer at Boots, said: ‘Our customers are more aware than ever before of their impact on the environment, and they are actively looking to brands and retailers to help them lead more sustainable lives. ‘We removed plastics from our own brand and No7 wet wipe ranges in 2021, and now we are calling on other brands and retailers across the UK to follow suit in eliminating all plastic-based wet wipes. ‘We all have a responsibility to protect our planet. By joining forces to inspire more positive action, we can collectively make a big difference.’ Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
