Ronnie O’Sullivan could face disciplinary action after he was caught making a lewd gesture during at the 2022 World Snooker Championship. The world No.1 beat David Gilbert 10-5 in his first-round match at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield on Sunday evening. But during the 13th frame, O’Sullivan made the rude gesture with his hand after failing to pot a routine black from the spot. Fellow snooker pro, Matt Selt, was watching the match and posted the clip on his Instagram account along with the ironic caption: ‘What an ambassador’. At the World Championship in 2013, O’Sullivan was warned by referee Michaela Tabb for making what she perceived to be an obscene gesture with his cue in his semi-final against Judd Trump. After beating Gilbert on Sunday, O’Sullivan will face either Mark Allen or Scott Donaldson in the second later this week. Speaking last week in an exclusive interview with Metro.co.uk, O’Sullivan was slammed by world No.18 Hossein Vafaei, who claimed The Rocket is ‘not good for the game’. ‘To be honest, Ronnie O’Sullivan without his team, without the people who are around him, he wouldn’t be here at all. He wouldn’t be here at all,’ said Vafaei. ‘He’s comparing himself with someone else. He’s comparing me with someone else. I don’t like that. We don’t have to compare ourselves to others. He’s saying you are poor, I am rich, I am Ronnie O’Sullivan. I don’t like that. I have money, my people in Iran have money, but we have to respect human beings as well. ‘I don’t want to get involved in that kind of conversation really. I like him a lot, I am his fan, I love what he does but sometimes he’s disrespectful, he’s not good for the game. ‘I think he should retire, to be honest with you. He should retire and then the younger generation make the game bigger.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
