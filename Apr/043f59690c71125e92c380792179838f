It was supposed to be their pride and joy, but instead it’s now a mangled wreck. This is the aftermath of a very expensive crash that happened earlier today. It shows a £250,000 supercar that crashed on the same day that the owner bought it – just two miles away from the dealership. The luxury car is believed to be a Ferrari 488. Photos shared by police show the front bonnet crumpled with scratches all across the front of the flashy red sports car. The driver, who was uninjured, was left counting the cost after his pride and joy was involved in the collision shortly after he purchased the car in Derby. Derbyshire Police said: ‘Derby. 1st April. Driver bought a Ferrari this morning and crashed it after driving it less than 2 miles. No injuries. #DriveToArrive.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
