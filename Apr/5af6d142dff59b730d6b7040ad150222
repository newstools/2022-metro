A recall of Kinder Surprise eggs has been extended to more products after dozens of children fell ill with salmonella. Some Kinder Mini Eggs, Kinder Egg Hunt Kits and Kinder Schokobons could also be contaminated, the Food Standards Agency warned today. It comes after more than 60 UK cases of salmonella were linked to Kinder Surprise eggs when the company raised the alarm on Monday. Around 40 of these cases involve children aged five and under. No deaths have been reported, the FSA said at the start of the week. The new products that could be affected include 20g, 100g and three-pack 20g Kinder Surprises. Kinder Mini Eggs that weigh 75g, 150g Kinder Egg Hunt Kits and 200g Kinder Schokobons have also been included in the caution. All best before dates are from 20 April 2022 up to and including August 21, 2022. Two days ago, 20g eggs and three-packs of eggs with a best-before date between July 11 2022 and October 7 2022 were recalled. Customers who have bought the treats are advised not to eat them, although the toys inside won’t be impacted. Salmonella symptoms to watch out for include fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Most cases improve in a few days, although some can be severe and lead to hospital admission, especially in the very young and those with weakened immune systems. Investigations so far have been led by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland.
