A female MP has accused a Labour shadow cabinet minister of branding her a ‘secret weapon’ for the party, because men want to have sex with her. The unnamed politician says she has not made a complaint about the issue since she does not think it is in her interest to do so or be identified. Sir Keir Starmer’s party says it would take any complaint ‘extremely seriously’ if made. The accusation comes amid renewed scrutiny on sexism and misogyny at Westminster. It follows Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner being accused of crossing and uncrossing her legs to ‘distract the Prime Minister’ by an unnamed Tory MP, and as another Conservative was accused of watching porn in the Commons. The latest revelation saw BBC Wales report that the Labour MP was described as being a ‘rising star’ for the party at an event. She claimed that before she could reply, the shadow cabinet member labelled her ‘a secret weapon’ because ‘women want to be her friend’ and men want to sleep with her. ‘She is a vote winner’, they said. A Labour spokesman responded: ‘The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously. ‘They are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate action is taken.’ It is understood no complaint has been made, but the party would encourage anyone with a complaint to come forward. Westminster has once again been rocked by claims about lewd behaviour in recent days, while dozens of MPs – including three Cabinet ministers – reportedly face allegations of sexual misconduct. Meanwhile, a panel has found that a Labour MP should be suspended for two days for bullying an assistant. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
