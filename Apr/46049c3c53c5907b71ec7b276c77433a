NFL quarterback Dwayne Haskins has died at the age of 24 after being struck by a car in south Florida, according to his agent. The Pittsburgh Steelers star was training in Florida with other quarterbacks, running backs and wide receivers. His agent Cedric Saunders says he was killed on Saturday morning when he was struck by a vehicle. Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said: ‘I am devastated and at a loss for words with the unfortunate passing of Dwayne Haskins. ‘He quickly became part of our Steelers family upon his arrival in Pittsburgh and was one of our hardest workers, both on the field and in our community. ‘Dwayne was a great teammate, but even more so a tremendous friend to so many. I am truly heartbroken. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Kalabrya, and his entire family during this difficult time.’ After graduating from Ohio State University, Haskins was selected 15th overall by the Washington Commanders in the 2019 season draft. He spent two mixed seasons with Washington before being released and signing for Pittsburgh ahead of the 2021 campaign. While Haskins failed to make a regular-season appearance with the Steelers last year, he was expected to compete for a starting place following the retirement of Ben Roethlisberger. Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray paid tribute to Haskins on social media, tweeting: ‘RIP Dwayne Haskins.. heartbreaking… Prayers to his family and loved ones. Love yours while they’re here!’ Chicago Cubs baseball star Marcus Stroman added: ‘Heartbreaking. RIP Dwayne Haskins! Sending blessings and prayers to his family. Life is precious. ‘We’re always reminded. Incredibly sad to see young kings and queens, with their entire life ahead of them, gone too soon. Love your people and find your happiness daily!’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
