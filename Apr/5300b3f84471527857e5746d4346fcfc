Antonio Rudiger has set a deadline of the end of April for Chelsea to offer him a new deal, with the defender keen to resolve his future once and for all. The Germany international is out of contract this summer and he’s attracted attention from Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester United and Bayern Munich. The 29-year-old rejected two contract offers from Chelsea earlier this year, with Rudiger feeling that he is deserving of a salary that puts him alongside the club’s highest earners. Following the UK government’s decision to sanction Roman Abramovich, Chelsea are currently unable to offer a new contract to Rudiger, nor hold negotiations with the German’s representatives. The club hope to complete a takeover in the coming weeks but the Athletic report that any successful bid is likely to come after Rudiger’s deadline of May 1st. The German wants to resolve his future in the next ten days so that he can end the speculation surrounding him. He is also wary of sustaining a major injury in the final weeks of the season, which would put off potential suitors – perhaps even Chelsea. Rudiger currently earns around £90,000-a-week but he wants parity with N’Golo Kante on £220,000-a-week.
