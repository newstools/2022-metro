A British fighter in Ukraine has been paraded on TV after he was captured by Russian forces. He has been named as father-of-four Andrew Hill, from Plymouth. Mr Hill is seen in footage with his left arm in a sling and a bandage around his head. The Russian state channel reported: ‘Andrew Hill laid down his arms and surrendered to the Russian military in the Mykolaiv region, after the group of mercenaries in which he fought was defeated and he himself was injured.’ In the footage, Mr Hill is asked: ‘What would you like to say to other Englishmen who decide to go to Ukraine?” He replied: ‘They need to really think about it, This doesn’t involve us.” He was then asked: ‘Where are you from? What city? The Brit replied: ‘Plymouth.’ Mr Hill said he was in a group of seven when he was captured. He added Russian soldiers had carried out first aid on his injuries. He crossed into Ukraine from Shezhuv in Poland. Asking when he might be released, he was told ‘I can’t tell you anything about that, but you can rest assured you’re safe.’ In other exchanges, he was asked: ‘Do you have a wife?’ Mr Hill explained he has an ex-wife, as well as four children and a partner he is dating. A Russian then said: ‘Your parents, do they know that you are here?’ Mr Hill replied: ‘My dad’s dead, my dad died on new year’s eve this year.’ He added he doesn’t have a close relationship with his mother. The footage was released by the Russia’s defence ministry today. ‘I don’t have a rank… I just know the foreign legion said I could help,’ Mr Hill added in the video. He was reportedly captured in the Mykolaiv region of southwestern Ukraine. It comes after another Scott Sibley was killed in Ukraine and two of his fellow Brits, Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin, were captured by Russian forces.
