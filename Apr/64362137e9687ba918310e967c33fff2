It’s officially the time of year where it’s impossible to dress for the weather. Whether it’s leaving the house dressed for a heatwave and coming home drenched after a short but mighty thunderstorm or being forced to carry your puffer jacket after misjudging the temperature, the transition from winter to spring always throws wardrobes out of whack. But, despite their inconvenience, transitional periods are exciting. While it would be very optimistic to ditch waterproofs altogether, spring is the perfect time to bring out that borg jacket that would never withstand the winter – and not to mention it’s the perfect time to add a pop of colour to your wardrobe. If you’re overwhelmed by all the choices, do not worry – we’ve put together a list of our favourite light jackets that are perfect for when the weather just won’t make up its mind.
