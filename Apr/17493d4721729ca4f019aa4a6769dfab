Wayne Rooney believes Manchester United should appoint Mauricio Pochettino ahead of Erik ten Hag. United have already begun preparations to replace Ralf Rangnick at the end of the season and Pochettino and Ten Hag are the two frontrunners for the role. Reports have claimed that Ten Hag has impressed United’s hierarchy during their discussions and the Ajax head coach is regarded as the favoured candidate at this stage. Pochettino, meanwhile, will have a year remaining on his contract with Paris Saint-Germain but is under huge pressure to keep his job following the team’s elimination from the Champions League last month. When asked about United’s managerial situation, Rooney has backed his former club to bring Pochettino to Old Trafford ahead of Ten Hag. ‘I think Pochettino has done it in the Premier League, he knows the Premier League. At Tottenham, he brought a lot of young players through, at Southampton as well,’ Rooney told Sky Sports. ‘If I’m choosing from one of the two, that’s who I’d choose. I’d go with Pochettino and give him time. ‘I think for managers no, they need time to come in and put their blueprint on the club and the team. If you give him time, I think he’ll do well. ‘For Manchester United not to be challenging, I think they’d want the season to stop now if it could and forget about the Champions League. ‘They’re not going to compete next year in the Champions League if they qualify for it. ‘They have to rebuild the squad and rebuild everything around the first team, round the club, to make sure they put themselves in the position to in two or three years’ time be ready to challenge again for the Premier League.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
