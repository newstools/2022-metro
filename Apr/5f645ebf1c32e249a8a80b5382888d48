Lottery players are being urged to check their tickets in case they’ve become a multi-millionaire without even knowing it. One mystery Lotto winner scooped the £5.3 million jackpot on April 13 – but still no one has come forward to claim it. The winner bought their ticket online for the £5,355,727 prize on April 13. The winning Lotto numbers on this day were 01, 07, 10, 30, 40, 53, while the bonus ball was 02. Camelot’s Andy Carter, Senior Winners’ Advisor at The National Lottery, has said it could be ‘a sensational start to the summer for the lucky multi-millionaire who has maybe yet to realise it!’ ‘Imagine what you could do with just over £5,000,000 – a once-in-a-lifetime holiday, a dream pad or treating your nearest and dearest, and a lot else besides’, he added. Another lucky winner won £1 million in the same draw for matching five numbers plus the bonus ball. They have already come forward to claim their money. People have been advised to log into their National Lottery account or look via the National Lottery app to check if they are the owner of the fortune. There are 180 days from the day of the draw to claim the money. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
