A 90-year-old woman welled up with emotion after finally finding her late husband’s wedding ring – 35 years after he lost it. Ann Kenrick says Peter, who passed away 22 years ago, lost his band while working in their back garden in Looe, Cornwall, in 1987. The mother-of-seven discovered the ring on Saturday when she was clearing around the base of an apple tree. She said she was ‘very excited’ to find it and said her husband would have been ‘as surprised as her’. Ann told the BBC: ‘It didn’t look at all like a wedding ring – it looked like a dirty piece of bent metal. ‘I looked at it and thought “no, it couldn’t be”. I was really quite excited. When I was telling a friend about it I got a bit choked up.’ Ann’s son, Bob Kenrick, 57, runs a restaurant near his home in Dartmouth, Devon. He said: ‘Mum was very emotional and over the moon. It wasn’t the first thing that went missing – he used to lose all sorts of things.’ Ann said she will get the ring repaired and wear it as a necklace in memory of her late husband.
