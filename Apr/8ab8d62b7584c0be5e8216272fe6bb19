People across the UK have woken up to frost, with the chilly weather set to continue over the weekend. April has got off to a cold start with temperatures dropping to -8C in Tulloch Bridge, Scotland on Friday night. The country has faced single-figure temperatures in recent days, with some regions even seeing snowfall, following a week which saw the warmest day of the year so far. The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for ice as temperatures were predicted to plummet this weekend. It has warned of ‘some injuries from slips and falls’ and ‘possible travel disruption’ on Saturday morning in the east of the country, including the Scottish Borders, North Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Queues have been forming at Dover as ferries face disruption due to the weather conditions overnight. Cross-Channel trips from the port to Calais and Dunkirk were postponed, causing further chaos following the suspension of P&O Ferries services. The cold conditions are due to an Arctic air crossing the UK, with the temperatures 7C lower than average for the time of year. The weekend will be ‘generally dry and cold’ but there will be clear and sunny skies, especially in the west of the country, the Met Office has said ‘We’ve got an Arctic air flow established at the moment, that’s coming from a cold source,’ meteorologist Dan Stroud said. ‘There’s also a lot of clear and sunny skies, especially to the western parts of the UK.’ Temperatures should climb back up to 14C on Monday, four degrees higher than average.
