Russia has warned it will bolster nuclear defences in the Baltic if Finland and Sweden join NATO. Sweden is said to be poised to join the military alliance as early as the summer, while Finland could follow suit soon after. But both countries risk Vladimir Putin’s wrath after the Kremlin cautioned expansion of NATO will ‘not bring stability’ to Europe amid the Ukraine war. Speaking on Thursday, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, said Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea. There could be ‘no more talk of a nuclear free Baltic, as the balance must be restored’, the former Russian president said. He said: ‘Until today, Russia has not taken such measures and was not going to. ‘If our hand is forced, well… take note it wasn’t us who proposed this’. Lithuanian officials have brushed aside his threats, describing them as ‘nothing new’. Moscow deployed nuclear weapons to Kaliningrad long before the crisis in Ukraine, they said. It comes amid reports Putin is moving military equipment towards Russia’s border with Finland. Finland gained independence from Russia in 1917 and fought two wars against it during World War Two, losing some territory in the process. A decision on applying for NATO membership will be made in the next few weeks, Prime Minister Sanna Marin confirmed on Wednesday. Her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, has said there is ‘no point delaying’ the decision. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years, maintaining a ‘policy of neutrality’ during World War II. The nation’s post-war foreign policy has focused on supporting democracy internationally, multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament. One reason behind Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was the government’s desire to join NATO – although it is highly unlikely to be accepted any time soon.
