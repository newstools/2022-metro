Coronation Street’s Simon Gregson was asked to leave a club after stripping off his shirt and dancing topless on the tables at a co-star’s leaving do, reports have claimed. The Steve McDonald star had been partying it up at Alexandra Mardell’s farewell bash in Manchester when bouncers allegedly kicked him out of the venue. ‘He was the life and soul of the party but took it a bit far and it annoyed the bar staff and bouncers in the end,’ a witness told The Sun. ‘Simon was acting pretty wildly — but more in the sense that he was in high spirits and getting carried away,’ another added to the publication. ‘He had obviously had a good night and was out with a lot of the Corrie cast and crew. ‘But towards the end of the night Simon obviously thought it was a good idea to jump up for a topless dance. He was on a piece of furniture using it as a type of makeshift stage.’ Eventually, Simon was coached down and made to put his clothes back on. It was reported that he was then asked to leave the bar. Other cast members in attendance included Kelly Neelan star Millie Gibson, Colson Smith (who plays Craig Tinker), Georgia Taylor (Toyah Battersby), Elle Mulvaney (Amy Barlow) and Mollie Gallagher (Nina Lucas). It was previously revealed that Alexandra would be bowing out of the Cobbles as Emma. ‘I’m so pleased, I’m really pleased,’ she said of her character not being killed off. ‘Even saying goodbye now was hard enough, but that little bit of hope that one day there’s a possibility I could go back, that keeps you going – it’s not goodbye forever, you never know. ‘I’m really glad that she wasn’t killed off. Emma’s just having a really good holiday!’ Metro.co.uk has contacted Simon’s rep for comment.
