A musician has admitted murdering an 18-year-old student who disappeared from a bus stop yards from her home in Plymouth. Bobbi-Anne McLeod’s devastated family sobbed as Cody Ackland, 24, pleaded guilty at the city’s crown court, saving them from a traumatic trial. Her disappearance sparked a desperate search in Plymouth’s Leigham suburb, led by her heartbroken boyfriend Louie Leach, 17, and mother Donna McLeod. But when her mobile phone and headphones were discovered, it dawned on them that something awful had happened. The petite student’s body was then found dumped in woods near the beach at Bovisand on November 23, following a tip-off to Devon and Cornwall Police. Despite extensive work by the coroner, Bobbi-Anne’s cause of death is still not known. Ackland’s guilty plea to the single count of murder confirms her family’s worst fears – that she was deliberately killed by a stranger. Appearing in court today, he spoke only to confirm his name, age and admit murdering the teenager between November 19 and 23 last year. Ackland, from Southway, Plymouth, will be sentenced on May 19. He remains in custody. No further details about Miss McLeod’s murder were mentioned in court today. This is a breaking news story, more to follow soon… Check back shortly for further updates.
