A father has been charged with the murder of his two-week-old baby. Darin Harvey, 25, will appear in court today accused of killing little Felicity-May. She was rushed to hospital by the emergency services after they were called to a property in Heywood, Greater Manchester, on January 8 last year. Doctors tried their best to save the tiny baby but she died three days later in hospital on January 11. In a heartbreaking tribute, Felicity-May’s family said her cleft lip and palate ‘made her extra special’ and she was the happiest little girl despite the challenges of her condition. ‘Our hearts are broken after losing our precious baby girl, Felicity-May,’ they wrote. ‘She was a gorgeous baby and always so alert, looking around with her big blue eyes. ‘She was absolutely beautiful and incredibly brave, and she melted the hearts of everyone who met her. ‘What made her extra special was her cleft lip and palate and, despite the challenges of this, she was the most happy and content little girl. ‘She was and always will be loved by her mum, sisters and family and there is a huge void in all our hearts and lives now that she has been taken from us. ‘She was our special star, and it is not fair that she shone brightly for only a short time. ‘When we look up at the sky, we will look through the clouds and know that the brightest star shining is our Felicity-May.’ A police spokesperson said: ‘The father of a two-week old baby girl who died in Heywood last year has been charged with her murder. ‘Darin Harvey, 25, of Birch Road, Wardle, has been remanded in custody and will appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates’ Court later today. ‘He will stand accused of the murder of his daughter Felicity-May Harvey who sadly passed away in hospital on Monday 11 January 2021 after we were called to a report of concern for her welfare.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
