An ‘unusually high’ number of conscripts have been signed by Vladimir Putin igniting fears thousands more Russian troops could be sent to Ukraine. The Russian president is said to have signed some 134,500 new conscripts into the country’s army last week as part of the biannual draft. A Western official said there is a ‘realistic’ possibility the conscripts will be sent into Ukraine, alongside forces currently in Georgia. ‘The timing aligns with previous Spring drafts but we think that it’s an unusually high number,’ they said. ‘We do think there’s a realistic possibility these conscripts will be sent into Ukraine, even though the Russian Ministry of Defence have said only professional soldiers will go to Ukraine.’ The official continued: ‘Russia is redeploying elements of the forces that are in Georgia to reinforce the invasion of Ukraine.’ The move was seemingly unplanned and indicative of the problems troops are facing in Ukraine, they added. Russia’s conscription began on Friday and will end on July 15, during which men between 18 and 27 will be rounded up for a one-year tour of military duty. Officials have said new recruits will not be sent to ‘hot spots’ or the frontlines. The defence ministry previously acknowledged some had been sent to Ukraine but added the officials’ responsible would be punished. After nearly six weeks of war, Nato estimates up to 15,000 Russian soldiers may have been killed in the fighting. Ukraine claims this number is now close to 20,000.
