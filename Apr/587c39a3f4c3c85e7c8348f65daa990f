Jurgen Klopp says his Liverpool squad have a completely clean bill of health ahead of their trip to Benfica in the first round of the Champions League quarter-finals on Tuesday night. There had been some doubts over the likes of Curtis Jones, Noel Matip and Trent Alexander-Arnold, while Naby Keita was also not 100 per cent fit, missing out against Watford at the weekend. Klopp has confirmed that all of them will be available to him on Tuesday in Portugal, saying that the minor injuries have subsided in time for the European tie. ‘Yes full squad available, absolutely,’ Klopp told a press conference on Monday. ‘Curtis was a little swelling, it appeared over night, fine. Same as Joel, which was very helpful because it looked really strange. ‘Trent now four or five days [in training], not sure exactly, but he’s ready as well.’ Matip and Jones both started in the 2-0 win over Watford at the weekend, while Alexander-Arnold was left on the bench. It was simply a precaution that the England international was rested, though, and he is expected to be in the starting line-up again when the Reds face Benfica. Klopp has a wealth of options available to him, after starting Mohamed Salah, Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino in the front three against the Hornets, with Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz on the bench. Both Mane and Diaz will be hoping to be back in the starting XI against Benfica, but competition for places is fierce at the moment in Klopp’s side.
