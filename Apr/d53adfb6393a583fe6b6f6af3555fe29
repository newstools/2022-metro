Did you know there was such a thing as running myths? According to Christian Allen, Product Trainer at Runners Need, there are common misconceptions about running and the body, which can put people off taking up the sport. With this in mind, we’ve asked Christian to dispel three of the most common ones. ‘Many people think that you need to have a certain body type to run – usually lean – but this simply isn’t true,’ he says. ‘Runners come in all shapes and sizes: it’s a sport for everyone. While it may seem intimidating when you’re starting out, there is nothing to be afraid of and running is really inclusive. ‘There are lots of free weekly running clubs open to all abilities and body types and you’ll soon realise you don’t have to look a certain way to enjoy it.’ ‘It’s a huge myth that running is bad for your knees,’ he says. ‘In fact, studies show that regular running can help keep your joints lubricated and stimulates your body to build new cartilage. ‘Many runners also incorporate strength exercises into their training plans to help keep their joints and muscles strong, which can also help to protect our knees. ‘However, it is important to keep an eye on your technique, as while running won’t ruin your knees, running with bad form can.’ ‘Many people often think that your running style can’t change, but there are several factors that can impact your gait (the way your foot strikes the floor),’ he says. ‘This is why we encourage runners to have a gait analysis before they buy a new pair of trainers. ‘Factors that can have an impact on our running style and gait include an increase or decrease in fitness, weight loss or weight gain as well as pregnancy.’ Do you have a story to share?
