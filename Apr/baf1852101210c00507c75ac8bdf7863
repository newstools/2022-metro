Thomas Tuchel has announced that Antonio Rudiger will leave Chelsea at the end of the season. The Germany international’s current contract with Chelsea is due to expire this summer and the defender has failed to reach an agreement with the club. The 29-year-old’s representative has already held talks with Real Madrid, Barcelona and Manchester United ahead of a summer move. And Tuchel revealed after Chelsea’s 1-0 win over West Ham on Sunday that Rudiger has decided to call an end to his time at Stamford Bridge. ‘Toni… the media is on it. The situation seems to be that he leaves the club,’ Tuchel said. ‘He informed some days ago in a personal talk. ‘We gave everything, me and the club, but we could not fight anymore because of the sanctions. ‘[Without the sanctions] we would at least have had the chance to keep on fighting, so since many weeks our hands are tied. I don’t know what would’ve been the outcome. We don’t take it personally. ‘Character-wise and personally he is a key figure and he will stay that way until the end of the season. But it is very disappointing, of course. Asked how much he will miss him, Tuchel replied: ‘A lot. ‘He’s a huge influence in the dressing room. He’s the guy who gives other people courage. ‘He’s the guy everyone is a bit afraid of, he’s that kind of player, but also, let’s focus on the sport, the kind to play 50-55 games, 90 minutes, at an outstanding level. ‘He was the top defender in the last one and a half years for me. I have nothing but respect for what he did. ‘He needs to keep going until the end then we then need to find another solution.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
