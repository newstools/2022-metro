Vin Diesel has announced that Captain Marvel star Brie Larson is the newest member of the Fast and Furious ‘family’ as she gets set to join him in the franchise’s 10th instalment. The actor, who has helmed the series as street racer Dominic Toretto since the first film in 2001, took to Instagram on Saturday night to make introductions and share the news. Posting a laughing picture of himself with the Oscar winner, who rests her hands on his shoulder, he wrote: ‘Yeah yeah yeah… you see this angel over my shoulder cracking me up, you say to your self [sic], “that’s Captain Marvel”. Clearly there is love and laughter in this image. ‘What you don’t see however, is the character you will be introduced to in Fast10.’ Praising her talents, he added: ‘You have no idea how timeless and amazing she will be in our mythology. Beyond her beauty, her intellect… her Oscar, haha is this profound soul who will add something you might not have expected but yearned for.’ ‘Welcome to the FAMILY Brie,’ he finished. Although the 32-year-old actress, who added another string to her bow by launching a YouTube channel during the pandemic, has yet to comment publicly on Diesel’s post, fans were very excited by the news. ‘Yes yes welcome to the Fast Family we are so honoured to have you join our family and franchise!!! ❤️❤️,’ commented one, while another gushed: ‘NO WAAAAYYYY 😍😍😍😍😍’ Rapper, actor and Fast and Furious family member Ludacris was also excited by the announcement, leaving two star emoji. Larson is set to join another Fast newcomer in Aquaman star Jason Momoa, who was reported to be in ‘final negotiations’ for a main role in January. His involvement has since been confirmed, with the actor revealing that he will be the villain of the piece. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, he revealed: ‘It’s fun, I get to play the bad guy, which I haven’t gotten to do for a while. Now, I get to be the bad boy. A very flamboyant bad boy. A little panache!’ Justin Lin, who helmed F9 for his third time in the director’s chair for the franchise, will be back for the 10th film, and will produce alongside series stalwart Diesel. Other returners for the upcoming movie include Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris – real name Chris Bridges – and Sung Kang, while Charlize Theron, who was a popular addition in the eighth film, The Fate of the Furious, as well as F9, is also expected to be back. One star who will not be returning is Dwayne Johnson, who slammed Diesel’s public courting of him via social media in at the end of 2021, as the actor and producer attempted to win him over. The pair have had ongoing tension since 2016, stemming from an infamous falling out while filming The Fate of the Furious, and former WWE wrestler Johnson branded Diesel’s plea for him to return ‘manipulative’ and said there was ‘no chance’. Metro.co.uk has contacted Larson’s reps and Universal for comment. Got a story?
