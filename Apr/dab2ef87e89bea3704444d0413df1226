The 64th Annual Grammy Awards takes place tomorrow night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The biggest stars of the music world will gather together to recognise the best recordings, compositions, and artists of the past year. Outside of the music, it’s always a fashion extravaganza, with pop stars often making some wild and wonderful choices. It’s a perfect event for A-listers to express themselves, and it provides brilliant viewing for those of us scrolling social media at home. Over the years, we really have been spoilt with showstopping style moments at the Grammys. From Jennifer Lopez in ‘that’ Versace dress in 2000 to Cardi B in vintage Mugler in 2019, there have been serious fashion feasts. And to get us excited for tomorrow night’s red carpet proceedings, we’ve put together a list of 23 of the most iconic Grammy outfits of all time. Let’s hope 2022’s class follows in their sartorial footsteps. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
