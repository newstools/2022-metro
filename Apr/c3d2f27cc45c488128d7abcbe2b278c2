Kathryn Hays, best known for her role as Kim Sullivan Hughes in As The World Turns, has reportedly died at the age of 88. The actress died on March 25 in Fairfield, Connecticut. A cause of death has not been confirmed. Her death was announced in the Connecticut Post, according to Deadline. Hays starred in the iconic American soap for 38 years, and also made a guest appearance on Star Trek in 1968, playing the titular mute hero, Gem, in The Empath. Her As The World Turns co-star, Don Hastings, who played her on-screen husband Bob Hughes, has shared a heartfelt tribute. He said (via TV Line): ‘Our relationship as Bob and Kim was as close as Kathryn and my relationship, except we were not married. ‘We were more like brother and sister and we were great friends. Our biggest squabble was that she always wanted to rehearse and I wanted to take a nap. This is a huge loss to all who knew her.’ Hays began her career in the 1960s with roles in series such as Hawaiian Eye, Surfside 6, Naked City and Route 66. She joined the cast of As The World Turns in 1972 and starred in countless storylines over the next four decades. The actress left the show in 2010. She is survived by her daughter and son-in-law Sherri and Bob Mancusi, three grandchildren, and a great grandson. Tributes have come in for the late star, with one fan writing: ‘This one really hurts. Kathryn Hays was such a beacon of light and talent on ATWT. And losing her feels like we’ve all lost a powerful and poised aunt. Rest In Peace, Ms Hays.’ Another said: ‘RIP Kathryn Hays. Loved her for so many years as Kim Hughes on As The World Turns.’ One more added: ‘Thank you for your talent on my favorite soap opera. May God grant you peace & your family comfort. #KathrynHays.’ MORE : Romeo Beckham cuddles up with girlfriend Mia Regan on a yacht ahead of Brooklyn’s lavish Miami wedding MORE : Will Smith banned from Oscars and Academy events for 10 years after ‘unacceptable and harmful’ Chris Rock slap
