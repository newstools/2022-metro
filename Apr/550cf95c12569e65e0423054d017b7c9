An east London pub has been forced to shut its door and pay a fine of more than £1,300 after a cockroach infestation was discovered. The Leytonstone boozer was shut following a food hygiene inspection when officials were horrified to find a ‘serious cockroach infestation’. The Plough and Harrow was slammed for its lack of basic cleanliness and poor hygiene standards during the routine visit. It was considered an ‘imminent risk’ to customers’ health, and forced to pay Waltham Forest Council £1,328. The local authority says inspectors found the insects in several areas of the pub. The damages were awarded during a hearing at Thames Magistrates Court last week. As a result, Foggy Lake Ltd and Star of India restaurateur Shah Ahmed cannot operate a food service out of the premises until the ‘imminent risk’ to the public is removed. A Waltham Forest Council spokesperson said: ‘This case underscores the importance of good food hygiene standards and the hard work of our team in protecting our residents from risks to health and safety. ‘While the council continues to do everything within its means to remove these risks, we urge customers to check food hygiene ratings before eating out or ordering a takeaway.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
