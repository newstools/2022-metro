Ralf Rangnick has suggested removing the Manchester United captaincy from Harry Maguire and allowing the squad to pick their skipper. Maguire was made United captain by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer just five months after he made the move to Old Trafford in a £80 million deal from Leicester City. The England international has faced a lot of criticism for his performances this season and he could now miss the rest of the campaign due to a knee injury. Erik ten Hag will be replacing Rangnick as manager this summer and the German believes United’s dressing room should decide their own leader. When asked if Maguire should remain captain under Ten Hag, Rangnick replied: ‘Again, I understand your question, but again I think it doesn’t make sense because you don’t know which kind of players will be here, what the group will look like. ‘I can only tell what I have done in the past when I was the head coach or the manager, because in Germany it’s called ‘match kapitan’, so the captain of the team. ‘I strongly believe that the captain should be elected by the team because he’s called the team manager, and we always did that. ‘We always had a board of four or five players, we called it the ‘spielkapitan’, elected by the players, the player with the highest amount of votes was the team captain at the end. ‘That’s how I did it, I know that not a lot of head coaches do it that way.’ When it was pointed out to him that Pep Guardiola adopts a similar approach at Manchester City, Rangnick added: ‘Yeah, so that’s what I would do if I was still the manager next season, but I’m not, so that is something for Erik to decide.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
