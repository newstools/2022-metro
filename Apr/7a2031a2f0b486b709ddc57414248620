Fulham have been promoted back to the Premier League at the first time of asking following their 3-0 win over Preston North End on Tuesday night. First-half goals from Aleksandar Mitrovic and Fabio Carvalho secured the Cottagers return to the top-flight in front of a jubilant Craven Cottage crowd. Fulham’s promotion has been a long time coming, as Marco Silva’s side have been top of the Championship table since November, with their campaign spearheaded by striker Mitrovic who has smashed the division’s goal scoring record, with 40 goals in 40 games at the time of writing. Fulham defender and vice-captain Tim Ream told BBC Radio 5 Live after the match: ‘To do it at home in front of our fans, the way we did it storming that first half – there are not many better feelings. ‘It’s been a breath of fresh air to be honest when Marco Silva came in, absolutely incredible. ‘He’s come in and brought his own philosophy of attacking football and you look at the amount we score, he’s just an all-around very good manager and someone we needed at the club at that time.’ The West Londoners will be hoping that their next stay in the Premier League will be longer than their last one in 2020/21, when they were relegated after a single season. Fulham are likely to be joined by Bournemouth, who last played in the top-flight in 2020, while the third promotion spot is very much up for grabs with Huddersfield Town, Luton Town, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United currently occupying the play-off places.
