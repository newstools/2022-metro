The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee is fast-approaching and various brands are getting in on the action. Morrisons has already unveiled a novelty Corgi cake, named Clarence, and M&S has brought out new drinks for the occasion. But now it seems Heinz is getting involved, too. Two of the nation’s favourite condiments have received a royal makeover for the celebration. Heinz Salad Cream and HP have been renamed ‘HM Sauce’ and ‘Heinz Salad Queen.’ The new limited edition sauces will appear on supermarket shelves this week – ready for the four-day bank holiday weekend in June. Heinz decided to shake things up with their sauces after an Opinium Research poll, of 2,000 Britons, found that half said the Jubilee is an opportunity to consume quintessentially British foods – such as afternoon tea, strawberries and cream, and fish and chips. Anke von Hanstein, a senior brand manager at Heinz, said: ‘This is an extraordinary moment for the Queen and the great British public, and we want to celebrate this with two of our most well-loved and historic sauces. ‘Releasing limited-edition bottles in time for the Jubilee felt like the perfect fit. ‘HP sauce and Heinz Salad Cream have been on the dining tables of Brits throughout all the Queen’s reign, bringing delicious and distinctive flavours to our favourite meals.’ So whether you’re having a BBQ or a picnic to mark the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, these themed goodies could make a welcome addition to your feasting set-up.
