Aldi has a number of offers in the middle aisle every week – called Specialbuys. From egg chairs to bedding, and fire pits to gin, there are always some great deals to be found. If you’re planning ahead to visit the iconic middle aisle – or you prefer to get your bargains online – we’ve got you covered. Here are our top picks of this week’s Aldi Specialbuys. This week, Aldi has everything you need to enjoy your Easter bank holiday, from equipment for hobbies to furniture for your garden. When you think of rocking chairs, you probably think of big old wicker numbers – but there are plenty of modern options out there. This set costs £169.99, and comes with two chairs, a table, and cushions to make your al fresco rock sessions more relaxing. Available on the Aldi website now. Pressure washers are great for sprucing up your home and garden, but can be heavy to carry and difficult to work with. That’s where this handy tool comes with a stand and wheels to make light work of cleaning – and it packs a powerful punch with a high-pressure hose. Available for £199.99 on the Aldi website now. These boots are a steal at £44.99 each, and perfect for horse riders and dog walkers alike. Made with high quality nubuck and suede leather, and with a padded insock, they’ll see you through the seasons. Available on the Aldi website and in stores now.
