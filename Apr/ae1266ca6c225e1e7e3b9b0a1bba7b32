A student suddenly collapsed and died during a performance based on the story of the crucifixion. Suel Ambrose, 25, was studying philosophy at Clariantian University, in Nekede, Nigeria, in the hope of one day becoming a priest. He was playing the disciple Peter in the university’s biblical play over the Easter weekend. But Suel collapsed during the scene where Peter cuts off a soldier’s ear to try and save Jesus. Many thought the collapse was ‘a joke or part of the drama’ but ‘knew it was serious when he could not get up’, a witness told Vanguard. Suel was taken to hospital but he could not be saved. It is not yet known what caused his death. Metro.co.uk has contacted Clariantian University for comment. Easter celebrations took place across the world over the weekend, including El Salvador’s tradition of ‘devils’ whipping locals in the street. The event aims to highlight the universal struggle of good versus evil, and takes place in the town of Texistepeque, near the capital San Salvador. Actors play characters called Talciguines, meaning ‘demon man’, dress in red robes and punish people for their sins. They act out scenes with another actor playing Jesus, showing some of the times Christ was tempted to sin but resisted. Many people travel from all over the country to watch the ceremony and volunteer to be whipped as repentance for their sins. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
