It’s not a common sight to find 500 pounds of marijuana strewn across a highway. But the day that it went down, happened to be 4/20. ‘You don’t see this everyday, but it is 4/20…’ the Missouri State Highway Patrol tweeted in reference 420, the annual day celebrating cannabis. An accompanying photo shared by the patrol showed dozens of white sacks across a highway. ‘Troopers responded to a crash today on I-70 in Callaway County and found 500 pounds of packaged marijuana scattered around,’ the highway patrol wrote. ‘Luckily, nobody was seriously injured.’ In another tweet, the highway patrol said that all the sacks were collected at the crash scene and ‘it took more than one patrol car to transport it to the evidence room’. Another image showed plastic bags apparently containing marijuana piled up like a pyramid. The accident involved a pickup truck with two men, including the driver, and a woman who were transporting the massive amount of pot. No one was seriously injured in the incident. The highway patrol believes that a semitrailer driver was trying to avoid a previous crash, and that a pickup truck driver at that moment lost control and hit the rear of the semitrailer. Another semitrailer flew off the road and then struck the pickup truck, the TV station reported. Two men from Mexico, aged 34 and 32, were arrested and charged with first-degree drug trafficking, a felony, according to the highway patrol. In addition, one of the suspects was charged with reckless driving. The 32-year-old suspect is named Victor Gonzalez Acosta. If convicted, they could face 10 to 13 years in prison, as well as fines. In Missouri, pot is legal for medicinal uses only. Medical marijuana dispensaries generated $30million in state tax revenue in 2020, the Kansas City Beacon reported in January.
