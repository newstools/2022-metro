Sergio Ramos was booed and jeered by Paris Saint-Germain supporters at the Parc des Princes in his first game back following his injury. The 36-year-old left Real Madrid after 16 years last June and signed a two-year contract with the French club. But Ramos has struggled with injuries during his time at PSG and has made just five appearances in all competitions this season. Following their Champions League exit last month, PSG fans took out their frustrations on Neymar and Lionel Messi as they booed the pair in the first game after their defeat to Real Madrid. And it’s clear that PSG are also unhappy with Ramos judging by the reception he received in their 5-1 win over Lorient on Sunday evening. The Spain international was brought on as a substitute for Marquinhos with 18 minutes remaining, but as he ran onto the pitch the defender was loudly booed by PSG’s supporters. After the game restarted following the substitution, Ramos was also jeered by the PSG fans every time he touched the ball. Ramos has been sidelined since January 23 due to a calf problem. Two goals apiece from Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, as well as a strike from Lionel Messi, sealed PSG’s 5-1 win over Lorient. Mauricio Pochettino’s side are now 12 points clear at the top of Ligue 1 and on course to win the title. For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
