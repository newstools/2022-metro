Countryfile presenter Helen Skelton has announced she has split from husband Richie Myler. The TV star shared the heartbreaking news in an Instagram post on Monday night. It comes just four months after Helen, 38, welcomed her third child, daughter Elsie Kate, with Richie, 31. They are also parents to son Ernie, six, and Louis, four. In her short statement, Helen told her followers: ‘Very sad to say that Richie and I are no longer a couple. He has left the family home. We will be doing our best to co parent our small children,’ alongside two heartbroken emoji. Helen had earlier shared a poignant meme about motherhood alluding to her personal issues, which read: ‘A mama is always full of emotions, full of love, full of anxiety and worries, full of exhaustion and lack of energy, full of mum guilt and doubt, full of pride in her kids, full of pure joy. ‘She feels it all, that’s the beauty of her, she carries it all too, and yet she gets up every day and does it all over again.’ Helen last shared an Instagram post with Richie on February 13, with the married couple posing for a selfie and looking happy. In honour of Valentine’s Day the following day, she wrote: ‘That time I bumped Into you in the kitchen for ten minutes. ❤️ 🤪 #familyoffive #thejuggleisreal #weekends #thesearethedays #thesearethedays #grateful #valentines #mylove.’ Richie, a rugby star who plays for Leeds Rhinos, has not spoken out about the separation. The pair welcomed their daughter just in time for the new year, announcing Elsie’s arrival on December 31. Alongside a photo of Richie carrying the newborn out of the hospital, Helen said: ‘Can always count on dickie …. of all the things he’s said (there’s been a lot) “don’t worry I will be your lido…” while on route to hospital might be my fave. The man meant Doula. From the mouths of men. ‘But mainly because I am still failing to find appropriate words of thanks for our @nhsengland @nhsmillion …. legends the blooming lot of them). #grateful #thanks #pregnancy #birth #newparents #newbaby #husbands #doula.’ Helen and Richie had been married for eight years, after tying the knot in December 2013.
