Live the French dream in beautiful rustic village home for just £25,000 – but you’ll have to put a lot of work in. If you’re fed up of the British climate and fancy giving it all up to live in the South of France, this rustic property could be perfect. The two-bed house offers lots of space and is situated in the charming village of Coussac Bonneval – but best of all, the price for the home is just €30,000 (£25,000). But, of course, there is a catch. Although the property has already been modernised in some areas, it does need some further renovation – particularly on the roof. If you are up to the challenge, you’ll get a hallway, a living area, kitchen, two bedrooms, a bathroom, and an attic. On the ground floor, the large entrance hallway has an open fireplace with lots of storage space. The living area has a wood-burning stove – which is a perfect spot to relax and enjoy a glass of local wine. The kitchen has a gas hob and electric oven for cooking up all your favourite French produce. Upstairs, there are the two bedrooms and a family bathroom, with a pull-down wooden staircase to access the attic. Sadly, it doesn’t come with outside space, but you can explore the streets of Coussac Bonneval, where you’ll find a ‘fabulous’ chateau, bars, restaurants, a post office, a mini supermarket and butchers. According to the listing on Leggett, the home has ‘great potential’ and could be a perfect escape. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
