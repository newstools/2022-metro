Manchester United are set to bring Steve McClaren back to Old Trafford as part of Erik ten Hag’s backroom team, according to reports. On Thursday, United confirmed that the Ajax head coach will replace Ralf Rangnick as their new manager at the end of the season. Ten Hag wants to bring in Mitchell van der Gaag, who is his current assistant at Ajax, as his No.2 at Old Trafford. But the 52-year-old is also keen to have McClaren as part of his coaching set-up, having worked with him at FC Twente. McClaren also spent just over a year as Sir Alex Ferguson’s assistant at Manchester United during the club’s treble-winning season. According to The Telegraph, United had initially asked Ten Hag to consider an internal appointment instead of bringing back McClaren. But the report now claims that Ten Hag has been granted his request and McClaren is in line to return to Old Trafford for a second spell. ‘It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead,’ said Ten Hag after confirmation of his move.‘I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve. ‘It will be difficult to leave Ajax after these incredible years, and I can assure our fans of my complete commitment and focus on bringing this season to a successful conclusion before I move to Manchester United.’ Former United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, now Ajax’s CEO, said: ‘Four and a half years is a good amount of time, but we would have liked to have kept Erik at Ajax for longer. ‘He is going to make the step to one of the biggest clubs in the world, in a fantastic league.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
