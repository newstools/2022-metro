A stalker who terrorised his ex-girlfriend is behind bars again after refusing to learn his lesson. John Pennington, 39, attached a device to Kayleigh Brodie’s car, slashed her tyres and threatened to kill her when she went to report the terrifying incidents to police. The mum-of-three said the traumatic ordeal had destroyed her life as her former partner refused to accept their relationship was over. Pennington served time in prison for his horrendous crimes in 2019 – but was hunted by police last year in connection with stalking, harassment and criminal damage allegations. The public was warned not to approach him before he was arrested on claims he had stalked a different woman. The defendant breached a non-molestation order by contacting one of his victims while on bail. But he is now off the streets once again after a judge at Preston Crown Court jailed him for two years last week. Liverpool Crown Court previously heard in July 2019 his harassment of Ms Brodie continued for months. The tracking device on her vehicle meant he could follow her, even sending her a message after she visited a kebab shop saying: ‘Ha ha, what’s for tea?’ Describing one incident to the court, Neil Bisarya, prosecuting, said: ‘The tracking device was linked to the defendant’s mobile phone. ‘On one occasion, he slashed two tyres on her car, and she tried to drive off with two deflated tyres. ‘He grabbed her car keys through the car window and ran off. She was assisted by a taxi driver.’ Other occasions saw him speed past her aggressively on the M62 as she was heading to a police station and threaten to kill her.
