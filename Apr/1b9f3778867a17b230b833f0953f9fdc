A fleet of trains on the Metropolitan line has been brought to a halt as urgent safety checks are carried out. A fault has been discovered on some of the wheels of a number of trains during routine inspections. Londoners heading back to work on Monday have been warned of severe disruptions – with a special timetable running until further notice. The trains – introduced in 2010 – also run on the Circle and Hammersmith & City lines. No disruptions to those services have been reported. Engineers are boosting the frequency of their inspections as a result of the findings today. A statement from Transport for London said: ‘Safety is our top priority, and as a precautionary measure we have increased the rate of inspection of these trains to make detailed checks of the entire fleet.’ Passengers are being advised to check their routes before they travel. Trains are operating between Baker Street and Amersham, and Chesham and Baker Street, every 30 minutes. They are also going between Watford and Baker Street, and Uxbridge and Aldgate, every 15 minutes. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
