What says love better than hearts, flowers, or diamonds? A nice fried egg, according to this jewellery brand. No, we’re not talking about the understated romance of breakfast in bed (although that is rather lovely). Instead, we are of course discussing this Easter themed engagement ring… designed to look like an egg. The jewellers at Steven Stone, who dropped this eye-catching design just in time for Easter, cite the filling of Creme Eggs as their inspiration. The ring been designed with 0.3ct a yellow diamond laying on a bed of white enamel. It’s also got 18ct gold and diamond set pave detail, and the band can be your choice of yellow, white or rose gold or platinum. And that’s not all – there are also egg earrings and a necklace for sale as part of a whole coll-egg-tion. They feature the same yellow diamond/white enamel combo to form the egg, and the same diamond/gold border. The necklaces are going for £8,000 and the earrings for an eye-watering £30,000. Jewellery designer Maxwell Stone said: ‘Easter is a time of indulgence. And, while many of us will be tucking in to chocolate eggs, here at Steven Stone, we wanted to create a unique treat for those who prefer diamonds over dessert. ‘The Easter Egg collection is designed to be fun and eccentric. ‘Using fancy vivid yellow diamonds, white diamonds, and yellow gold, we wanted to get creative, in a bid to showcase a head-turning collection that gets everyone talking.’ These pieces are handmade to order – if you’re interested, you can chat to a member of the Steven Stone team.
