A driver pulled over for driving well over the limit has blamed his speeding offence on love. The man on the M40 was stopped on Sunday morning for travelling at 102mph. Officers from Thames Valley Police’s road unit spoke to the man, and he apparently claimed ‘love made him do it’. They scoffed at his excuse for his behaviour over the Bank Holiday weekend, quoting a famous Meat Loaf hit. They tweeted: ‘Motorist stopped on the M40 doing 102mph en-route to see his girlfriend. Stated love made him. ‘Rock legend Meat Loaf “would do anything thing for love, but I just won’t do that!” (Speeding?)’ The traffic cops added on Facebook: ‘A small number of drivers were stopped for offences including: ‘Speeding: 102mph, 91, 90 and 89, 2 x careless driving (undertaking at speed), 1 x not in proper control of their vehicle.’ They said they reported the man and the other drivers to court. ‘Remember arrive alive and stick to the limits. It’s not worth the risk,’ they added. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
