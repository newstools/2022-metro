A man has been arrested after three women and another man were killed in a suspected stabbing at a residential address in south-east London. The victims were found with injuries consistent with knife wounds at around 1.40am on Monday at the home on Delaford Road, Bermondsey.

The suspect was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody in a south London police station. A spokesperson from the Metropolitan Police added: ‘Officers are in the process of contacting next of kin. ‘Post-mortem examinations will be arranged in due course.
