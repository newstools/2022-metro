A dramatic solar eclipse seen from the surface of Mars has been captured on video by Nasa’s Perseverance rover. The moment Phobos – one of the red planet’s two moons – passes in front of the sun was captured on April 2, the 397th day of the rover’s time on Mars. Captured with Perseverance’s high-tech Mastcam-Z camera, the eclipse lasted a little over 40 seconds. ‘I knew it was going to be good, but I didn’t expect it to be this amazing,’ said Rachel Howson from Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, one of the Mastcam-Z team members who operates the camera. Howson noted that although Perseverance first sends lower-resolution thumbnails that offer a glimpse of the images to come, she was stunned by the full-resolution versions. ‘It feels like a birthday or holiday when they arrive. You know what’s coming, but there is still an element of surprise when you get to see the final product.’ The images are the latest in a long history of Nasa spacecraft capturing solar eclipses on Mars. Back in 2004, the twin Nasa rovers Spirit and Opportunity took the first time-lapse photos of Phobos during a solar eclipse. Curiosity continued the trend with videos shot by its Mastcam camera system. Phobos is the larger of Mars’ two moons and it orbits the planet three times a day. It’s so close to the planet’s surface that, in some locations on Mars, it cannot always be seen. Perseverance has been on Mars since February 2021. It’s mission is to gather rock and soil samples using its drill, and it will store the sample cores in tubes on the Martian surface. Keeping them ready for a return mission to bring around 30 samples to Earth in the early 2030s.
