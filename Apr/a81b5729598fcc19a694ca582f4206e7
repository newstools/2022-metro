Julia Bradbury has worn a bikini for the first time since her mastectomy and she feels ‘incredibly grateful’ to be in the position she’s in. The TV presenter shared the news of her diagnosis last September, explaining that she would be undergoing a mastectomy to remove a six-centimetre tumour. Julia, 51, has been documenting her experience to raise awareness of breast cancer and how it can affect people’s lives. She previously spoke of the ‘brutal’ treatments for cancer, saying she felt ‘utterly bewildered’ prior to her op and a great sense of ‘relief’ once it was over. Now, the former Countryfile host is determined to rebuild her life and is doing thing she never thought would be possible. Julia shared a radiant snap of herself wearing a bikini for the first time post-surgery as she soaks up the sun Mauritius. She said she feels ‘fortunate’ to have had immediate breast reconstruction and to have had things go her ‘way’ after receiving the heartbreaking diagnosis. The picture shows Julia wearing a pink cover-up with a patterned blue and white bikini set, while she fixes her hair and sunbathes on a sun lounger. Getting candid, she captioned the post: ‘I had no idea what life after a #mastectomy would be like. I feel incredibly grateful that some things have gone my way during my #breastcancer diagnosis. ‘Each of our stories is different… I was fortunate to be able to have immediate recon after my breast was removed containing a 6cm tumour.’ She continued: ‘Nothing prepares you for the shock & impact…& yet but here I am in a bikini again. Didn’t think this would happen. Wearing wraps helps too. Of course it’s @melissaodabash! Thanks @gaylerinkoff for finding me new 👙’ Her followers were full of praise and love for the TV star in the comments, with many sharing their own personal cancer stories. ‘You are an inspiration Julia with your positive thoughts! Sending you lots of love and strength for your recovery! You look amazing by the way 😊❤️’, one wrote. Another commented: ‘This is so inspiring, I’m going in tonight for my mastectomy tomorrow. Thank you Xx’ Former Loose Women panellist Andrea McLean also wrote: ‘I hope you’re having a lovely time ❤️’ Julia has been filming an up close and personal documentary for ITV following her breast cancer diagnosis, emphasising that her ‘story continues’ and she is thankful for the support she’s received thus far. She was previously reluctant to look at her chest following surgery, and admitted that she didn’t want to see herself ‘so horribly damaged, bruised and battered’. But, the presenter had the support of her mother and felt able to examine her breasts two months’ later and even agreed to have it filmed as part of the upcoming programme. Julia, who announced in February that her healing was going ‘very well’ after the preocedure as she returned to TV, also revealed that she does not yet have the ‘all clear’ from doctors, after ‘micro-invasions’ – tiny fragments of cancerous cells – leached out of her milk duct and into her breast tissue. Genetic testing has also shown that she has a higher-than-average chance of her cancer returning.
