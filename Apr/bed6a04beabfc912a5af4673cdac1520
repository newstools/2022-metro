A man has been charged with murdering mother-of-two Katie Kenyon, who went missing five days ago. The 33-year-old was last seen at 9.30am on April 22,  when it is believed she travelled in a Ford Transit van which left Burnley towards the Bolton by Bowland area in Lancashire. On Tuesday, detectives said there was ‘slim hope’ of finding her alive and announced the missing person investigation had become a murder probe. Lancashire Police have confirmed 50-year-old Andrew Burfield, from Burnley, has now been charged and will appear at Blackburn Magistrates’ Court on Thursday. Katie’s family have been made aware and continues to be supported by specially trained officers. They have passed on their thanks for all the well-wishing messages but have asked people to respect their privacy at this time. Relatives previously described living in a ‘real life nightmare’ and begged for help in getting the ‘beautiful’ mother home. More than 60 specialist search officers from four police forces scoured a rural beauty spot in Lancashire to find Katie. The hunt involves police and fire service officers, dog teams, mounted police, mountain rescue volunteers and drones. Yesterday, police said that while they had not found a body, they believed Katie was dead. Katie’s family say her disappearance is out of character. As the search continues, her sister, Sarah Kenyon, wrote on Facebook: ‘It is now a waiting game, we have done everything we can, searched everywhere, contacted everyone.’ Anyone with information is asked to get in touch with Lancashire Police or call Crimestoppers.
