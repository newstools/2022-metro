We love a nostalgic jewellery trend – whether it’s Y2K pieces or regencycore pearl necklaces. But the latest trend is combining the two with a summery twist – mixing 90s-look shells (remember that craze?) with opulent pearl details. And when paired with gold toned metal, the vibe is very much mermaid treasure trove. Want to get the look in time for your summer hols? Check out some of our favourite shell-inspired pieces. The traditional seashell shape gets a fun makeover with this gorgeous coral colourway. Buy for £52 from Mercedes Salazar. Chunky gold shells are balanced out by pearl-look details – and they’re a total bargain. Buy for £6.99 from H&M. Remember those plastic-ky shell bracelets you used to wear on holiday as a kid? This is the grown up version. Buy for £90 from Net a Porter. With bright multi-coloured beads and a simple shell detail, this long necklace is ready for the beach bar. Buy for £90 from Smallable. For a subtle nod to the trend, stack this delicate gold ring with some chunkier pieces. Buy for £108 from Alex Monroe. This 18ct gold vermeil necklace looks super elegant on its own but can be layered with shorter necklaces for a bolder look. Buy for £210 from Missoma. This article contains affiliate links.
