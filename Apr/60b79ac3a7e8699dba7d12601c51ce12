Richard Madeley has revealed he has beef with The Chase’s Anne Hegerty in news we didn’t expect. The presenter disclosed he’s not on the best terms with the Governess during Wednesday’s Good Morning Britain after entertainment reporter Vick Hope unearthed the quizzer’s connection to royalty. ‘She’s not my favourite person at the moment,’ Richard quipped, having learned that Anne is a distant relative of Queen Elizabeth II. ‘Oh, really?’ a stunned Vick asked. ‘No,’ Richard responded. ‘I was on The Chase on Saturday and we nearly got a lot of money for charity and she caught me just in the last two minutes.’ ‘We nearly got it,’ he added. ‘But she caught me.’ Ah. Richard appeared on The Chase on Saturday in an all-star line-up, including EastEnders star Perry Fenwick, comedian Jenny Éclair, and presenter Ore Oduba. The team sadly didn’t manage to beat Anne with their general knowledge and lost their £90,000 jackpot. They didn’t leave completely empty-handed though, as Richard, Perry and Ore did manage to secure some cash for their chosen charities. Meanwhile, Anne appeared stunned after discovering that she’s related to the monarch on ITV’s DNA Journey on Tuesday night. She joined The Chase co-star Shaun Wallace on the programme, and at one point, they were speaking to a historian in Edinburgh when it emerged that she had a royal connection. It was soon learned that Anne is the 19th cousin of the monarch, and not only that, but King Robert the Bruce, who was King of Scots from 1306 until his death in 1329, is her 20-times great grandfather. Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV. Got a story?
