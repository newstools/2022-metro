Queen Elizabeth looked on cheery form as she held a face-to-face audience with the president of Switzerland. Her Majesty returned to work at Windsor castle after taking a week-long break to celebrate her 96th birthday at Sandringham last Thursday. Despite experiencing mobility issues in recent months, she stood without her walking stick as she shook hands and posed for photographs with Ignazio Cassis and his wife Paola in her Oak Room sitting room. The audience comes less than 24 hours after her second son, the disgraced Prince Andrew, was stripped of his Freedom of York by councillors in the city, amid further calls to have his dukedom removed. The Queen has also come under rare criticism this week, with protesters in the Caribbean calling on her to apologise for slavery during the Wessex’s royal tour of Saint Lucia. Despite the drama the Queen appeared in good spirits, smiling broadly as she greeted her guests. She was dressed in a blue and grey paisley-style patterned silk dress, matched with her fruit-themed sapphire and diamond grapes brooch inherited from the Queen Mother. Buckingham Palace said the sovereign is hoping to attend the State Opening of Parliament in less than two weeks’ time, on May 10, but confirmation is expected closer to the time or on the day. The Queen has opened Parliament on all but two occasions during her reign. The exceptions were in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant with Andrew and then Prince Edward, when her speech was read by the Lord Chancellor. Her high-profile Platinum Jubilee celebrations are also just over a month away. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
