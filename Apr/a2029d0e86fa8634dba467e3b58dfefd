We’ve all done it – been in a bit of a rush, parked slightly skew-whiff and not had time to correct it. You return to your car and worry you’ve got in someone’s way once you notice you’ve left your vehicle slightly over the lines. But there appeared to be very little excuse for this parking disaster spotted in south Manchester on Saturday. A man called Tom, 43, posted the picture on Facebook of a grey Ford Focus, with the caption: ‘No comment.’ It was taking up two wide parent and child parking bays inside a multi-storey car park near Asda in Wythenshawe. It is not clear whether the owner of the car had any children with them. The dad-of-two said: ‘It didn’t really bother me as the car park was empty, but it’s just to show how selfish some people are.’ Others commented on the ‘disgusting’ parking calling the driver ‘selfish’ and ‘an entitled t**t’. Another person wrote: ‘Yeah I saw this car too, disgusting, no regard for others.’ Someone else added: ‘They should have been issued with a ticket make them think before they do it next time.’ Unless signs indicate otherwise, parents can use these bays if they are accompanied by a child aged under 12 or in a booster seat. Pregnant women using the spaces is a grey area, because the signs specifically refer to parents with children. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
