Cats need entertainment, otherwise they’re going to wreak havoc. You know what that means – scratched up furniture, knocked-over water glasses, the lot. But if you don’t fancy spending yet more money on toys for your feline friend (especially if they’re just going to ignore their presents in favour of the box), never fear – a YouTuber has shared how to DIY something special. Zoir Azimuratov, a content creator from Dushanbe, Tajikistan, has shared a step-by-step tutorial for making your cat their very own toy. All you’ll need is some cardboard, a compass, a crafting knife, hot glue, and some ping pong balls. Zoir said: ‘The trick with my videos is that I make something from scrap materials. ‘It’s a cheap project – a pair of ping pong balls only costs about 10 or 20 cents!’ Do you have a story to share?
