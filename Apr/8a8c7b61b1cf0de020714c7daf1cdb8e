Jurgen Klopp admits Mohamed Salah is going through a ‘tough period’ after his subdued display in Liverpool’s victory over Benfica in the Champions League on Tuesday evening. Ibrahima Kounate and Sadio Mane gave Liverpool a two-goal lead by the break before Darwin Nunez pulled one back for the hosts shortly after half time. But Luis Diaz struck in the closing stages to allow Liverpool to take a 3-1 win back to Anfield for next week’s return leg. Salah, meanwhile, endured another frustrating game as he missed an excellent chance in the first half before being replaced just after the hour mark. After the match, Klopp denied accusations that his exchange with Salah after substituting the Egyptian was brief and stressed that Liverpool’s leading goalscorer this season has been affected by his nation’s failure to qualify for the World Cup later this year. ‘I did nothing different to what I do usually,’ Klopp said when asked about his interaction with Salah after the substitution. ‘If the game is kind of decided then you are a bit more with the players who come off, if the game is open, like it was, you just give a clap and above all the rest you speak later. ‘Each player in that situation wants to score, and obviously with all the stories around, it’s clear Mo wants to score as well, especially in this moment but it’s all fine. ‘It’s a tough period, both boys came back from Africa, it’s really not easy, massive pressure on their shoulders, both have to solve it for their countries. Their managers were part of that as well, to put it on them. ‘I think now he needs time to settle, that’s all. An important game for Mo and Sadio tonight, one could score the other one unfortunately not, but everything will be fine.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
