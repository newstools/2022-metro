Apple’s AirTags have got a bad rap lately for being used to stalk people but when used as intended they can be helpful for keeping track of precious cargo. Especially if a careless airline manages to lose said cargo during transit. Elliot Sharod, used AirTags to track his lost luggage when he was recently travelling back from his wedding in South Africa to the UK. Sharod had placed three of the £29 AirTags on his three checked bags due to fly from Johannesburg to Abu Dhabi; Abu Dhabi to Frankfurt; and Frankfurt to Dublin. ‘I did it because our itinerary was quite robust — we were traveling through multiple airports,’ Sharod told CNN. ‘It was more for security on the way down — the wedding dress and suit weren’t in our cases, but it was for peace of mind,’ The last leg of their complex journey was booked with Aer Lingus from Dublin to London Heathrow. The AirTags which emit tracking alerts via Bluetooth, kept Sharod and his wife updated of the location of their luggage and the couple saw in real time as their bags parted ways with them in Frankfurt. ‘We were annoyed, frustrated and tired by that point, but still optimistic — we thought, hey, they’ll stick it on a flight. We didn’t think any more of it,’ said Sharod. The Aer Lingus staff they’d contacted promised the couple that the bags would be rerouted from Frankfurt to London and delivered directly to Sharods’ home address in Surrey. While they did do this, only two of the three bags reached Sharod. The third suitcase, containing wedding mementos, according to its Airtag, was at a random address in Pimlico. After no success with customer support, Sharod took to social media to outline the journey of his bag with the AirTag still inside in a PowerPoint presentation and tagged the airline. Launched in April last year, the AirTags once linked to an Apple device, can be traced to their location within meters. According to Apple, AirTags send out a ‘secure Bluetooth signal that can be detected by nearby devices in the Find My network’. These devices send the location of your AirTag to iCloud from where you can track it. Four days after the suitcase went missing, Sharod’s AirTag has let them know that it made two journeys within a couple of blocks of its Pimlico location and hasn’t moved since. The couple now believe the bag has been stolen and reported it to the police. The AirTag may very well be key in solving the case and reuniting Sharod with his lost bag. In January, a number of women told the BBC they had been followed using AirTags. Apple has addressed the stalking concerns by issuing software updates and working on new safety features.
