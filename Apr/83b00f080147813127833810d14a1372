Travel is back on the table. And one of the best ways to explore a new country, soaking up different stops along the way, is through a good old-fashioned road trip. Whether it’s Route 66 in the US or the North Coast 500 in Scotland, a few spring to mind when we think of famous ones. But new research has shed light on the most underrated road trips. A new study by Confused.com has listed 10 of the lesser-known and understated routes to add to your bucket list. Scoping first place is the the Causeway Coastal Route in Northern Ireland – with more than 98% positive reviews on Tripadvisor, but just 23,700 online searches last year. Following close behind is the Route des Crêtes in France – a 89km trip that goes through the Vosges Mountains in the east of the country. Only 131,200 people searched for this route last year – despite the trip having 99% positive reviews on Tripadvisor. Perhaps unsurprisingly, American routes dominated the top 10, with the Foothills Parkway claiming third position – known for going through the Great Smoky Mountains in East Tennessee. This road trip was followed by Lamar Valley, Trail Ridge Road and Beartooth Highway, in fourth, fifth and sixth positions, respectively. The comparison platform also put together the most overrated road trips, with Nandi Hills coming in first place, followed by Route 66 and Road to Hana – both in the US. The North Coast 500 in Scotland also made it onto this second list in joint seventh position, along with the 17-Mile Drive in the US and the Carretera Austral route – down Chile’s southern highway.
