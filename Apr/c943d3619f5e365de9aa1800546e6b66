Victoria Beckham celebrated her 48th birthday on Sunday with an epic throwback picture from her ninth birthday as friends and family, new and old, sent their best wishes to the Spice Girl-turned-fashion-designer. Taking to Instagram in the morning, Victoria marked her special day by sharing an adorable throwback snap from a childhood birthday, showing her beaming in a prink frilly blouse as she was presented with a cake. Thanking her mother Jackie, and updating the pic with a jaunty paper crown, Victoria wrote: ‘Feels like yesterday! My 9th birthday party 🎂😂 Happy Birthday to me 🥳🥳 love you @jackie.adams_ 💕’ Football icon husband David, 46, posted a sweet tribute to ‘the most amazing wife, mummy & Business woman’, alongside a snap of the couple sharing a smooch on the beach by a bonfire in the evening. ‘Have the most amazing day because you deserve to x We all love you so much ❤️ @victoriabeckham @brooklynpeltzbeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham #HarperSeven ❤️,’ he added. Oldest son Brooklyn, 23, who married new wife Nicola Peltz in a lavish wedding ceremony just last weekend, shared a snap of his mum taking to the dancefloor with her mother Jackie and his new bride, and commented: ‘Happy birthday mum @victoribeckham love u.’ Nicola, 27, who has combined surnames with her new hubby, also posted a picture of herself with her arm around Victoria and her own mum Claudia to marl her new mother-in-law’s birthday. Son Romeo, 19, shared a casual photo of himself enjoying dinner with both of his parents, with Victoria throwing up a peace sign to the camera as he praised her as ‘the best mum in the world’, a sentiment Victoria’s youngest son Cruz, 17, agreed with in his birthday tribute to his mum, which was a throwback picture of him being held in Victoria’s arms at a Real Madrid match when he was a tot. Victoria’s former Spice Girl pals also came through with some excellent throwback snaps from their time together in the chart-topping girl band. Geri Horner, who shared two photos of her and Victoria cuddling, wrote: ‘Happy birthday ! @victoriabeckham – what a woman! 😘 Wishing you the best year ahead. Xxx’ Meanwhile, Emma Bunton’s collection of snaps involved a silly selfie, as well as a picture of them walking a red carpet hand-in-hand and in chunky heels together and a more recent picture of the pair messing around for a photo together with both David and Emma’s husband Jade Jones. Victoria saw Brooklyn married off in style at Nicola’s billionaire family’s Florida estate last weekend, where the fashionista mother-of-the-groom donned a silvery gown that took five days to make as well as a £2million diamond and yellow gold necklace.
