Brooklyn Beckham has recalled how ‘beautiful’ his new wife Nicola Peltz looked as she met him down the aisle at their wedding. The lovebirds married at Nicola’s family home in Palm Beach, Florida on Saturday in front of 300 guests, including Brooklyn’s parents David and Victoria Beckham, and celebrity guests including Spice Girls Mel B and Mel C, Serena Williams and Gordon Ramsay. On Sunday, the newlyweds shared the first photos from their lavish nuptials with British Vogue doing the honours of documenting the big day. Alongside a photo of Nicola in her stunning Valentino wedding dress, chef Brooklyn wrote: ‘My beautiful bride,’ with two heart emoji. The 23-year-old chef also confirmed that he will be taking Nicola’s last name, adding alongside another: ‘Mr. & Mrs. Peltz Beckham.’ Nicola, 27, also returned to social media as a wife and thanked Valentino team for creating her ‘dream dress’, before sharing a photo of her beloved father and writing: ‘Thank you for the most beautiful weekend of my life. You’re the wind beneath my wings.’ His mother, Spice Girls star Victoria led the stream of congratulations for the happy couple, and wrote in her own Instagram post: ‘Congratulations Mr and Mrs Beckham X Welcome to the family,’ to which Nicola replied: ‘Thank you.’ Brooklyn’s dad and former footballer David shared a photo of himself with sons Brooklyn, Romeo, 19, and Cruz, 17, in their wedding suits, writing in the caption: ‘My beautiful boys 💙💙💙 & a very proud dad.. Congratulations Bust on a lifetime of happiness, we will always be by your side ❤️@brooklynbeckham @romeobeckham @cruzbeckham we love you @victoriabeckham ❤️’ The stunning ceremony took place at the sprawling estate belonging to Nicola’s billionaire parents Nelson and Claudia on Saturday evening. It incorporated both Jewish and Catholicism and reportedly set the couple back $3million. Nicola wore a Valentino couture wedding gown featuring the most show-stopping train, as well as secret details such as an evil eye as a talisman designed by her mother Claudia, as well as a personal message stitched into the dress using blue thread by the design team. Brooklyn wore a smart custom Dior suit. Kicking off the wedding reception, Brooklyn and Nicola made their debut as a married couple on the dancefloor, where they shared their first dance to Elvis Presley’s Only Fools Rush In performed by a live band. It appears they partied until the early hours as Serena Williams revealed she was struggling to go to bed at 4am. Got a story?
