If you’re finding it hard to get out of bed with your basic alarm, there’s a Doomsday Alarm Clock that will jolt you wide awake. True to its name, the Doomsday Alarm Clock lets you choose an apocalyptic scenario to wake up to. Examples include global warming, volcanic eruption, nuclear war and even an evil AI. ‘Wake up to how the world could end’ says the app’s home screen from where you can set your alarm. Once you set your alarm and pick the the doomsday scenario of your choice you can wake up to disturbing news and bone-chilling facts about how the world might end. You can download the app for free on the Apple App Store, the developers encourage users to donate to EarthJustice, ‘to avoid our actual doomsday’. Of course there’s no shortage of bad news to wake up to from the world on a ‘fast track’ to climate disaster, dystopian drones enforcing lockdowns to prevent the spread of a virus that nearly shut the world down for years. It’s hard to pick which sound is the most disturbing but the Evil AI more which says ‘I’m just a smartphone app watching you sleep’ before wishing you ‘Good morning’, really gives you the chills. So if chaos is what gets you going in the morning, you might want to try this new and rather depressing way to start the day.
