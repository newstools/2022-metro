Phillip Schofield missed out on the warm weather in the UK this Easter weekend after jetting off on a ski holiday with actor Luke Evans and interior designer Kelly Hoppen. The This Morning presenter made the most of his time off from the ITV programme to book a snowy trip to the French Alps. However, in addition to Kelly, he’s randomly been joined by Beauty and the Beast actor Luke revealing a friendship we never knew existed. In his Instagram stories, Phillip shared a photo of him posing with Luke and another friend with the snow-capped mountains in the backdrop. Making a forgivable skiing-pun, he quipped: ‘Now they’re taking the p**s #easy.’ Another photo shows him sharing food with Luke, which he captioned: ‘@thereallukeevans travels with a picnic!’ while Kelly is seen being blown backwards by a gust of wind in the chilly climes. The trip appears to have been organised by Kelly and her husband John as Phillip revealed: ‘The best host @kellyhoppen 🥰 ‘@kellyhoppen ‘s hubby John generous host and brilliant ski instructor.’ During the getaway, Luke celebrated his 43rd birthday and was presented with a cake from the group complete with candles. ‘What a very special few days I’ve had,’ he wrote in an Instagram post. ‘With some truly brilliant human beings. Thank you for making my 43rd birthday go off with a bang! ‘Especially @kellbell_red and Big John for being the most epic of hosts, and for @justinhornechef making me a tasty AF birthday cake! It’s been wonderful. 🙏🏼 I blew out the candles Delta Force” style…apparently!!’ However, all good things come to an end and the group were forced to pack up their belongings and fly back home on Monday. ‘We don’t want to go!!! @kellyhoppen @bendelisi @thereallukeevans,’ Phillip admitted, preparing to get a big case of the holiday blues.
