The government is reviewing a proposal for a new cross-river tram line that will connect Essex and Kent. The ‘KenEx’ tram would see a new tunnel run under the River Thames, parallel to the existing Dartford Crossing, between Thurrock and Gravesend. Developers want it to run along the Thames Estuary linking Dartford, Swanscombe, Gravesend, Ebbsfleet International and Grays. If completed, it would cover a 30km distance, including a 1.2km tunnel under the river. The main incentive for the line is to remove the cross-river barrier between north Kent, where there is high levels of unemployment, and south Essex, where there are a number of job opportunities. There are a number of housing developments across the route, including a 10,000-home ‘city’ in Ebbsfleet Garden City. Proponents say it would offer a green alternative to the congested Dartford Crossing, which will combat pollution from the area and remove an estimated 10 per cent of traffic from local roads. Currently, there is just one hourly bus across the Dartford Crossing or the Tilbury-Gravesend Ferry. The KenEx tram line is estimated to cost around £800m. If the plans are given the go-ahead by the government, developers will have to put together a full case for the project. ‘The tram hits the sweet spot, we envisage a base case of 10 million journeys a year at a minimum – taking a part of the 55 million who use the Dartford Crossing, the 25 million who travel to Lakeside, the 13million at local rail stations on the route,’ the project’s managing director Gordon Pratt told MyLondon. ‘People can see the benefits of a ten minute tram journey across the river instead of 30 minutes plus on the Dartford Crossing.’ The DfT confirmed a business case had been submitted, with a decision expected later this year.
