Two people were killed and almost 50 more had to be rescued after a terrifying cable car collision. Some passengers were left dangling high above the ground for nearly two days in a terrifying incident in India. The tragedy occured on a route used by pilgrims to reach the top of Trikut, a hill considered holy in the Hindu religion. Military rescuers had to be called in when one car broke loose from the cable and smashed into another. Video of the operation showed people, including at least one young child, being individually lifted up the helicopter on a harness. The rocky slopes of the near 2,500ft peak can be seen below the jammed cable cars. The force of the impact killed one person and another fell to their death while trying to climb aboard an aircraft. Police in Jharkhand state’s Deoghar told international news agencies everyone had now been brought to safety. Most of the survivors were rescued on Monday but three remaining people were not lifted to safety until Tuesday. Subhash Chandra Jat, the police chief of Deoghar, where the incident occurred in remote hilly territory, confirmed the news. Neither car fell to the ground but both became immobilised and were left hanging above the ground. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
