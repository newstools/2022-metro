I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! could still return to Wales for another series despite fans gearing up for the show to head back to Australia. The hit ITV show, fronted by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, relocated to Gwrych Castle in Wales for the past two years due to Covid travel restrictions. While the network has already stressed that the programme is likely to return Down Under in November, it has been reported that custodians of the castle ‘have applied for approval to keep the temporary structures built by crew for another year’. Covers were temporarily installed over sections of the Grade 1 listed building during filming last year, in order for the set to be safe for production. Permission has to be requested every year because of the venue’s structure, and it’s now been claimed that another 12 months’ authorisation has been demanded. ‘It was all looking so hopeful that it would be back in Oz but news like this does make that look less likely,’ an insider said. They added to The Sun: ‘Hopefully, ITV are just being prudent and covering all eventualities.’ The potential curveball has come after ITVs Director of Content Rosemary Newell said: ‘We expect I’m a celebrity to return in Australia in November’. Presenter Ant also fuelled excitement for the show’s Australia return during an appearance on The One Show in February. ‘Well, the plan is the jungle, so if all things…,’ he said, to Dec chimed in: ‘Nothing against Wales!’ Ant then added: ‘We love Wales but you know, Australia is its home and we’d like to get back there if we can.’ I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! is expected to return to ITV later this year.
