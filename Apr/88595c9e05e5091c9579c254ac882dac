Not only is Coachella a music and fashion extravaganza, beauty lovers get their fill too. Hair and makeup is big business at the American music festival and Coachella beauty trends can influence festival style for the rest of year. Coachella is a time to truly experiment and all beauty rules of everyday life are thrown out the window. This year it seems everything is bigger, brighter and more sparkly. People are taking joy in the normal resumption of life and this can be seen in the trends we have witnessed so far. The beauty vibe is most definitely go big or go home and we can’t get enough of it. And so, here are five key beauty trends from Coachella 2022 that we have spotted so far. A hair look that’s both easy and stunning, baby braids are a festival must. Hassle free, they add a point of difference to any look. It wouldn’t be Coachella without some sparkle, and facial gemstones can be seen everywhere in the desert. For a subtle look add them to your eyes only, but if you want a ‘wow’ look, add as many as you like. Space buns are another festival stalwart, but this year at Coachella they have become an accessory. The beloved hairstyle is now bejewelled and we are welcoming this trend with open arms. Florals and festivals go hand in hand and when we saw this beauty look on Riverdale star Lili Reinhart, we immediately started practicing drawing our daisies on paper. A perfect option for those who prefer a boho vibe during festival season. At Coachella 2022, eyeliner was bright and bold. Many opted to add a pop of colour to their beauty looks and it’s an easy way to dip your toe into brighter hues without becoming overwhelmed. Do you have a story to share?
