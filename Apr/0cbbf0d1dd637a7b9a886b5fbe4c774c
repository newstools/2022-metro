Petru-Sorin Doleanu, 41, fell ill and was taken to hospital with a serious brain injury at December 18. The night before, at around 9pm, he was out with two friends in Wembley, north London and was an approached by a man and got into a fight. Petru-Sorin ended up staying in hospital and eventually died on March 29. A post-mortem examination gave the causes of death as pneumonia and a head injury. Leading the investigation is Detective Inspector Jack Stilwell, who said: ‘The past few months have been extremely challenging for Petru-Sorin’s family and friends. ‘While it has been clear for some time that his injuries were extensive, his death has understandably been very difficult for them to come to terms with. ‘Our investigation has determined that on the night of December 17, shortly before 9pm, Petru-Sorin was with two friends near the Job Centre in St John’s Road, Wembley. They were approached by an unknown male. ‘There was an altercation and Petru-Sorin was assaulted, sustaining the injuries that led to him being hospitalised the following day. ‘We have carried out extensive enquiries and have released a CCTV image of a man we want to speak to about this incident.’ Anyone with information is asked to contact police.
