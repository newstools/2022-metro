Police have applied to extend the bail of Manchester United’s Mason Greenwood following his arrest on suspicion of rape, assault and threats to kill. The England international was arrested and questioned in January in relation to audio recordings and images which were posted on social media by a woman reporting violence. Greenwood was subsequently suspended by United and has not played for the club or trained at its facilities since then. His bail was due to expire on 30 April but Greater Manchester Police, who are conducting the investigation, have applied for an extension. The application for the bail extension must be heard in court, with that hearing unlikely to take place until mid-June. Greenwood will remain under his current bail terms until then. A statement issued by GMP read: ‘We are continuing to investigate a report made to us on Sunday 30 January of online social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence. ‘A 20-year-old man arrested that day on suspicion of the rape and assault of a woman, and threats to kill, remains on bail. ‘An application has been made to the courts to have his bail extended beyond Saturday 30 April, but the hearing isn’t expected to be until mid-June. ‘The suspect will remain on conditional bail until the date of the court hearing.’ Greenwood’s most recent United appearance came against West Ham United in the Premier League on 22 January. Since then his commercial agreement with sportswear giant Nike has been cancelled, and his likeness was removed from EA Sports’ football video game FIFA 22. He made his first-team debut for the club in 2018 after progressing through its academy ranks, and has played once for the senior England squad. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
