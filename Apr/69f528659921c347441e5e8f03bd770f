A man has been fined after claiming he chopped down part of his neighbour’s hedge to enhance his view. During a campaign of harassment, Alexander Edwards cut the hole in a hedge belonging to Ian Cox claiming he wanted to get a better view of the Welsh mountains. However, after hearing that Edwards also got his dog to back late at night, sang rap music at anti-social hours and shone a torch at a CCTV camera, he was hauled before the court. Edwards’ mother Jane had started an ongoing feud with Mr Cox around eight years ago. When Edwards moved into his mother’s house in Pengarth, Conwy, he became embroiled in the row. Mr Cox kept a detailed a log of all the incidents that he suffered, often in the early hours of the morning. The 7ft hole appeared in Mr Cox’s hedge on July 5, 2021 and Edwards admitted that he had done it to better see the mountains from his bedroom window. He sang ‘I’m f**king gonna kill yer’ in one of his lyrics and the dogs would be goaded into barking at midnight or 1am. On August 2 he stuck his middle finger up at Mr Cox. On January 4 he did that again and then ran after him, causing alarm. Later the same day he spat at Mr Cox’s van window. The behaviour left Mr Cox unable to use his own garden. Graham Parry, defending Edwards, said he had a view down the valley but the hedge had grown out of control. District Judge Gwyn Jones told Edwards in the dock: ‘For whatever reason, you got embroiled in a dispute which is not of your making. ‘Whatever the rights and wrongs of this matter, you conducted a series of little acts which caused harassment to your neighbour. It was anti-social behaviour.’ The District Judge noted that Edwards had never ‘troubled the courts’ before but he added: ‘I’m satisfied that this offence is serious enough to justify a community order.’ He was told to do 80 hours of community service and must not talk to Mr Cox for four years. He must pay £180 to the court.
