Coffees and doughnuts are about to get even more exciting in the capital. Canadian institution Tim Hortons will be opening its first restaurant spot in London later this year – complete with a drive-thru. The restaurant will be located at Royale Leisure Park, in West London, and is set to offer breakfast, lunch and dinner options – including the brand’s bestsellers such as Timbits, French vanilla coffee and the crispy chicken sandwich. The London branch of Tim Hortons will have space for more than 100 guests to dine in – or people can take away via the drive-thru. Delivery options will also be available once it’s up and running – although an exact date is yet to be revealed. To celebrate the opening, a series of giveaways and deals will be on the brand’s social media over the coming weeks – so stay tuned for a chance to win. Currently, there are 51 UK outposts of Tim Hortons with flagship locations in Birmingham, Belfast and Leicester city centre. Although, the brand have hinted at plans to expand in London, too. Kevin Hydes, chief commercial officer of Tim Hortons in the UK, said: ‘ It feels like now is the right time to make our move into the capital and Park Royal offers a great drive-thru and dine-in location for our guests, with travellers able to come from across London to enjoy their Tim Hortons fix. ‘We pride ourselves on our quality and value offering and know our versatile menu will be hugely popular to Londoners. ‘This is just the start of our inception into London, and we cannot wait to share further details in the coming months.’ Do you have a story to share?
