Cristiano Ronaldo is set to return to the Manchester United side for Saturday’s clash with Arsenal following the death of his new-born son. The 37-year-old was given compassionate leave this week and missed Tuesday’s defeat to Liverpool following the tragic news. Ronaldo was back at United’s Carrington training base on Wednesday with United boss Ralf Rangnick confirming he is available for selection for Saturday’s trip to north London. Recent injury absentees Scott McTominay and Raphael Varane are both also in contention to return to the side. ‘Scott McTominay will be back and fit to play, he has been training with us and will train today for the game tomorrow,’ Rangnick told a press conference. ‘The same with Raphael Varane and obviously Ronaldo is available again, he has been training with us.’ Ronaldo and his partner Georgina Rodriguez revealed in October that they were expecting twins but announced this week that their newborn son had died during childbirth, while their daughter survived. Ronaldo and Rodriguez returned home with their baby daughter this week with the United striker sharing a family picture to his 430million followers on Thursday. ‘Home sweet home,’ Ronaldo wrote. ‘Gio and our baby girl are finally together with us. We want to thank everyone for all the kind words and gestures. ‘Your support is very important and we all felt the love and respect that you have for our family. Now it’s time to be grateful for the life that we’ve just welcomed into this world.’ Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in his last game for United in the 3-2 win over Norwich.
