We’ve all heard of a bull in a china shop but this takes the biscuit. A young bullock found himself taking an unexpected dip after breaking loose from its field. The 600kg animal went exploring South Devon but soon ran into trouble when it ventured into a local garden. Three crews from Paignton, Torquay and Exmouth Fire Stations were drafted in last night to hoist the bull out of the pool. After four hours of tough, nerve-wracking work, the animal was brought to safety and is doing fine. Rob Cude, group manager at Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, said: ‘The plan of action was to feed webbing strops under the (bullock) after getting him in the corner of the pool, then bring in a telehandler and lift him out supported comfortably. ‘Whilst this was ongoing, a local farmer positioned a cattle trailer ready for him to move straight into. ‘The operation went very smoothly, (bullock) lifted, moved to the trailer, and was then held in the harness for a few minutes until he could support himself again. By this time, he had been in the pool for three to fours hours and was very cold, with obviously numb legs.’ But Mr Cude said the animal coped well in the water, which was partially drained. He continued: ‘He did spend quite some time with his nose just below the surface blowing bubbles, which he seemed to enjoy. ‘When they started pumping out the water, he seemed to swim along the pool and investigate the pump. ‘All (were) relieved to see him safe and well.’ Once the bullock had been lifted out of the pool and released from his harness, he was moved into a cattle trailer and taken back to the local farm to recover from his dip. Mr Cude added: ‘A really good outcome for one very cold young bullock.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
