Ever wanted to hang out with a tiny version of The Queen? Of course you have. Now, you won’t have to make do with a paper cut-out, as Mattel has unveiled a special Queen Elizabeth II Barbie, to be released on the Queen’s 96th birthday on Thursday. In celebration of the Platinum Jubilee, the doll version of The Queen isn’t wearing one of her usual brightly coloured twinsets, but instead a formal ivory gown, a tiara (modelled on the one the Queen wore on her wedding day), and a blue ribbon adorned with decorations of order. The pink ribbon on the doll’s sash gives a nod to the one given to the Queen by her father George VI, and the pale blue one refers to the ribbon handed down from her grandfather George V. Spot the little silver brooch pinned underneath? That represents the Garter Star, the insignia of the highest order of chivalry in the UK. The Queen doll forms part of Barbie’s Tribute Collection, which launched in 2021 to celebrate ‘visionary individuals with an outstanding impact and legacy within society’. Alas, the doll version of the Queen hasn’t been given her own tiny corgi (sort it out, Mattel) but it will be sold in a box inspired by Buckingham Palace, made from a 3D ornate die-cut border framing the figure, and an inner panel showing the throne and the red carpet of the throne room. Snazzy. It’s all based off a portrait commissioned to mark her 60th year on the throne back in 2012. No word yet on the price for this fun bit of memorabilia, but we do know the doll will be sold at Harrods, Hamley’s, Selfridges, John Lewis, and Amazon. Do you have a story to share?
