A three-year-old boy from Irpin captured the hearts of millions of people when he performed a popular song by a Ukrainian rock band at a charity concert. Fighting back tears, the audience in the Kyiv metro station fell silent when rosy-cheeked Leonard Bush appeared on a live screen to sing ‘Not Your War’ along with Okean Elzy on Orthodox Easter Sunday. Earlier this month, the boy went viral after his performance of another insurgent hymn popularised during the war in Ukraine. Leonard’s family recently relocated to the west of the country after their home Irpin, which was given the status of Hero City, turned into a ghost area under Russia’s attacks. According to local media, the youngster had been preparing for days for his national debut, which was broadcasted by a number of TV channels in Ukraine, as well as in 14 other countries. Called ‘I will be kind’, the charity concert was organised by Okean Elzy and held at the Golden Gate metro station in the capital. It helped bring funds for the Tvoya Opora charity for children affected by the war. Many praised little Leonard for his bravery, performing to such a big audience, while others said his song made them very emotional. This is also not the first time the musical talent of Ukrainian children has brought attention to Russian atrocities in their homeland. In March, Amelia Anisovych gave a moving rendition of Let It Go from Frozen from a shelter in Kyiv in a bid to lift everyone’s spirits during the ongoing invasion. Like Leonard’s, the heartwarming video also became an Internet sensation, with millions of people across the world watching it. Last month also saw violinists from 29 countries releasing a touching performance of the folk song ‘Verbovaya Doschechka’ to show solidarity with their counterparts in Ukraine.
