A woman ‘in danger’ was able to subtly get help by pretending to order a pizza. The quick-thinking woman called police while feeling scared of a man on a bus in North Yorkshire on Tuesday. Rather than telling her to only use 999 for emergencies, the operator recognised she could be in trouble. Using ‘yes’ or ‘no’ questions, the call handler established she was on a bus and felt at risk of harm. While keeping the phone line open, staff also text her for more information. Police used an online tracker to find the bus and stopped it in York. A man, 40, from Leeds, was arrested but has since been released with no further action. The force said the woman had been given safeguarding and support. Inspector Dan Spence said: ‘This was really good work by everyone involved, allowing us to take immediate action to safeguard a vulnerable woman. ‘I’m aware of people using the “pizza ordering” technique abroad to contact the police, but I cannot recall a similar call in North Yorkshire.’ All 999 calls are automatically directed to operators hired by BT. They ask what service the caller needs and passes the person on to the right department. If the operator hears anything suspicious in the call, they are supposed to connect it to a police handler. Although it’s easiest when the potential victim can talk, some use coughing or phone keys to communicate. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
