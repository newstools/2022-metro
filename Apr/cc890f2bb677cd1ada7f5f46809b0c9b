Have you ever looked at a row of books on a shelf and thought: ‘Wow, they look comfortable and well-rested?’ Well, for just £149,000, you too can benefit from the comforts most inanimate objects enjoy every day. For that price, you can get your lucky hands on an Edinburgh studio flat which gets around its limited space by putting the bed on a ‘mezzanine’ shelf. The ‘bedroom’ is accessible via a small ladder and sits very close to the ceiling – but who wants to sit up in bed anyway? On the market with estate agents ESPC, the rest of the apartment looks pretty normal. There’s a lounge/kitchen/dining area with some floor to ceiling storage, and double glazing throughout. The bathroom is off the hallway and has a shower over a bath. There’s even room for a corner sofa, of which you’ll have a bird’s-eye view from your bed shelf. There’s a shared garden outside and you enter the flat via an entry-phone system. The listing describes the apartment as ‘an ideal starter home for a first-time buyer or a buy-to-let investor’. Don’t say the property market never did anything for you! Do you have a story to share?
