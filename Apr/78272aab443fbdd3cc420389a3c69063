There’s a lot of chat about porn and tractors today. What two sites with similar names provide tractor information and pornography? How does one go from the mindset of wanting to look at some farm vehicles to enjoying erotica? These are just a few of the big questions on our mind. If this topic has prompted you to ponder the sexiness of tractors more deeply, we’re here to help. Yes, in case you were wondering, there is all manner of tractor-themed porn out there for you to enjoy if you so choose, but if you want to incorporate this humble hauler into your love making, you’re in luck, too. And no, you don’t even need access to your own big-wheeler. Instead, you can simply try out the tractor sex position. Okay, so do you know the wheelbarrow? In this position, you do doggy, and then the person getting penetrated has their legs lifted up and back, while the person penetrating holds them in place. This allows for deep thrusting action and G-spot stimulation. Fun stuff. The tractor is the same thing, but with anal instead of vaginal penetration. Don’t think too deeply into why this is called the tractor (something about hauling or mud, don’t ask), but if you do feel like trying this, make sure to use plenty of lube, taking things slow, and stop if there’s any pain. Anal sex shouldn’t hurt. You’ll also need good balance and arm strength. If it gets a bit much, have the person penetrating kneel, and the receiver resting on their elbows rather than doing a full wheelbarrow. When it comes to the tractor, slow, steady, and gentle wins the race. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
