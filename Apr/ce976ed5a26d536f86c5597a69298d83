Many of us receive a few measly sex education lessons in school, then… that’s it. We’re left to navigate the world of love and dating without knowledge of all sorts of key things, like female pleasure (hardly mentioned, in our experience) and gender and sexuality. No wonder then, that myths so easily get passed around and take hold. While we might have grown out of urban legends of getting pregnant from toilet seats or using chocolate bar wrappers as condoms, there are some sex-related falsehoods adults are holding on to. And the myths that are most prevelant vary a bit between the genders, says a new report from Illicit Encounters. The most common sex myth held by women, for example, is that women tend to have lower sex drives than men. Spoiler: that’s not the case. And one that’s super common about men: that they think about sex every seven seconds. In fact, only 10% of men surveyed admitted to thinking about sex ‘all the time’. ‘Lots of myths grow up around sex that tend to stick,’ says sexpert Jessica Leoni. ‘Who hasn’t eaten an oyster and mentioned that they are a well-known aphrodisiac, when there is no evidence to show they make you feel sexy?’ Do you have a story to share?
