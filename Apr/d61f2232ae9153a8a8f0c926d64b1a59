Nikki Grahame’s fans have sent their love and support to her mother Sue after she spoke openly about her daughter’s death in the new documentary, Who Is She?. The Big Brother star died in April last year at the age of 38 following a life-long battle with anorexia. During the Channel 4 documentary, which marks a year since Nikki died, Sue recalled some of the happiest moments of her daughter’s life, including winning a National Television Award, as well as the heartbreak of losing her. One particularly emotional moment saw Sue saying she sometimes sleeps round Nikki’s flat, holding the Pingu teddy she was cuddling when she died. ‘I cuddle him every night now because actually it brings me a bit closer to Nikki,’ she explained. Sue also said she hangs the dress Nikki wore to the NTAs up and looks at it before she goes to sleep and when she wakes up, as it was her daughter’s happiest moment. ‘It was the happiest day of her life,’ Sue recalled. ‘I have never seen her more proud and happy as I did that night.’ ‘Nikki’s Mum is so brave talking about Nikki’s struggle with anorexia,’ one fan wrote. ‘Can’t even begin to imagine how helpless she would feel wanting to help her daughter.’ My heart goes out to Nikki’s Mum, cuddling her Pingu and looking at that dress. So sad. Anorexia is such a terrible illness,’ another said. One more fan wrote: ‘Pingu broke my heart. This is very difficult to watch.’ Nikki rose to fame on the seventh series of Big Brother in 2006. She immediately struck a chord with viewers and has gone down in reality TV history for her bubbly personality, as well as her absolutely iconic catchphrases, including the immortal: ‘Who is she?!’ During the documentary, Sue credited the show with saving her daughter’s life.
