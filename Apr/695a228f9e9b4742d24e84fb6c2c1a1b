A lucky Brit could soon get their hands on a life-changing sum after no one took home the National Lottery jackpot last night. An estimated £4 million is up for grabs following a dry night for players on Wednesday. The Thunderball £500,000 top prize also went unclaimed as people scooped only small wins. Eighty-five ticket holders managed to net themselves £1,750 each after matching five numbers on the main Lotto draw. But the biggest payout of the night went to a Thunderball player who won £5,000 by matching the same number of balls in that game. The winning Lotto numbers were 03, 17, 23, 24, 30, 49 with the bonus ball 59. The Thunderball numbers were 04, 07, 09, 20, 37 with the Thunderball 05. Set of balls nine was used with draw machine Guinevere. It comes as one player takes lottery operator Camelot to court after her thrill of winning £1 million on a scratchcard fell to pieces. Joan Parker-Grennan thought she was the ‘luckiest person in Britain’ after bagging the seven-figure prize. But she was left devastated after being told her success was a ‘technical glitch’ in the system – and she had only won £10. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
