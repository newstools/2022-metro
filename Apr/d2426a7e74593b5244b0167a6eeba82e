Manchester United’s board were left with two concerns after interviewing Erik ten Hag for the manager’s role at Old Trafford. The Dutchman was interviewed by United officials last month and was the first candidate that the Red Devils opted to speak to, making him the favourite for the job at Old Trafford. However, the Independent report that Ten Hag’s interview raised concerns with United’s board for two reasons. First, the Dutchman was said to have ‘not blown people away’ because of a lack of charisma. Ten Hag spoke to Tottenham about joining the club last summer but Daniel Levy also felt the Dutch coach lacked a strong personality. Certainly compared to Mauricio Pochettino, it’s felt that Ten Hag’s lack of personality could be a problem at a club of Manchester United’s size. The second concern was Ten Hag’s lack of Premier League experience. United are wary of appointing a manger from the Netherlands as they’ve been scarred in the past with signings from Holland. The Red Devils have spent a combined £70m on Donny van de Beek and Memphis Depay in recent years and neither player has been able to replicate the form they showed in their homeland in the Premier League. Nevertheless, it’s said Ten Hag is still the favourite for the job at Old Trafford but his interview has left a window of opportunity for challengers like Pochettino.
