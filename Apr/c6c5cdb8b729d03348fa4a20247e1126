The owner of a farm in North Wales is ‘still in shock’ days after a tornado toppled trees, sent debris flying and launched her sheep into the air. Extreme weather on Wednesday left behind £100,000 worth of damage at Gogarth Hall Farm in Pennal. Investigators confirmed yesterday that a tornado had hit the farm, with ‘plenty of evidence’ that objects had been spun around before falling back to the ground. Owner Deilwen Breese said she was away from the farm when she received a phone call telling her to come home. ‘I thought it was just that part of the roof had gone. But oh my god, when I came home I could not believe it,’ she said. ‘The devastation, it was heartbreaking. I am still in shock, really. Trees had been lifted from their roots. ‘If they hadn’t been lifted they had just been tarnished. We have lost hundreds of trees.’ She said the wind was so strong it ‘took a ewe out through the bay of a shed’ and ‘picked up the little lambs’. Ms Breese says the lambs are all okay but that the ewe was ‘gone’. ‘When I got to the farm I could see the damage to the roof, it’s about £100,000 worth of damage on the roof’ she added. The owner said a group of 12 local volunteers were now helping her clear the devastation. But fearing the farm will not be the same, she said: ‘It’s going to take months, it will never get back, not in my lifetime. It will never come back to what it was.’ The Tornado and Storm Research Organisation said it had investigated the site and believed that the damage was caused by a T3 level tornado. Investigator John Mason said he believed the twister had a strength of between 93mph-114mph. He told the BBC: ‘A T10 is like the ones you get in the States, but a T3 is still strong.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
