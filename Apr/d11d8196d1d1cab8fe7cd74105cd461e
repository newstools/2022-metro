Ricky Hatton has dismissed Tyson Fury’s claim that he is retiring from boxing and claims the Gypsy King wants to fight Anthony Joshua and Oleksandr Usyk before walking away from the sport. Fury extended his unbeaten record with another dominant performance as he dominated Dillian Whyte before stopping him with a KO in the sixth round at Wembley on Saturday evening. The 33-year-old is adamant that he has now retired from boxing and will only take part in exhibition fights, with a bout against UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou on his wishlist. But Hatton, who is close friends with Fury, believes the Gypsy King still has his eye on two more fights before he calls it a day. ‘I don’t think he’ll retire,’ Hatton told Boxing Social after Fury’s win over Whyte. ‘I know he wants to fight Usyk, he wants to fight Joshua. ‘I think he’ll retire just so Eddie [Hearn] and AJ pull their fingers out. ‘He might retire and say, ‘well I’m retiring now’, if Eddie and AJ think they’ve lost it they might stand a better chance of getting it on. ‘I think Tyson is a fighting man, he just loves to fight doesn’t he? ‘I think Tyson will be on his settee in five years’ time and think, ‘I’ll give it another go’. That’s Tyson isn’t it? ‘The reason why we went into this game is to try and become the best. ‘Tyson’s the best, Usyk is number two and AJ is just behind there, you want to fight the best, Tyson’s the best, you don’t want to retire without fighting the best, do you? I think they’ll want to get it on.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
