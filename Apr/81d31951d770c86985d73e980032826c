Shoppers had a narrow escape on after a car ploughed into a Tesco Express and smashed through the window. Dramatic photos show the destroyed frontage of the store in Dunfermline, Fife, following the smash on Thursday evening. A police officer was even pictured sweeping glass with a broom in one photo after the grey Skoda car hit the shop. Neither Police Scotland or Tesco could determine the cause of the crash when contacted – but both confirmed there were no injuries. A spokesperson from Tesco told Metro.co.uk: ‘Our Dunfermline Express is currently closed due to a vehicle making impact with the store. ‘No injuries have been reported, and we will support local police with their enquiries. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused.’ A Police Scotland spokesperson added: ‘Officers attended at Aberdour Road in Dunfermline at around 7pm on Thursday following a crash involving one vehicle.’ Locals reacted with quips on Facebook upon hearing the news. ‘New drive-thru?’ wrote Kevin Smith. ‘Just noticed club card prices and went for it full throttle’, said Stephen Philbin. James McAspurn added: ‘Luckily it wasn’t at the cheese fridge or there would be debrie everyhwere.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
