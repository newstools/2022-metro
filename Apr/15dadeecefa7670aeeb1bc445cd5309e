A 16-year-old boy died when two of his friends shot him while they fooled around with a gun and body armour. Christopher Broad, 16, was killed when he took it in turns with Joshua Vining, 17, to wear the bulletproof vest and fire the gun at one another on April 3. Vining was charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child and another friend, Colton Whitler, 17, was charged with lying to police about who fired the shots. The incident in Belleview, Florida, was recorded by Evan Vowell, 18, who handed the footage over to police as evidence. Vining showed Christopher and the other two teenagers the gun and a bulletproof vest before asking if they had ‘ever seen anyone get shot with a bulletproof vest on’. Christopher then fired a single shot at Vining while he wore the vest. They then swapped roles and Vining shot the gun once and then four more times in quick succession. Witness Joe Vanhouten woke up to gunshots. He said: ‘I walked out past my truck, and I saw a teenaged boy come out of the trailer next door screaming all hysterical. ‘What I know of him, I mean, I guess you’d say a typical teenager.’ Vanhouten said. ‘I know they don’t really realize the consequences of some of the stuff they do.’  The two teens are being charged as adults in Broad’s death. Both were released from jail on bond. In Florida, aggravated manslaughter of a child with a firearm can carry a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.
