There are all kinds of bob cuts trending at the moment, from refined to choppy. This one, the bottleneck bob, is a more relaxed take on the cut, with layers and fringing. It’s low maintenance and doesn’t need much styling, making it perfect for someone who wants to simply wash and go. Ricky Walters, founder of hair salon Studio 64, says: ‘With the hotter weather on its way, blow dries on long hair don’t last as long. ‘Clients want a feminine cool cut for summer that’s far from mumsy and keeps their personality and edge firmly in place. ‘This bob such an easy look to grow back out for winter so it’s a no brainer and one of my personal favourites this year.’ Ricky describes the cut as ‘a heavy, blunt bob with maximum attitude’. He tells Metro.co.uk: ‘Keep the ends full and chunky, while going a little longer in lengths than other bobs. ‘This is the rock star of the bob world – understated yet full of impact. ‘This look is super low maintenance, but as it grows out can start to become a little triangular in shape, so simply pop back into your salon for a tidy up or add layers and grow the hair out.’ Ricky recommends going armed with pictures to a hairdresser, just to ensure you’re both on the same page. ‘This avoids any communication breakdowns between client and hairdresser,’ he says. As for styling, the bottleneck bob looks best when hair is shiny. Ricky says: ‘I recommend using Salon 64 Viva La Shine Shampoo and Conditioner. ‘Using charcoal to remove impurities within the hair and the oil found in coffee beans to hydrate a moisturise the hair, these products were designed for this look in mind.’ Do you have a story to share?
