Neil Robertson knocked in a 147 break during his World Snooker Championship second round match against Jack Lisowski on Monday night, just the 12th maximum ever to be made at the Crucible. It was the Australian’s first maximum at the home of the World Championship as he became the eighth player to manage perfection at the Sheffield theatre. The break came in the 19th frame of the match, with Robertson on the comeback trail after conceding a lead in the second session and Lisowski winning the first of Monday evening. The Thunder from Down Under had claimed a tight 18th frame before rolling in the max to go within one frame of Jackpot. His concentration was clearly not bothered by the amazing feat as he then returned to the table to win the next and go in at the mid-session interval at 10-10. The first Crucible maximum came back in 1983 when Cliff Thorburn made history, while Jimmy White, Stephen Hendry, Ronnie O’Sullivan, Mark Williams, Ali Carter and John Higgins have all made them on the hallowed Sheffield turf. Robertson gets £47,500 for his efforts, unless another player hits a max before the end of the tournament. There is a £40,000 bonus for the 147 at the Crucible, while he shares the £15,000 prize which Graeme Dott looked set to win when he made a max in the qualifiers. Robertson takes his tally to five maximums over his career, only behind Ronnie O’Sullivan (15), John Higgins (12), Stephen Hendry (11), Stuart Bingham (9) and Ding Junhui, Shaun Murphy and Judd Trump all on six.
