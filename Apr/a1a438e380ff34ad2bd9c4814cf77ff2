A hungry puppy who took a shine to her owner’s engagement ring was found out by an X-ray. Elayna Rattenbury, 38, feared she had lost her diamond and sapphire ring after it disappeared from her bedside table. And Labrador Stevie, who had just demolished a box of tissues in the room, was the prime suspect. ‘It was a heart-stopping moment,’ said legal director Elayna, of Worcester. ‘I looked at Stevie and thought, “She hasn’t, surely she hasn’t?” But oh yes, she had.’ She took the seven-month-old dog to Brentknoll Veterinary Centre and an X-ray soon got to the bottom of it. ‘There was a real sense of relief in knowing that at least the ring was not lost,’ she said. ‘The problem now was retrieving it from Stevie’s tummy. The vets felt after some investigation that the ring was too far down. ‘So, the only solution was to allow nature to take its course and let the ring pass through Stevie and out the other end. ‘I took her home and for the next four days I was rooting through her poo trying to find it.’ Elayna added: ‘My husband Dave bought a metal detector to try to find it and then, thankfully, on day four, it finally appeared. It certainly needed a good soaking and scrubbing.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
