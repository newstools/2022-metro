A 46-year-old British man is among four people who have gone missing after a diving trip in Malaysia. A 14-year-old Dutch boy, an 18-year-old French woman and a 35-year-old Norwegian woman are also among the group. The hunt for the European quartet began at around 2.45pm local time (7.45am British time) off the southeastern coast of Malaysia. Boats from the coastguard, the police and the fisheries department are involved in the search, senior coastguard official Nurul Hizam Zakaria said in a statement. The group are said to have been scuba diving roughly ten miles off a beach on the small island of Pulau Tokong Sanggol in Mersing. The area is popular with foreign and domestic visitors, with resorts dotted along the coast and on nearby islands. The group were reported missing at around 2.30pm, 15 minutes before the search began, the Malaysian coastguard search and rescue team said. An investigation was said to be ongoing this afternoon. Diving accidents, while rare, do occasionally take place in Malaysia. A British tourist died when she was struck by a passing boat’s propeller while diving off resort islands in the South China Sea in 2013. The tropical southeast Asian nation’s white-sand beaches and rainforests have long made it a desirable destination, but the tourism industry there was hit hard by the Covid crisis. The country’s borders reopened to foreign tourists last week after a two-year closure. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
