A stunning three-bedroom glass house has gone up for grabs in London for a whopping £2 million – but it’s a bit of a tight squeeze inside. Even though the house is exceptionally slender, the property boasts three bedrooms, three bathrooms, six storeys and 2,111 sq ft of space – including an impressive private lift which zips you around to each floor. The amazing home – situated in Golden Lane, close to the Barbican in Clerkenwell – was designed in 2004 by Joe Hagen, who won a RIBA future house award thanks to its impressive architecture. As you enter the home on the ground floor, you come into the entrance hall, which also comes with a utility room, lift and stairs. Downstairs, the basement is home to one of the bedrooms and a bathroom. On the first floor you have the second bedroom, bathroom, stairs and lift -– with the second floor having the third bedroom and a similar layout. The exceptional kitchen can be found on the third floor, which comes with a Corian worktop and sensor lighting, enough room for a dining table and plenty of storage. On the fourth floor you can find the reception room, which has a surprisingly good-sized space for gatherings and chilled nights enjoying the city views. Reaching the fifth floor, either by stair or lift, there is a study featuring a library-style bookcase. The property even comes with a roof terrace with stunning views of London. The smart home also benefits from control4 wireless controls for lights, TV and music, an intercom with video, limestone underfloor heating and thermostats throughout the building. It is currently on the market with Foxtons for £2 million. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
