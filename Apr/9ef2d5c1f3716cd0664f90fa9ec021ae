A British former care worker who travelled to Ukraine to fight has been pictured for the first time since being captured by Russian forces. Aiden Aslin’s photo was shared on a pro-Donetsk People’s Republic Telegram account. The fighter from Newark, Nottinghamshire, was said to have surrendered after running out of food and ammunition in the besieged city of Mariupol. Mr Aslin, 28, moved to Ukraine in 2018 after falling in love with a woman from Mykolaiv, who is now his fiancée. The dual-national was serving with the 39th Brigade Ukrainian Marines when he was captured. He has previously fought alongside Kurdish armed units against ISIS in Syria between 2015 and 2016. Images show Mr Aslin with cuts on his face and his wrists in handcuffs. It is not known where he is being held or what authorities have planned for him next. But it is likely he will be used for propaganda purposes or as a political pawn by Vladimir Putin’s regime. He could eventually be released as part of a prisoner exchange. Speaking to a friend in the UK just before he and his unit were captured, he said: ‘It’s been 48 days. We tried our best to defend Mariupol but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian forces. ‘We have no food and no ammunition. It’s been a pleasure everyone, I hope this war ends soon.’ This is a breaking news story – more to follow. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
