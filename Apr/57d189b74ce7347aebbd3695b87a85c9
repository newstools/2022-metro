Boris Johnson ignored the scandal engulfing his premiership with his first tweet since being fined by police. The Prime Minister instead referred to the war in Ukraine, perhaps suggesting he has no intension of resigning despite widespread calls for him to do so. Mr Johnson, his Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and his wife, Carrie, have all been reprimanded by the Metropolitan Police over the partygate scandal. The PM’s fine – which could be the first of a number – was handed out in relation to an event on his birthday when he was ‘ambushed with cake’. But he ignored the explosive revelations this afternoon by tweeting instead: ‘I’ve just spoken to (USA President Joe Biden) and updated him on my meeting with (Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky) in Kyiv this weekend. ‘Our joint focus remains on supporting President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people in their fight for freedom. ‘Putin’s barbaric venture cannot be allowed to succeed.’ Meanwhile, there is yet to be any notable shows of support from fellow cabinet ministers this evening, with Foreign Secretary Liz Truss also tweeting about Ukraine. Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer, Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon and a number of other high-profile figures have all called for the PM to resign.
