Rio Ferdinand has urged Manchester United fans to get behind Erik ten Hag and give him sufficient time as he looks to bring success back to Old Trafford. Ten Hag was unveiled as United’s next manager on Thursday, with the current Ajax boss signing a three-year deal with the Premier League club. The 52-year-old will join Manchester United at the end of the season having enjoyed five successful years at Ajax, winning two Eredivisie titles – they could win a third this term – and two Dutch cups. United have largely struggled since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 – failing to add to their impressive trophy cabinet since 2017 – and are only sixth in the Premier League this season, having been thrashed 4-0 by Liverpool earlier in the week. Reacting to Ten Hag’s appointment, Ferdinand said on the Vibe with Five YouTube channel: ‘Am I happy? Yes, I’m happy it’s done, I’m happy it’s announced and that we’ve got some direction now. ‘He knows how to win, albeit in Holland. Everything I’ve being hearing about him are really positive. ‘What he needs is time, guys. Give this guy time to go out there and get through a good couple of transfer windows. ‘He needs to reshape the squad and create a Ten Hag squad to get United back to winning things or at least challenging for the Premier League and Champions League.’ Ten Hag, meanwhile, says he is ‘absolutely determined’ to deliver success at Manchester United following a difficult period for the club. ‘It is a great honour to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead,’ Ten Hag said. ‘I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
