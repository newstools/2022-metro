Former world darts champion Ted Hankey has admitted sexually assaulting a woman. The 54-year-old appeared at Warrington Magistrates’ Court on Thursday. He spoke to confirm his name, age and address and pleaded guilty to the charge. The court heard he was charged with intentionally touching a woman over the age of 16 on September 10 last year. Jonathan Wilkinson, prosecuting, said the victim was under 18. District Judge Nicholas Sanders said the case would be sent to Chester Crown Court, where Hankey will be sentenced on May 12. He told Hankey he would become subject to notification requirements and should report to a local police station as he granted him conditional bail. The hearing lasted about 10 minutes and the charge relates to an incident in Crewe, Cheshire. Hankey, of Wendover Grove, Berry Hill, Stoke-on-Trent, arrived at court with a black snood pulled up to cover the lower half of his face. He was released on bail after initially being charged by Cheshire Constabulary last month. The authority subsequently released a statement, which read: ‘The Crown Prosecution Service has authorised Cheshire Constabulary to charge Edward Hankey with the sexual assault of a woman. ‘The CPS made the decision to charge the 54-year-old after reviewing a file of evidence from Cheshire Constabulary.’ Hankey, whose nsickname is The Count, is a two-time BDO world professional darts champion. He first qualified for the BDO world championship in 1998 and went on to win the event in 2000 and 2009. In December it was announced that Hankey was withdrawing from the world seniors darts championship, held in February.
