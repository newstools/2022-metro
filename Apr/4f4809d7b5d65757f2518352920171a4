Thierry Henry has seemingly given his blessing to Arsenal’s pursuit of Gabriel Jesus by praising his natural goalscoring instinct as a No.9. Arsenal have been linked with a move for the Manchester City forward given their need to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, while Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah are out of contract in the summer. Given City look to sign Erling Haaland in the summer and Jesus’ lack of regular starts this season, Arsenal could offer him a way out when the transfer window opens. Arsenal legend Henry is big fan of the Brazlian’s talents who boasts five goals in his last two starts. ‘What he can give offensively to the team,’ Henry said on CBS Sports. ‘We saw that he scored four goals at the weekend [against Watford]. When he is in the box, he’s one of the three that is playing, or since [Sergio] Aguero left, he has that nine instinct. He has what the number nine would smell. ‘What I like with him is that when he puts pressure, whether it’s on the left, on the right or in the middle, he doesn’t have a problem to defend in them situations by coming back and helping his team.’ After scoring four goals against Watford at the weekend, Jesus was asked about a potential move to the Emirates. ‘Not time to think about this,’ he replied. ‘You expect me to say this and it’s true. Not time to think about this, now is the best moment of the season.’ Jesus is under contract with City until the summer of 2023 and following his Watford heroics Guardiola was coy about what the future holds for the 25-year-old. ‘Gabriel (Jesus) is our player. I don’t know what is going to happen, but he is a Manchester City player,’ he said.
