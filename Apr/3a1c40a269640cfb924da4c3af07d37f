In what appears to be a nod to her sister Pippa, Kate Middleton wore a fern-shaped diamond brooch to the Anzac Day service at Westminster Abbey yesterday. Eagle-eyed royal fans have noticed the brooch, in either a platinum or white gold metal and studded with multiple gems, bears a striking similarity to the tiara Pippa wore to her wedding to James Matthews. It’s thought that the brooch was made by Chelsea-based jeweller Robinson Pelham, who made Pippa’s diamond maidenhair fern tiara. It wouldn’t be the first time that this particular designer has worked with the Middleton family. Pippa and Kate’s parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, had the designer make a pair of earrings for Pippa to wear to Kate’s wedding to Prince William. Pippa, 38, then went on to wear them to her own wedding in 2017. Pippa and James’s marriage ceremony took place at St Mark’s Church in Englefield – with Pippa wearing a long, white lace gown with short sleeves and an elegant high neckline. For the event yesterday, the Duchess of Cambridge, 40, affixed the brooch to a white Alexander McQueen coat dress. She also wore Princess Diana’s Collingwood drop earrings, a matching headband by milliner Jane Taylor and a red paper poppy. The Duchess completed her Anzac Day look with black heels and carried a matching black bag to the service. She also carried a pair of white Cornelia James gloves. Do you have a story to share?
