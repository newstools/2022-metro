Picture it now: you’re sunning yourself on the poolside against the glittering backdrop of the Atlantic ocean, breathtaking volcanic landscape behind you, on an island escape like no other. If that sounds like just the ticket, then you’ll want to get your hands (and your Insta account) on our unmissable prize. Metro’s must-read travel newsletter, The Getaway, has teamed up with Jet2holidays to offer one subscriber the chance to win a seven-night luxury escape to the Portuguese island of Madeira, with return flights included. You and a guest will be staying at the five-star VidaMar Resort Hotel, which sits on the coastal edge of Madeira’s pretty cobblestoned capital of Funchal, and comes complete with three saltwater infinity pools and an oceanfront spa. The included half-board plan also lets you raid the delights of VidaMar’s five restaurants. From there you have plenty of time to hike Madeira’s pretty levadas (a network of footpaths alongside its canals and other waterways), swim in a lava rock pool and ride its mountain cable cars. Activities such as coasteering, diving and paragliding are plentiful if you want to up the adrenaline, just check out the Madeira Tourist Board website and get planning. So, what are you waiting for? To be in with a chance of winning, sign up to Metro’s travel newsletter The Getaway and register your details at metro.co.uk/getawaycomp. Terms and conditions apply. Good luck!
