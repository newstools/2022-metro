Wayne Rooney delivered a rousing speech to Derby County supporters outside the club’s training ground following their relegation from the Championship on Monday. Derby’s demotion to League One was confirmed following a late defeat to QPR at Loftus Road. Rooney’s side have been battling a 21-point deduction for the majority of the season and would’ve remained in the Championship had they not been hit with the penalty for going into administration back in September. Rooney and Derby’s players were greeted by supporters at the club’s Moor Farm training ground following the defeat to QPR on Monday evening, and the former Manchester United captain took the opportunity to promise fans that the club will make a swift return to the Championship. ‘We’re grateful for the support that you have shown us all season,’ Rooney told supporters. ‘It’s been f****** tough, it’s been hard, difficult moments for us and for you especially. ‘It’s been very tough but we’ve tried our best and we did everything we can. ‘It’s unfortunate we’ve been relegated but now we’ll plan to make sure this football club comes back.’ In a separate interview, Rooney also hit out at Derby’s former owner Mel Morris. ‘Hopefully he doesn’t have a good night’s sleep tonight and that plays on his mind,’ Rooney told BBC Radio Derby. ‘I think he needs to have a think about it. ‘Where the club’s been left, it was a complete mess. I know Mel Morris is a big Derby fan, so I’m sure he’s sat at home tonight disappointed. ‘We are disappointed as we’ve done everything we can to try and not let this happen and worked extremely hard.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
