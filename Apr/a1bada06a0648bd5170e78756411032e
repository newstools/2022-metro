A man has died after a car ploughed into the Russian embassy in Bucharest. The driver was killed when the vehicle burst into flames after smashing into the gates of the compound. It’s unclear what the motive behind the incident in the Romanian capital was but it comes widespread revulsion at the treatment of civilians in Ukraine. The saloon car rammed into the gate at about 6am but did not enter the embassy grounds, the police said. Video showed the car engulfed in flames as security personnel ran through the area. Firefighters put the blaze out but the driver – who has not been formally identified – died at the scene. The Russian embassy told the Associated Press that it could not provide any futher details. Romania, which shares a long land border with Ukraine, has taken in more than 600,000 refugees since Russia invaded its neighbour. There have been rolling protests outside the embassy since the invasion began on February 24. The incident comes a day after the Romanian government expelled 10 Russian diplomats from the country. Bucharest joined other European Union nations in forcing representatives of the Russian government to leave. Romania’s foreign ministry said the actions of 10 embassy workers ‘contravene the provisions of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relationships’. Volodymyr Zelensky addressed Romania’s parliament on Monday and labelled the murders of civilians in the town of Bucha a war crime and called for tougher sanctions against Russia. Before the Ukrainian leader spoke, Romania’s president of the Chamber of Deputies, Marcel Ciolacu, said the ‘horrible images’ that emerged after Russian troops withdrew from Bucha have ‘overwhelmed and revolted us all’.
