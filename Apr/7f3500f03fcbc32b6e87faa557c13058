Chris Brown is a dad-of-three, the singer has confirmed. The 32-year-old musician shares his baby girl with Diamond Brown, while he also fathers daughter Royalty, seven, and son Aeko Catori, two. He shares Royalty with Nia Guzman and Aeko with Ammika Harris. The No Guidance hitmaker welcomed daughter Lovely Symphani Brown in January, and he has posted a photo of her for the first time. However, Diamond initially announced the news of Lovely’s birth on January 7, via Instagram. Taking to her page earlier today, she shared an adorable snap of baby Lovely wearing the coolest red and blue Gucci one-piece, complete with matching headband. Lovely wore a beaming smile on her face, while her mum captioned the pic: ‘I gave you life, but really, you gave me mine. ❤️ HAPPY 3 months my little firecracker!’ Fans were obsessed with the photo and could not cope with how cute the tot is. ‘She’s growing up too fast 😢’ one wrote. ‘Definitely starting to look like her daddy 😍’ commented another. Chris then reposted the image to his Instagram story with a series of red heart emoji. While this is Lovely’s debut on his Insta – which boasts 106million followers – he regularly shares pictures and videos of his other two children. Most recently, the American artist posted a vid of  Aeko correctly identifying several of animal toys. Chris was in a highly-publicised relationship with the mother of his second child, Ammika Harris, and he  reportedly started seeing Diamond on-and-off three years ago. However, despite being photographed together on several occasions and liking each other’s posts, neither Chris nor Diamond has confirmed or denied whether they were or are in a relationship. Elsewhere, Chris is currently ‘taking legal action’ against a woman who accused him of rape. The singer denies drugging and sexually assaulting her. Got a story?
