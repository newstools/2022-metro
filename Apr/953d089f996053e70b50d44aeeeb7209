The stunt aircraft crumpled on impact after it struck a building in Oxfordshire earlier today. Emergency services raced to the scene shortly after noon, Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said. Further injuries were avoided because the residential building was unoccupied at the time. An eye witness said they saw the pilot bail out before the aircraft smashed into the wall. George Parker, who lives just a few hundred yards from the crash scene at the former United States Air Force base, said: ‘I was amazed to see the parachute and then realised that the plane was coming down at a 45 degree angle and was going to crash. ‘I saw the pilot come down in a nearby field as the plane smashed into a block of new build flats. Fortunately no-one has yet moved into them.’ The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it has launched an investigation and inspectors have begun searches at the scene.
