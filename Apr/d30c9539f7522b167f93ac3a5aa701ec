A memorial bench was badly damaged on the 40th anniversary of the Falklands War in a ‘disgusting’ act of vandalism. While Britain honoured the lives of hundreds of fallen heroes in the conflict with Argentina, a group of people decided to have a BBQ on one of four benches at the War Memorial Village in Derby. Photographs show the burnt object in Shelton Lock and a pile of ash on the ground underneath. A spokesperson for the War Memorial Village Derby, which provide a home for injured and disabled ex-service personnel and their families, confirmed the news on Facebook. ‘Really disappointed that somebody decided to have a BBQ on one of our memorial benches’, they wrote, sharing photos of two workers cleaning up the bench. ‘At first glance it looked at though there was no permanent damage. After removing the ash it became clear the resin floor has been burnt. ‘Sadly, melted red and green plastic was also found suggesting poppy wreaths were burnt.’ They added the repair may take some time as they are still unsure about the costs, the Derby Telegraph reported. Furious residents took to social media to appeal for CCTV footage of the crime, also asking any witnesses to come forward. Local Gary Panter said this was a ‘disgraceful, disgusting and disrespectful’ and added: ‘People these days have no respect. Hope these people are caught and made to pay for the damage they have caused.’ Karen Daykin also wrote: ‘Very disappointing and especially on the 40th Anniversary of the Falklands War, although I doubt they even know nor care.’ Margaret Woodbridge responded: ‘Absolutely awful and so disrespectful, lets hope some of the houses nearby have CCTV that may have picked something up.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
