This incredible paramotor pilot effortlessly glides over a stunning 4,000-year-old temple complex in Egypt. Brazilian Yanis Terzis, 35, flew over structures such as temples, obelisks and chapels, in the monumental Karnak Temple Complex in Luxor, Egypt. His paramotor has a regular paraglide set up, but is fitted with a large fan that propels him forward and keeps him airborne. Using a GoPro attached to his head, Yanis is able to record videos of the phenomenal sites from his unique point of view, which he shares with his fans all over the world. Yannis, a psychiatric administrator from Campinas, Brazil, is a paramotor-pro and often travels around the world to soar over and film stunning sites. He filmed this trip in October 2021.
