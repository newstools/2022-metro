Manchester United have been given the green light to sign Ajax winger Antony, with Erik ten Hag keen to take the midfielder with him from Amsterdam to Old Trafford. The Red Devils have agreed personal terms with ten Hag for the Dutchman to take charge at the Theatre of Dreams this summer. The Ajax boss is set to sign an initial three-year deal with United but the delay over an agreement was in part down to Ten Hag’s insistence that he’s given control over the club’s recruitment. He has already assessed United’s squad in terms of who needs to go and what areas they need to strengthen, and he’s identified the right wing as an area of priority. Antony, 22, has established himself as a Brazil international since joining Ajax and the Sun say that the Dutch giants will accept a fee of around £50m to let him go this summer. United have a good relationship with Ajax, having dealt with them for Daley Blind and Donny van de Beek in recent years. Ten Hag wants to sign players that are accustomed to his style of play and Antony would fill a problem position that has caused United a headache for the last few years. Jadon Sancho was signed to play on the right flank but he’s mainly been used from the left, where Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard all prefer to operate. Ten hag feels United should be quick to go for Antony, as his value could skyrocket by the time the World Cup comes around in December.
