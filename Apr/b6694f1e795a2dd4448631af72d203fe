Living under a flight path can have its annoyances, especially at night when the rumblings of planes can disturb sleep. One Dublin resident has taken such umbrage with his nearest airport that he’s made thousands of objections – 12,272 to be exact. The unknown person is responsible for 90% of all noise complaints about planes at the airport. On average, the individual logged 34 cases a day in 2021. The Irish Independent reports that the person lives in Ongar, a suburb on the outskirts of Dublin 12 miles from the airport. The resident is said to be responsible for a ‘dramatic increase’ in complaints filed with the airport since 2019. Previously, Dublin Airport received around 1,500 noise complaints per year. But in 2021, their grand total came to 13,569. The total number would have just been a more humble 1,296 if cases raised by the serial complainer were excluded. The previous year, in 2020, the same individual made 6,000 complaints. He or she will have needed to have repeatedly called a specific airport phone line, or gone online to log each incident. The complaint form on Dublin Airport’s website has 13 different lines to fill in, including a description of the noise and dates. In the first three months of this year, the mystery moaner made 5,276 complaints – averaging out at 49 per day. When contacted by the Irish Independent, Dublin Airport declined to comment on the figures. But a spokesperson did take the opportunity to say operators were keen to ‘work with communities’ to find solutions. Typically, those in Dublin who take issue with noise near the airport live in flight path areas such as Portmarnock, Swords, the Ward and St Margaret’s.
