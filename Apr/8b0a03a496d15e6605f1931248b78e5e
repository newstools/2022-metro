Manchester United are willing to listen to offers for five first-team players this summer after the club told Erik ten Hag he can top up his transfer budget through player sales. The Dutchman signed a three-year deal with the Red Devils last week and he has his work cut out at Old Trafford, with the likes of Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Edinson Cavani, Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard all set to leave the club on free transfers when their contracts expire. Ten Hag has already identified weak spots in the squad and he wants to sign a centre-back, a right-back, at least one central midfielder and a striker to bolster the squad. But ESPN report that United have given the Dutchman a budget of between £100m-£150m, which would not cover the additions he wants to make. It’s therefore claimed that the Dutchman is willing to part with five players in order to top-up his transfer budget, with United’s board willing to release all additional funds from player sales. United will therefore listen to offers for Eric Bailly, Phil Jones, Anthony Martial, Alex Telles and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, with Ten Hag open to letting them all leave the club. United signed Martial for an initial £36m, while Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s move from Crystal Palace could rise to £50m depending on clauses in his deal. Those departures would be the two most controversial from the group, but Bailly, Jones and Telles are all keen to play first-team football.
