Ever wanted to add a little Disney magic into your home? Well, now you can. Disney has announced a new homeware collection that includes bedding, wallpaper, accessories and more. The home and interiors brand, called Disney Home, looks to ‘bring the magic of Disney to everyday living’, with product lines that will evolve to ‘complement every interior style and budget.’ The designs have been influenced by Disney stories – including Mickey and Minnie, Disney Classics, Star Wars and Marvel – and can be purchased from a range of retailers across UK and Europe from today, including B&M, Ruggable and Selfridges.
