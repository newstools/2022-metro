Roy Keane admits he’s unsurprised that Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger turned down the chance to join Manchester United this summer. Thomas Tuchel confirmed last weekend that the Germany international has decided to leave Chelsea when his contract expires at the end of the season. The 29-year-old has been a key part of Tuchel’s success at Chelsea and has not been short of offers ahead of the summer transfer window. Real Madrid look set to win the race for his signature, but it’s understood that United also made an approach for the Chelsea defender. But Keane believes United had little chance of winning the race with Madrid for Rudiger. Asked how big of a loss Rudiger will be for Chelsea, Keane told Sky Sports: ‘Huge loss, huge loss, obviously for what he does on the football pitch. ‘He’s a big character, very, very good player of course. ‘But I reckon what he brings to the dressing room and on the training ground day in, day out, he’s going to be a big loss to them. He’s been outstanding this season, the fact his contract’s been up. ‘Obviously that’s probably motivated him as well to get a better deal, it’s not worked out at Chelsea for obvious reasons with sanctions etc. ‘But he’s got a great move and I have no doubt about him, he’ll finish the season strongly, he just seems that type of character.’ Asked if he felt United should have made a move for Rudiger, Keane replied: ‘I guess they probably did try to approach him. ‘I think they have done but he’s thought, ‘no, I want to win some trophies’.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
