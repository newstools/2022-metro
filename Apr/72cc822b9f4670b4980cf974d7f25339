A couple have denied carrying out a year-long campaign of harassment against their neighbours of four decades. Sandra Durdin, 58, and Trever Dempsey, 63 – who have since separated – got into a row with Joanne Shreeves at the height of the pandemic from June 2020 to August last year. They allegedly flooded her alleyway, put barbed wire onto garden fencing, sprayed a hose at her home and erected dolls and clowns on the dividing fence. Durdin is alleged to have called her neighbour an ‘ugly whore’ and the couple parked on Joanne’s drive at their home in Chingford, east London. They had been due to stand trial at Stratford Magistrates’ Court but Durdin has Covid so the case was adjourned until May 3. Durdin further denies criminal damage after a CCTV camera worth £1,350 belonging to Joanne was destroyed. Prosecutor Lucy McGarr said the allegations included ‘putting up clowns and dolls on [their neighbour’s] fence’ and ‘spraying hose water onto their house’. The case was described as ‘messy to say the least’. District Judge Jane McIvor directed the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to decide ‘whether it is in the public interest to continue’ with proceedings. Dempsey, who sat in the dock wearing a dark suit, spoke to confirm his details and tell the court he has now separated from Durdin. A previous hearing was told the defendants, who have both been bailed, have now moved to Ramsgate. They will not be required to attend the review on May 3.
