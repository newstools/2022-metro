Thomas Tuchel admitted Timo Werner and Kai Havertz failed to ‘reach their peak’ in Chelsea’s 1-1 draw with Manchester United. Chelsea left Old Trafford with a point after Cristiano Ronaldo cancelled out Marcos Alonso’s opener but the visitors had plenty of chances to win the game. Havertz and Werner led the line for the Blues with Romelu Lukaku on the bench but failed to take their chances as David de Gea made a string of saves. A frustrated Tuchel wanted more from his strikers and claimed players ‘lacked determination’ in the box. ‘One team deserved to win and that was us. We didn’t take it,’ he said. ‘It was a very, very good performance but we were not decisive enough. We lacked a bit of determination in the box to win the game. ‘It sometimes happens. It’s on us to learn from it. You need to be clinical to get the reward. We have to live with a point but it’s not a fair result. ‘We worked so hard to get the lead and suddenly the opponent gets one free shot and scores. ‘Reece James played a very good match and Mason Mount unlucky with his decisions.’ Discussing his decision to take off Havertz and Werner, he added: ‘We had a lot of chances. ‘I think the two did not reach their peak performance today and if they did we were now the winners. ‘That’s it but no need to point the fingers we had enough chances to score today.’ MORE : Roy Keane blasts Marcus Rashford for smiling in warm-up before Manchester United vs Chelsea MORE : Roy Keane mocks Man Utd over their push to sign Chelsea’s Antonio Rudiger For more stories like this, check our sport page.
