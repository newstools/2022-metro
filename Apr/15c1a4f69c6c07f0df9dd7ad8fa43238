Colin the Caterpillar has undergone metamorphosis at M&S. However, he’s not turned into a beautiful butterfly, but a refreshing beverage instead. The supermarket has unveiled a new Colin the Caterpillar frappe for summer. In terms of ingredients, this indulgent blended drink comes with whipped cream as well as chocolate sauce and is finished with sprinkles and a Colin the Caterpillar face. At £3.50, the drink is available in M&S stores now and has been brought out as part of a new summer range – along with two other beverages. So the signature taste of Colin can now be enjoyed on-the-go or sitting in the sunshine. The other refreshments new to M&S include a limited edition strawberry and cream shortbread frappe and a minty mango smoothie – priced at £3.50 and £3.25, respectively. The launch of the quintessentially British strawberry and cream beverage is thought to tie in well to the Queen’s upcoming Jubilee. M&S product developer Claire Hodgson, who is behind the new range, says: ‘This summer I wanted to introduce some sensational drinks for our customers to get excited for, and plaster all over their Instagrams – because they are just so good. ‘This includes my personal favourite, a strawberry and cream (afternoon tea-inspired) Scottish shortbread frappe. It is unbelievably delicious and launching just in time for customers to enjoy in the run up to the Platinum Jubilee.’ Elsewhere in the world novelty cakes, Morrisons is selling a Corgi cake, named Clarence, for the royal celebration.
