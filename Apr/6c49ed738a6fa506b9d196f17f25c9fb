Love a good bath bomb? Love free things? If you tick off yes to both, you’re in for a treat. Lush is doing a massive giveaway of 100,000 free bath bombs next week, in honour of World Bath Bomb Day (yep, it’s a thing). If you head along to your nearest Lush shop on Wednesday April 27 and chat to a member of staff, you’ll be able to pick out your ideal bath bomb match. It’s only while stocks last, though, so you’ll want to be quick. Perhaps a Lush trip is on order on your lunch break, or you could pop in before work? The Lush team also say they’ll be handing out free bath bombs in ‘public places where stress levels might be high’, such as Covent Garden and London Bridge. There’s no catch, but we will warn you: along with celebrating World Bath Bomb Day, this offer is to promote the brand’s Book A Bath service, so be prepared for some chat about that. Book A Bath is pretty much what it sounds like – offered in Lush’s spa locations in Bath, Oxford Street, and Liverpool, you get to have a luxurious bath complete with a bath bomb, a fresh face mask, and cooling eye pads. It costs £40 for a 15-minute consultation and a 30-minute bathing experience. The different locations offer specific bathing experiences – if you go to the Oxford Street or Bath stores, you’ll enjoy one inspired by The Lakes (all nature and florals), while in Liverpool the treat is themed around the Diamond Dust bath bomb (for ‘main character energy’, apparently). If you fancy either, you’ll need to book in with the Lush Spa directly. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
