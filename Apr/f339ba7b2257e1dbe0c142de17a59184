Britain’s Got Talent fans have spotted that impressionist act Suzi Wild is already working in comedy, despite not revealing this during her introduction. Suzi wowed the panel on Saturday night, being sent straight through by all four judges. Her act saw her impersonate names such as Janet Street-Porter, Kirsty Allsopp and Lorraine Kelly – leaving the audience in hysterics. She left Amanda Holden cracking up after her skit of Lorraine saying Piers Morgan needed ‘gaffer tape for the mouth and a bag for the head’ as his two accessories to his signature suit. But some of those watching at home pointed out that Suzi isn’t a novice on the circuit, and is already well-known in the industry. ‘Is this the famous impressionist? #BGT #BritainsGotTalent,’ a viewer asked on Twitter. Someone else commented: ‘Simon knows all of the people auditioning, not surprised #BGT.’ Another user shared a picture of a poster with a string of her tour dates, alongside the caption: ‘Not an office worker. #BGT.’ But many fans were loving the impersonator, with one writing on the social media platform: ‘Suzi Wild is probably the best impressionist I’ve seen on BGT in years. Loved her 👏🏼 #BGT #BritainsGotTalent.’ A viewer wrote: ‘I was quite impressed 🙂 I wouldn’t have been against a #goldenbuzzer for Suzi! #BGT #BritainsGotTalent.’ ‘Wow. Suzi was incredible. I love her #BGT #BritainsGotTalent,’ someone added. Fans found that Suzi even has a comedy CV online, which details her past experience in the sector. It reads: ‘Suzi Wild is a UK based comedian and talented impressionist. Starting on the circuit in 2010 within a year she made the finals of Laughing Horse New Act of The Year and Semi-Finals ‘So You Think you’re Funny’.” Past winners of So You Think You’re Funny include Aisling Bea, Dylan Moran, Lee Mack, Peter Kay and David O’Doherty. It goes on: ‘2013 saw her reach the finals of ‘U.T.C One To Watch’ competition. Suzi has been scouted by TV production companies and filmed sizzle reels for major TV channels ITV2, ITV (12 Yard ) and Victory Television (part of Sony). ‘She has hosted a radio show The Stand Up Sit Down on ONFM and voiced various comedy podcasts including the broadcast award-nominated Live From Kirrin Island. ‘Her Edinburgh Festival Show 2016 ‘Stand Against The Machine’ received amazing reviews and enjoyed full houses. ‘In August 2016 she signed with her first agent, the maverick Anita Elizabeth Holmes who’s international reach attracted Suzi to joining her roster.’ Multiple acts on the programme so far have already sparked cries of ‘fix’ claims from fans, including singer Loren Allred – whose song featured in The Greatest Showman – was given the golden buzzer last weekend.
