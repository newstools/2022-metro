Forget Colin or even Cuthbert the caterpillar, there’s a new novelty cake in town. Morrisons is bringing out a new baked good for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee – with a royal twist. The supermarket has unveiled a new Corgi-themed cake to celebrate 70 years of Queen Elizabeth II on the throne. Paying homage to Her Majesty’s love of the dog breed, the chocolate Swiss roll cake even comes with red, white and blue sprinkles. What’s more, the edible Corgi face will be topped with a Union Flag crown. The new sweet treat even has a name – following a competition on the Morrisons Facebook page. Meet Clarence the Corgi. Rachel Fish, a cake creator at Morrisons, commented: ‘We’ve created this special cake to pay tribute to the Queen, as the country celebrates her Platinum Jubilee this summer. ‘We had great fun coming up with names for the cake but think Clarence, as chosen by our customers, is a fitting tribute.’ Large enough to feed 12 people, the cake will be available in Morrisons stores from May 21 and is set to cost £6 – which is just £50p per slice. There’s no denying this cake will be the ideal centrepiece for any Platinum Jubilee celebration – if you can bring yourself to slice into that adorable face. Do you have a story to share?
