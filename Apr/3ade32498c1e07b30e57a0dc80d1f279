Francis Ngannou says there is a ’70 per cent chance’ Tyson Fury will be his next opponent, insisting he will not sign a new UFC contract without a fight against ‘The Gypsy King’ as part of the deal. Fury was joined by Ngannou in the ring following his knockout victory over Dillian Whyte at Wembley on Saturday with both confirming plans for a ‘hybrid’ fight in 2023. The UFC heavyweight champion Ngannou is in the midst of a contract dispute with the promotion with his current deal set to expire in December. The Cameroonian is keen to re-sign but insists that will be on the condition that UFC agree to let him fight Fury. ‘The Tyson Fury fight has to be part of the discussion,” Ngannou told The MMA Hour on Monday. ‘That’s not an option. It has to be part of the discussion because if that’s not part of the discussion, it will never be. ‘If I sign another contract now, basically the same model of the contract, I’m screwed. ‘That’s not happening ever. So we have to figure out a way to implement this into a contract.’ Ngannou defended his heavyweight title against Cyril Gane in January but the 35-year-old suggests his next fight could be against Fury. ‘Make it a hybrid fight, something that makes it a little uncomfortable for him as a boxer,’ Ngannou said. ‘Ideas like MMA gloves or fighting barefoot. I don’t know, we still have to figure this out. ‘I would say there’s a 70% chance my next opponent is Tyson Fury. On his side, I would say 90% against me.’ MORE : Deontay Wilder ‘weighing up his future’ after being urged to fight Oleksandr Usyk vs Anthony Joshua winner MORE : Eddie Hearn dismisses Tyson Fury retirement claim and says he cannot be considered one of the greatest of all time if he walks away For more stories like this, check our sport page.
