The UK is ramping up its military aid package to Ukraine by sending 120 armoured vehicles for the first time. Downing Street made the pledge following Boris Johnson’s unannounced visit to Kyiv to meet President Zelensky. The Prime Minister said he travelled to the Ukrainian capital as ‘a show of our unwavering support for the people of Ukraine’. As well as the armoured vehicles, in a significant stepping-up of UK military support, Mr Johnson said Britain would also be sending new anti-ship missile systems. Speaking after the visit, Boris Johnson said: ‘Ukraine has defied the odds and pushed back Russian forces from the gates of Kyiv, achieving the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century. ‘It is because of President Zelenskyy’s resolute leadership and the invincible heroism and courage of the Ukrainian people that Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted. ‘I made clear today that the United Kingdom stands unwaveringly with them in this ongoing fight, and we are in it for the long run. ‘We are stepping up our own military and economic support and convening a global alliance to bring this tragedy to an end, and ensure Ukraine survives and thrives as a free and sovereign nation.’ It comes the day after he announced a further £100 million worth of UK military assistance, including anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry and so-called ‘suicide drones’, which loiter over the battlefield before attacking their target.
