A charity shop was forced to close for the day when a selfish driver parked within inches of the front door. Volunteers at the British Red Cross in Kings Heath, south Birmingham, said the Ford Fiesta cost them at least £200 on Sunday. It’s believed the driver either deliberately left their car blocking the entrance as some strange protest, or was just through ‘silliness’. They called West Midlands Police but because the car eventually moved after six hours, no criminal action was taken. A note on the charity shop door told customers: ‘Sorry we are closed due to car blocking door.’ Staff also left a note for the driver on their windscreen: ‘Leaving your car here has resulted in us not being able to open our shop today.’ Another added: ‘A donation towards the shop’s loss of earnings would be greatly appreciated.’ Shop manager Alex Sharp told Birmingham Live: ‘The car was there for a good five or six hours. It was parked directly in front of the front door. ‘It could have parked literally anywhere else we would have been able to open. ‘There was nothing nearby. They must have chosen to park directly in front of the door. Who knows why, it’s just so silly. ‘We called the non-emergency police number. We got a log number and were told to call back if it was still there, but it has since moved.’ He added: ‘We’ve had people park in front of the windows before for like five or 10 minutes when we’re open, but this is a whole new thing. I don’t get it.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
