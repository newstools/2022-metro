Tiger Woods failed to hide his frustrations after missing the green during the opening round of the 2022 Masters on Friday. The 46-year-old was expected to be absent for the tournament after his car crash in February last year left him needing surgery following fractures to both the tibia and fibula in his right leg. Woods has already admitted that walking around Augusta will be the toughest part of competing in his first major since his crash. But the five-time Masters winner made an impressive start with pars in his first five holes before a birdie on the sixth. Woods bogeyed the eighth before losing his temper on the ninth after he was forced to approach the green with his ball in the pine straw. Woods managed to get a good connection but the ball hit the slope on the front of the green and rolled away, and microphones caught the 15-time major winner saying ‘f*** off’ after the shot. When asked before the tournament if he believes he can win at Augusta, Woods replied: ‘I do. ‘I can hit it just fine. I don’t have any qualms about what I can do from a golf standpoint. It’s now walking is the hard part. This is normally not an easy walk to begin with. ‘Now given the conditions that my leg is in, it gets even more difficult. You know, 72 holes is a long road. It’s going to be a tough challenge and a challenge that I’m up for. ‘I think that the fact that I was able to get myself here to this point is a success. Now that I am playing, everything is focused on: ‘How do I get myself into the position where I’m on that back nine on Sunday with a chance?’ Just like I did a few years ago.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
