Arsenal held a meeting with Eden Hazard’s representatives this week as they consider making an offer for the Real Madrid forward. French outlet Foot Mercato say the Gunners are thinking about bringing the former Chelsea star to the Emirates on loan this summer with an option to buy. Hazard established himself as a fans’ favourite at Stamford Bridge, scoring more than 100 goals in his seven-year spell in west London and helping the Blues win two Premier League titles and two Europa Leagues. Real Madrid spent more than £100m to sign Hazard in 2019 but the Belgian has struggled at the Bernabeu, scoring just six goals over the past three seasons. Due to fitness issues, Hazard has been absent for large periods of his stint at Real Madrid and could be tempted to leave the club in an attempt to revive his career. Chelsea have been linked with a move for their ex-player but that now appears unlikely, while Newcastle United are said to be interested in the 31-year-old following their Saudi-backed takeover. Reports in France say Arsenal are also monitoring Hazard’s situation and met with his representatives in the last week to discuss a possible deal. The plan, Foot Mercato say, would be to sign Hazard on loan and potentially securing his signature on a permanent deal at the end of the 2022-23 season, in the same vein as Martin Odegaard. Real Madrid are open to offloading Hazard but the report claims that the Belgium  international would prefer to stay put and intends, for the time being at least, to see out his contract in Spain. The situation could change in the summer, however, with Real Madrid looking to bolster Carlo Ancelotti’s squad and working on a sensational deal for Paris Saint-Germain superstar Kylian Mbappe.
