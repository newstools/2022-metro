Nine sex toys, six rounds of Viagra tablets, 81 wigs and 422 crutches were among items left behind on London’s public transport system last year. And while no-one went to lost property for their sex toys, two people popped up to reclaim their Viagra, Transport for London (TfL) said. TfL raised more than £160,000, as items left more than three months are donated to charity, binned or auctioned. But it’s probably safe to say the dildos couldn’t be resold. Last year saw a total of 180,417 items handed into TfL lost property offices, with more than half forgotten on the London bus network. This included 22,696 phones – which worked out at more than 60 a day – yet almost half were never reclaimed by their owners. There were also 29,015 bags, 34,742 books and 8,160 sets of keys left behind, according to a Freedom of Information request. Some 4,155 were also lost but 98% of people never bothered trying to get them back. And around £125,000 in cash was also left on buses, Tubes and trains last year which was never claimed back. As well as raising money for charity, TfL covers the costs of running its lost property office by charging for admin costs when people reclaim their items. That may be why no one bothered collecting their umbrellas – but it still makes £250,000 annually from the admin fees. For charity, last year TfL auctioned off a top-of-the-range Microsoft laptop for £573 and an Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max for £460. In recent years it made £731 from the auction sale of an Apple MacBook Pro, £2,350 for a gold and diamond ring and £3,700 for a Zenith Platinum watch.
