Prince Harry and Meghan Markle visited the Queen in secret this morning, before going to the Invictus Games. The couple, who have not been in the UK together since they quit as senior working royals more than two years ago, are also believed to have met with Prince Charles. Harry, who has had a tense relationship with other members of the Royal Family in recent times, met the ageing monarch amid long-standing concerns about his safety in the UK, and then went on to the Hague. The trip comes after the Duke of Sussex was absent for the memorial service to his grandfather Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, in London last month. The couple visited Windsor in a trip the duke suggested previously he ‘hoped to do’. Harry is bringing a claim against the Home Office after being told he would no longer be given the same degree of security when visiting from the US, despite offering to pay for it himself. The duke wants to bring his children to visit, but he and his family are ‘unable to return to his home’ because it is too dangerous, his legal representative has said. A spokesperson for the Duke confirmed earlier in March that he would miss the service for his grandfather, but that he hoped to visit the Queen soon. On Thursday night, a spokesperson for the couple confirmed they visited the Queen ahead of their appearance at the Invictus Games, founded by Harry, which open this weekend.
