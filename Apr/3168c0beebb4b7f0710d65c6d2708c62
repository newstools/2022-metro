It has happened to most of us at one time or another. An official envelope drops through the post box onto the doormat and when you notice it, your heart sinks. You approach it to find out what fine you’ve got for driving just a little too fast along the motorway. But for a driver in Germany, he was left speechless when he ripped open the letter. The man was named as the recipient of a €50 speeding fine – but the image of the perpetrator behind the wheel wasn’t him. It was of his small white dog. The nephew of the driver told The Dodo: ‘My first reaction was: “That can’t be real.” ‘I think my uncle was just as surprised.’ It was clear the image was real – but the driver’s nephew explained how it appeared the dog was driving the car, even though it obviously wasn’t. He said the dog hopped up onto the motorist’s lap at the exact same moment they passed the traffic camera. ‘Normally, the dog wears a special car belt for the safety,’ the nephew added. ‘That day, my uncle forgot to put it on him, and the dog came to cuddle him [as he was driving]. The funny part is, he was in his lap for just three seconds.’ And that was just long enough for the dog to be papped. He said his uncle could likely have contested the speeding ticket due to a lack of proof it was him driving – but he fessed up like a good citizen and paid the fine. ‘He paid it,’ the nephew said. ‘But I can’t tell you what the authorities thought.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
