A woman fell head first into a toilet pit so deep a platform had to be lowered down to help get her out. The unidentified woman in her 40s was at the top of Mount Walker in Olympic National Forest, Washington, when she dropped her cell phone into the human waste-filled void. The local fire department said the went to great lengths to get it back. They said: ‘She then attempted to dismantle the toilet and retrieve it. After disassembling the seat and housing, she used her dog’s leash to try fishing it out. ‘Eventually, she took the leashes to help support herself, which failed, and she slid into and fell into the vault head first.’ She managed to find her phone and after about 20 minutes used it to dial 911 to get help. Quilcene Fire Rescue went to her aid, creating a makeshift platform for her to stand on so they could hoist her up. The fire department washed her down and gave her some white overalls similar to what forensics teams wear at a crime scene. She said she wasn’t injured and turned down the offer of transportation despite being advised to get medical help after being exposed to so much human waste. She thanked the emergency responders and continued on her way back to California, where she is from. The fire department said: ‘The patient was extremely fortunate not to be overcome by toxic gases or sustain injury.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
