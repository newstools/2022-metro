Bad news folks, we may not be getting that extra annual bank holiday after all. Brits are getting an extra day off on June 3 this year to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. Hopes were raised that this could become a permanent fixture as the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and Hospitality UK threw their weight behind a campaign. Rishi Sunak was expected to consider the proposal, which will cost the economy billions of pounds. But Downing Street has poured cold water on the calls today, with the PM’s official spokesperson saying: ‘I’m not aware of any plans to make it permanent.’ He stressed the four-day weekend in June 2022 is to mark a ‘unique event’. But, offering a glimpse of hope, he added: ‘But obviously we keep the cost of these things under review.’ Each bank holiday ‘presents a considerable and significant cost to our economy and therefore each proposal would have to be considered carefully on that basis’, it was stated. The proposed new ‘thank holiday’ would recognise the Queen’s ‘extraordinary service’, campaigners say. It would also be a nod people’s efforts to support their communities, especially over the last two years during the pandemic. The Telegraph and The Express have both suggested Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie are supportive of the extra day of relaxation. England and Wales are scheduled to have eight bank holidays in 2023 – a far smaller number than many other countries around the world. Finland has the highest number of bank holidays in Europe with a grand total of 15. Western European nations are among the least generous handing them out – but France and Italy still have 11, while Portugal has 10 and Germany nine.
