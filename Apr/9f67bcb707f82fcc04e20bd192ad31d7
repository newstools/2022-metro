Nostalgic and current Barbie fans rejoice – there’s now a life-size camper van in action, based off the Barbie Dream Camper toy. The all-pink glamping experience is in Malibu – but it’s unclear if just anyone can book on just yet. At the very least, it gives good DIY inspo. The 30-foot motorhome comes fully-furnished with dinnerware, toiletries, and accessories – plus it has a working kitchen. There’s also a pop-open canopy to create a large outdoor living space, which is ideal for al fresco meals. If you want to roam, there’s a hot pink tent and toys to grab and go with too. Camp, a family experience company behind the van, said: ‘The custom-outfitted RV is bright Barbie pink, the real-life version of the playtime favourite. ‘Dazzle guests with gourmet meals prepared in a furnished kitchen which includes a stovetop, oven, and refrigerator. ‘Visitors of all ages are invited to take part in camping-themed play and nature activities, such as RV-inspired activity books, showcasing the wonders of hitting the open road for summertime family vacations. ‘The pop-open canopy creates an expanded outdoor living room and is perfect for enjoying an al fresco picnic or eat inside at a dream dinette table with seating for four. ‘Barbie’s camper comes fully furnished with dinnerware, toiletries, and accessories so you can jump in and go.’ A competition just ran for US residents to stay in the camper, but whether it will be bookable afterwards is yet to be seen. This new experience comes after Mattel – the makers of Barbie – offered fans a chance to stay in the Malibu dream house. Do you have a story to share?
