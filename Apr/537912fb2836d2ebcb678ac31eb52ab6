A Conservative MP snorted ‘line after line’ of cocaine before groping a woman’s breasts in her flat, reports say. David Warburton, who represents Somerset and Frome, has been at the centre of a Westminster scandal since the news emerged last night. Now, a photo has since been released of the married MP sitting down next to ‘lines of cocaine’ on a baking tray. He allegedly took the Class A drug before stripping down and getting into bed with the woman. The Sun reports he sent her a text the next morning asking if she was ‘proud’ an MP had slept in her home, adding: ‘Promise I won’t remove all my clothes again.’ She claims he also offered to pay £160 for the cocaine that she purchased. The woman reportedly told Mr Warburton that she did not want to have sex with him, but she claims he still ‘ground his body’ against hers before climbing into her bed. She told the newspaper she was ‘frozen to the spot’ until he fell asleep. Two other women have also accused Mr Warburton of making unwanted sexual comments and indecent touching. Mr Warburton, 56, defended himself yesterday. He said: ‘I have enormous amounts of defence, but unfortunately the way that things work means that doesn’t come out first. ‘I have heard nothing whatsoever from the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme. I’m sorry, I can’t comment any further.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted Mr Warburton for additional comment. A spokesperson for the Whips Office said: ‘David Warburton MP has had the Conservative Party whip removed while the investigation is ongoing.’ The 56-year-old was first elected in 2015 with a majority of 20,268, or 53% of the vote, the largest constituency swing to the Conservative Party at that election. He was re-elected in 2017 and 2019, with majorities of 22,906 and 19,213, respectively. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
