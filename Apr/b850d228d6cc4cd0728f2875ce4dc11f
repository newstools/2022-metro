Kim Kardashian has surpassed herself with a brand-new joint campaign for her underwear brand Skims that just casually features Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks, Candice Swanepoel and Alessandra Ambrosio. The word ‘iconic’ is over-used – including by reality star and entrepreneur Kim herself – but we won’t quibble with her on this one. Unveiling their photo shoot on the official Skims Instagram account with a series of fierce group and individual images, the caption on the first group shot of the models – who have all previously been Victoria’s Secret Angels – read: ‘Introducing Tyra, Heidi, Alessandra and Candice in their first ever joint campaign. Wearing our signature Fits Everybody collection, it doesn’t get more iconic than this.’ Clips from the shoot were then uploaded of the icons as they ‘join forces for the first time’ and were seen modelling the Fits Everybody collection, which retails from £14. The models also had their individual photos shared on Instagram too, with 48-year-old America’s Got Talent judge Heidi in a black bralette and thong, while Candice, 33, opted for beige-toned t-shirt and thong. Tyra, also 48, looked fabulous in full briefs and a bralette, while Alessandra posed in a bodysuit as well as boy shorts and a cami top. Even better, Kim – who only last month launched a swimwear collection for Skims – later revealed that she was inspired to join in with the queens during the shoot. Sharing a couple of snaps of herself also modelling from the collection and surrounded by her model pals, she posted: ‘OK so I wasn’t supposed to be in this @SKIMS campaign but I stopped by and jumped in because it was too iconic. Introducing Tyra, Heidi, Alessandra and Candice wearing our signature SKIMS Fits Everybody collection.’ Her family and followers were out in force with their full-throated support. ‘BEYOND FABULOUS!!!!!! 👏👏👏👏’, screamed (we assume) Kim’s mum Kris Jenner, while sister Khloe Kardashian fittingly posted five crowns. She then followed up with five coffins, signifying her slayed status, as the family gets ready to return to reality TV with new show The Kardashians later this month. There were many fans repeating the proclaimed ‘iconic’ status of the shoot, while one chimed in with: ‘KIMS SECRET !!! Victoria who?’ Keeping it relatable, Kim, who reportedly met beau Pete Davidson’s grandparents recently when she visited him filming in New York City, then added a group shot of everyone’s hands diving into boxes of baked goods after all the modelling was done and dusted. ‘Nothing like @beignetbox to wrap a @skims lingerie shoot,’ she captioned it, tagging her icons’ hands in the process. Speaking to People magazine, Brazilian supermodel Alessandra said that the foursome had ‘the best time’ on set and revealed that she felt ‘honoured’ to have been selected by Kim as an icon. ‘To be honest, I believe that only others can call someone an icon so I have never thought of myself that way,’ she shared. Kim is getting pretty cosy with some of the world’s leading models, having collaborated with Kate Moss last summer for Skims. Meanwhile her ex Kanye West has reportedly pulled out of his headline slots at Coachella with less than two weeks to go. It is unclear why the dad-of-four pulled the plug on his appearances set for April 17 and 24, but a source claimed to Variety that he had not rehearsed or prepared for the gig. As well as this, Travis Scott was due to join him at some point during the performances, with TMZ reporting that this is now out of the question. Got a story?
