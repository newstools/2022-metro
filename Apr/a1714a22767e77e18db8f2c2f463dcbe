X Factor icon, legend and hun Mary Byrne – known as ‘Tesco Mary on the show – has unveiled her incredible transformation after losing six stone. The powerhouse singer recently revealed that she previously weighed 21 stone while competing against the likes of One Direction and Matt Cardle in the 2010 series. However, almost 12 years later, the diva showed off her new short blonde ‘do and couldn’t look happier sue to her health kick. ‘I looked at the picture of me on the show and me now and I honestly was shocked,’ she told the Irish Mirror. ‘Because it has happened gradually over the decade I guess I haven’t noticed it as much but yes, it is a shocking amount of weight loss. ‘I was just under 21 stone on the show and I am now just over 15 stone.’ Mary praised her daughter for encouraging her to change her lifestyle, and said she even feels ready to come off anti-depressants. ‘My daughter is the reason behind it and we fight like cats and dogs because she is so strict on me. But it has worked,’ enthused Mary. ‘She won’t let me do the shopping because she knows I buy rubbish, which I will, but she has made me realise that life is there for living.’ Mary said she’s transformed her body by simply eating smaller portions. Since coming fifth on The X factor, Mary has released four studio albums including her debut LP which topped the charts in Ireland, going two-times platinum. Got a story?
