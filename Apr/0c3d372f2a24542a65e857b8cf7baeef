Jet lag is the price we pay for our long haul travels and, no matter how excited we are about our far-flung holidays, it comes for us all sooner or later. And sometimes it can hit hard, especially when we travel east and have to try and force ourselves to go to sleep earlier than our bodies are used to. For anyone looking to minimise the disruption of jet lag, Superdrug is now selling melatonin tablets to help your body clock adjust. Melatonin is a hormone that can help you fall asleep faster and be less likely to wake up in the night. The pills are available via the Superdrug Online Doctor. A pack of 10 3mg tablets is going for £24 and a pack of 20 will set you back £34. The Online Doctor page also has some handy non-pharmaceutical advice for getting over jet lag quickly. Other than trying to adapt as soon as possible when you reach your destination, you should start your journey as rested as you possibly can be. You should also try to get into the swing of the new time zone on the plane by sleeping when it’s nighttime where you’re headed. Do you have a story to share?
