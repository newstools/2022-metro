The brother of a man who died in a suspected gas explosion fears an appliance may have been bought in anticipation of the energy price cap rising. Frank Burton, 91, was killed when his mock Tudor house in Wythenshawe, Greater Manchester, was blown apart last night. Smoke was seen billowing out of a huge hole on the second floor in Brownley Road. Neighbours were evacuated and there was a power cut in several nearby buildings. Frank’s brother Philip, 71, told reporters at the scene: ‘The explosion is typical of gas. ‘Whether that’s mains gas, or if he had something in to help with the cold snap and anticipating rise in energy, he may have bought something.’ The family watched on as fire crews surveyed and secured the house this morning. Paying tribute, Philip added: ‘He was a good character and a good guy.’ Frank, a dad of two, was a widower after his wife Brenda died a decade ago. ‘Frank was in the motor industry, he used to do body work and was highly skilled and respected,’ said Philip. ‘This is a chap who when he was working once went ballooning over the Grand Canyon. He was an occasional visitor to Las Vegas. ‘I haven’t been able to reach Frank for some time, he was deaf. He was deaf because he got blown out of bed during the War during The Blitz in Manchester.’ Four fire crews wearing gas masks were at the scene of the explosion from around 6.30pm to 8pm to get the blaze under control. The house remains condoned off and three windows and the door at the front are smashed. The cause of the explosion has not yet officially been confirmed and investigations at the scene are continuing. Eyewitnesses reported hearing a ‘huge’ bang which ‘shook their houses like an earthquake’ as the house exploded. The evacuated residents and their pets were welcomed into a local church to keep warm with cups of tea before they could return home.
