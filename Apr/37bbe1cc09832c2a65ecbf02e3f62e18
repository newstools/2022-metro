Nothing beats a good cup of tea. Whether it’s morning, noon or night, a cuppa makes everything better. As most British people understand, the making of a cup of tea is an art form. It is seriously difficult to get right. And now, one expert has shared the scientifically correct way to make a brew. However, his method may divide opinion. Dr Andrew Stapley, of Loughborough University, is a chemical engineer who has undertaken important research to find the perfect cup of tea. In news that may disgust the nation, Dr Stapley says you should make your tea with the milk poured in first. Dr Stapley found that if you pour milk into a hot tea, the milk will heat unevenly which will cause the proteins in your milk to alter their natural quality. This is the main cause of floaty bits that sometimes appear at the top of your cup. This also causes the milk to lose its flavour in the tea-making process. The research also revealed that pouring milk into the cup before the hot water can help to prevent hard water, as the proteins in the milk can lower the mineral content of your water and bring back the flavour to an otherwise mediocre brew. While the science may say differently, we think we will stick to the method we know and love. Hot water poured in first and a splash of milk afterward, thank you very much.
