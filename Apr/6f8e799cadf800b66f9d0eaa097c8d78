Sophie Ellis-Bextor was surrounded by family, including all five of her children, when she blew out the candles to celebrate her 43rd birthday. The Murder On the Dancefloor singer was presented with a cake in her fabulous kitchen – home to many a kitchen disco during lockdown – while her five sons, aged three to 17, looked on. She was dressed with her usual flair in a heart-print T-shirt with a red sleeveless jumper over the top, sitting with her arms around her two youngest sons, Jesse, who was born in 2015, and three-year-old Mickey. The moment was captured by Sophie’s mum Janet, as the family gathered together to mark the day, with the former Blue Peter presenter sharing the rare snapshot of Sophie with all of her kids at once. ‘Happiest of birthdays to my darling first born (with her five borns),’ Janet captioned the picture. Sophie, who raised over £1million for BBC Children In Need after dancing for 24 hours straight in a massive Kitchen Disco Dancethon in November,shares her children with husband Richard Jones, the award-winning songwriter and bassist for indie group The Feeling. The pair met in 2002 when she hired Richard to play in her band and welcomed their first baby, Sonny, now 17, when they’d only be going out for eight months. They married in Italy in 2005 and had second son Kit, 12, in January 2009 and third son Ray, almost 10, in late April 2012. Strictly Come Dancing star Sophie was even able to share birthday decorations with husband Richard, who celebrated his 43rd birthday just four days before her. Sharing a picture of him pretending to shout in front of a display of multi-coloured balloons, Sophie wrote: ‘Happy Birthday, baby! 🥳🥳🥳 @richardjonesface = 43 xxxx’ She then took a selfie by the same decorations on her special day and remarked: ‘I like getting older. It’s a privilege. Plus there’s cake. 👍🏻🎈🥳’ Sophie previously spoke about how taking part in Strictly took its toll on her marriage at the time, revealing that she wished there had been ‘emotional support’ available to cope with its intensity.
