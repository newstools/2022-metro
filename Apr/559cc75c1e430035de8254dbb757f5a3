A generous boss has given his staff a £120 monthly pay boost to help them combat spiralling bills. Martin Finlayson’s ‘cost-of-living allowance’ will swell his workers’ pay packets regardless of their role at Lothian Building Supplies. The DIY boss, 49, said he knows it won’t solve all their financial woes during these trying times, but he hopes the extra cash will ease the burden. ‘We are nothing without our staff,’ he announced on LinkedIn. ‘Fuel and energy bills are through the roof, it’s hard out there for everyone. ‘That’s why we are now introducing a £120 per month cost of living allowance extra payment for all staff irrespective of role because we are all part of the same team. ‘It won’t fix everything wrong with the world but hopefully it will ease the pressure on staff and their families just a little.’ Mr Finlayson’s decision was soon praised online. ‘This guy certainly understands the value of his employees,’ one person wrote. ‘Well done Martin Finlayson.’ Another simply put: ‘How wonderful.’ Lothian Building Supplies has served Edinburgh and the Lothians for more than 20 years. The jump in household bills is the biggest in living memory and has seen costs rocket by 54% to just under £2,000 a year. But there are fears energy prices could soar even higher without further Government intervention. Earlier this week, the head of Octopus Energy, Greg Jackson, warned: ‘Unless there’s a very rapid fall in the global prices, energy costs for people in the UK will stay high over the winter. ‘They could even be higher.
