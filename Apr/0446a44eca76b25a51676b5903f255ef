How do you like your toast in the morning? With butter and jam? Slathered in marmite? Maybe some peanut butter and banana to start the day off? Whichever way you like your toast, there’s no denying it’s a breakfast staple – but have you ever thought about eating it upside down? Now food experts have said this could be a top tip for making the most of your breakfast. They say the secret to great toast is all in the way you hold the bread. According to experts at EatThis, eating toast upside down will ‘change your life.’ The reason? They say it all comes down to tastebuds. ‘First, make sure your toppings pass the upside-down test,’ they explain. ‘If so, eat your toast topping-side down so that your tastebuds get the most out of the toast-eating experience. ‘This totally goes against the grain, but trust us.’ In addition to toast, they also advise people to trim vegetables and store them in water to keep them ‘crisp’ and fresh for longer. Meanwhile, they suggest adding a slice of bread to the container you store cookies in. Doing so will keep the cookies ‘moist’ and avoid them going crunchy less than a week after baking.
