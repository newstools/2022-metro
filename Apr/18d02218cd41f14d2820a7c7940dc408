Google has submitted plans for its gigantic campus in King’s Cross in London, and they’re striking. This will be the first wholly-owned and designed Google building outside of the US and will comprise a staggering one million square feet of space spread out over an 11-story building. To put it into context, Google’s building will be longer than the Shard is tall. As well as office space for up to 4,000 Google employees to work, the area will also feature a pool, games area, gym, landscaped roof garden and a parade of retail space for shops and other businesses to occupy. The tech giant says that, when finished, the area ‘will be a resource not just for Googlers but Londoners, too.’ The building, known as KGX1, will combine with Google’s existing offices at 6 Pancras Square and should be completed by 2024. ‘We want the spaces and experiences we offer to create opportunity for local people and businesses, and contribute to the culture of entrepreneurship and vibrancy of the area,’ said Google’s Ronan Harris in a blog post. ‘We plan to offer the shop units to a mix of established and growing brands, and provide support to help great ideas grow. Alongside the individual retail units, a market hall will offer a launchpad for small businesses, while a community, education and event space will host a changing programme of events all year round. ‘As well as offering a quiet green space for breaks during the work day, a densely planted outdoor roof garden, with a rainwater irrigation system, will provide a habitat for protected species of bats and birds. We’re collaborating with the London Wildlife Trust and the borough of Camden as part of a wider initiative to protect our native species and improve local biodiversity.’ MORE : Google lures employees back into the office with free electric scooters MORE : Google employee outlines how the tech giant is embracing flexibile working
