Michael Owen believes Luis Diaz will start on the bench for Liverpool against Manchester City on Sunday. Jurgen Klopp’s side head to the Etihad with just one point separating themselves and the Premier League leaders with just eight games of the season remaining. Diaz, a January signing from Porto, has played a key role in Liverpool cutting the gap on City with the Colombia international on target again against Benfica in Tuesday’s Champions League clash. The Reds secured a 3-1 win in the first leg clash away in Lisbon with Diaz playing the full 90 minutes with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane both withdrawn with one eye on Sunday’s clash against City. And with Jota rested from the start, former Liverpool striker Owen believes Diaz will settle for place on the bench this weekend. ‘The way Jurgen Klopp managed his substitutions would suggest maybe not,’ Owen told BT Sport when discussing whether Diaz will start. ‘Bringing Mohamed Salah off, bringing Sadio Mane off, you would think Jota would have to play – he has been playing very well and he didn’t start today. ‘So potentially not. Before the game I thought he would [start against City] but based on that, leaving him on for the full game, I don’t think so.’ City warmed up for Sunday’s huge clash league clash with a 1-0 win over Atletico Madrid in their quarter-final first leg clash with Kevin de Bruyne on the score sheet.
