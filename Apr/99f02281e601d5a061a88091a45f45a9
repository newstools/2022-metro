A man murdered his girlfriend’s three-year-old son after fracturing his ribs more than 20 times during weeks of ‘horrendous’ beatings, a jury has found. Kemarni Watson Darby died from an internal bleed after suffering injuries akin to a car crash at the hands of Nathaniel Pope. The little boy’s ribcage was fatally ‘crushed’ at the two-bedroom flat Pope shared with Kemarni’s mother, Alicia Watson, in West Bromwich on June 5, 2018. Pope, 32, a convicted drug dealer, was found unanimously guilty by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court after they heard Kemarni’s body had 34 external injuries. Watson, 30, was cleared of murdering her son but found guilty of causing or allowing his death. Pope and Watson blamed each other during the trial, but were found to be ‘partners in crime’ who continued living together for several months after Kemarni’s death. Kemarni’s mother cut a defiant and angry figure in court, accusing barristers of lying and dismissing the case against her as ‘disgustingly wrong’. She always insisted her son must have been attacked by Pope while she was away from their flat, and she also claimed she had no idea how his ribs were broken. When asked to account for the 34 injuries her toddler’s body, she said: ‘I didn’t cause them, I didn’t see them. I loved and cared for my child for three years.’ But prosecutors said Watson had not been living with a ‘secretive child abuser’ but acted with Pope to abuse Kemarni ‘for days, months and hours on end’. Pope, of Wolverhampton, and Watson, of Handsworth, Birmingham, were also convicted of child cruelty over the rib fractures Kemarni suffered before the fatal blow. The pair were separately convicted of two further counts of child cruelty in relation to other children. Both will be sentenced at a later date.
