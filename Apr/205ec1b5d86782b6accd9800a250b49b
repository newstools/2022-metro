Logan Paul impressed WWE fans with his in-ring debut at WrestleMania 38 and he got himself into phenomenal shape. The social media megastar teamed up with The Miz to take on Rey and Dominik Mysterio in one of the weekend’s flagship bouts, and he even came out on top as the villains claimed a big win over the father/son duo. It didn’t all go to plan for Logan on Saturday night with the A-Lister turning on him after the bell and laying him out with a Skull Crushing Finale, seemingly setting the stage for a future match. Now, the controversial YouTuber – who had clearly worked hard to master the craft – has revealed the incredible work he put in to make sure he also looked the part at WrestleMania. He shared some before and after pictures showing how he got toned and ended up with a six pack, and we’re impressed! ‘3 day body transformation I did for Wrestlemania,’ he wrote on Twitter. ‘I maintained a regiment of 100 push-ups and 100 sit-ups every day for 3 days in a row. Very happy with the results’. It comes after he compared Miz’s attack on the show to Will Smith striking Chris Rock at the Oscars, and he suggested jealousy was behind the betrayal in a statement littered with four letter words. ‘I think it’s equivalent to Will Smith slapping Chris Rock. I’m still processing why Miz betrayed me,’ he said backstage after the match. ‘To be honest with you, if I had to guess, he’s probably jealous. ‘I was doing flips, I went off the top rope. I was doing cool s**t. Quite simply, he’s obviously not capable of doing that s**t.’ He added: ‘F**k you Miz. F**k you so hard. Yeah, that’s it. Fuck you.’ It seems clear Logan will be back in a WWE ring before too long, and with this kind of dedication – and the skills he showed in the ring – we’re sure fans will love to boo him. It’s been a packed weekend for the company, with WrestleMania featuring surprise matches from ‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin and Vince McMahon, as well as a wild Jackass-style scrap between Sami Zayn and Johnny Knoxville. Knoxville used everything including bowling balls, an air horn, mousetraps and Wee Man to get the win. Got a story?
