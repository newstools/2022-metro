 Donald Trump has lashed out at Prince Harry, saying Meghan Markle has him ‘whipped’ in an explosive interview with Piers Morgan. The former US President accused the Duke of Sussex of being an ’embarrassment’ to the UK and he spared no punches for Meghan. He claimed he has not been ‘a fan’ of hers since their high-profile began, accusing her of leading Harry around ‘by his nose’. ‘I’ve been a very good predictor, as you know,’ he told Piers on his new show for TalkTV. ‘I’ve predicted almost everything. It’ll end, and it’ll end bad.’ It was the latest attack from Trump, whose presidency ended in carnage as a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol building, leaving five dead. Trump said Harry had been ‘led down a path’ and was ‘whipped’ – an insulting phrase used to describe a man who is controlled by his female partner. ‘Harry is whipped like no person I think I’ve ever seen,’ he told the former Good Morning Britain host. ‘I’m not a fan of Meghan, I’m not a fan, and I wasn’t right from the beginning. I think poor Harry is being led around by his nose.’ Piers then asked Trump what the Queen should have done when the Sussexes left Britain and stepped down from their royal duties in 2020. He responded: ‘The only thing I disagree with the Queen on – probably one of the only things ever – is that I think she should have said, if that’s your choice, fine, but you no longer have titles, and frankly don’t come around. ‘He has been so disrespectful to the country and I think he’s an embarrassment.’ Trump’s interview follows Harry and Meghan flying from their home in California to secretly visit the Queen at Windsor Castle, before heading to the Invictus Games in the Netherlands. It marked their first public appearance together in Europe since they quit as senior working royals more than two years ago. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
