A man has appeared in court charged with attacking Sir Iain Duncan Smith. Elliot Bovill, 31, is alleged to have assaulted the former Conservative Party leader in Manchester on October 4 last year. It comes after the senior Tory claimed he had been struck across the head with a traffic cone while visiting the city. He was reportedly walking close to where the party’s conference was taking place with his wife Betsy and was due to take part in a talk with then-Brexit minister Lord Frost at the Mercure Manchester Piccadilly Hotel. Sir Iain escaped the October 4 incident without serious injury and Greater Manchester Police arrested five people. He told The Spectator at the time: ‘For half a second I was about to go up and punch them, I went forward and they all backed off – I nearly knocked them out, lost my rag’. No further details about Mr Bovill’s alleged offence were read out in court and no plea was taken. Two other defendants have been charged in connection with the incident. Ruth Wood, 50, from Cambridge, is accused of using threatening, abusive words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of/provoke unlawful violence. She appeared by video-link and was also bailed until May 16. Radical Haslam, 28, of Manchester, did not attend court. Mr Bovill, of no fixed address, was granted unconditional bail and must appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on May 16. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
