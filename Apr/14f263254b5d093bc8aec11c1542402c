A British man has been accused of spying for Russia and charged with nine offences under the Official Secrets Act, police have revealed. David Ballantyne Smith, 57, was extradited back to the UK today and is due to appear in court on Thursday. He had been living in Potsdam, Germany, before being flown home by the authorities. The charges relate to the collection and communication of information useful to the Russian state, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. The force says he had been working as a security guard at the British Embassy in Berlin. Smith had initially been arrested by German police on 10 August, 2021. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said that one of the charges relates to allegations he passed information to a person he believed was a representative of the Russian state. Nick Price, head of special crime and counter terrorism division at the CPS, said: ‘David Smith has been charged with nine offences contrary to the Official Secrets Act. ‘He is accused of seven offences of collecting information with the intent of sending it to the Russian authorities, one of attempting communication and one of providing information to a person he believed was a member of the Russian authorities. ‘After reviewing the case and authorising charges, we obtained an extradition warrant and worked closely with our German counterparts in order to bring Mr Smith back to the UK.’ The alleged offences were committed between October 2020 and August 2021. The investigation is being led by the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
