A woman has revealed how she had four babies in just 13 months after getting pregnant twice and using a surrogate who gave birth to twins. Now, the 45-year-old who is mum to five has insisted she loves every part of her hectic life. Tracy documents her busy life on her Almost Triplets TikTok page, and recently shared a video explaining how she managed to create such a big family. ‘At 40 years old, I had a wonderful 10 year old son, but he yearned for a bigger family,’ Tracy says. ‘The day I found out I was pregnant was the same day I signed the contract to move forward with with our surrogate.’ Tracy gave birth to her daughter Harlow, and then her surrogate gave birth to twins Piper and Presley four months later. But the fun didn’t stop there. ‘Then I had these three little babies at home, and I found out I was pregnant again,’ says Tracy. Their fifth child, Dylan, was born at 29 weeks, but is now a happy and healthy three year old. Now, Tracy has a teenage son and four more kids under the age of five, all living in the middle of New York. ‘It’s a wonderful adventure,’ she says in the video. One person commented on the clip that Tracey was ‘incredibly blessed.’ Another added: ‘I don’t think brother knew what he was asking for, but you definitely understood the assignment. Beautiful family.’ It might be a handful, but Tracey seems to be more than up for the challenge. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
