Piers Morgan has suffered another blow to his new show on TalkTV, losing nearly half its viewers overnight. The former Good Morning Britain host made a decent start to his tenure on Monday, with a peak audience of nearly 400,000 tuning into his Donald Trump debate. His second show saw a massive decline in viewers overnight, with 216,000 opting for the Tuesday edition of Uncensored. However, he’s lost yet more of the audience share, with just shy of 100,000 switching off. The BARB figures for Wednesday night’s viewership have almost halved, this time from 215,900 to 123,000. This was despite landing a chat with boxing champion Tyson Fury, who confirmed his retirement from the sport during the interview. Piers’ and TV rival Nigel Farage, who has a show on GB News, pulled in the same percentage of audience share, with both at 0.8 in their respective time slots. Sharon Osbourne’s show, which airs straight after, pulled in a crowd of just 10,000  in the 9pm slot. Tom Newton Dunn’s The News Desk at 7pm crashed to just 15,300, the night after an interview with Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Piers isn’t letting the latest setback dampen his spirits, as he quickly shouted about the huge number of views clips from TalkTV have gained on social media. ‘URGENT CORRECTION Just been told we’ve actually passed SIX MILLION social media clip views, not 3m. Even more amazing!’ he wrote. Elsewhere, he praised the team working on Piers Morgan: Uncensored, as he shared a snap with his colleagues, with the caption: ‘My brilliant ⁦@PiersUncensored ⁩ team – crushing it all over the world. 👏👏👏.’ The presenter made sure to remind followers he would be welcoming Caitlyn Jenner onto his show tonight. The news of her upcoming appearance came as quite the surprise, as Caitlyn revealed she dropped out of speaking to Piers ahead of the launch over his ‘repulsive misconduct’ after Donald Trump stormed out of his interview. But, Piers somehow convinced Caitlyn to change her mind – while also ditching a supposed slot on GB News. Sharing Caitlyn’s scathing tweet about Piers last week, the host tweeted today: ‘UPDATE: I had a great clear-the-air chat with Caitlyn on the phone last night and as a result, she will now be appearing exclusively on @PiersUncensored tomorrow night for an extended live interview.’ When one follower attempted to call Piers out by noting GB News ‘has her tonight so not an exclusive’, he put them in their place. ‘Sadly, I think you’ll find they no longer do,’ he replied. Piers Morgan: Uncensored airs weekdays from 9pm on TalkTV. Got a story?
