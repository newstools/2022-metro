Where would we be without the humble umbrella? The wet-weather companion has been seeing us through rainy days for decades –  and a London shop pays homage to the inanimate object. James Smith and Sons Umbrella Shop sits just off Tottenham Court Road and is, in many ways, an insight into Victorian London with rows upon rows of elegantly-shaped umbrellas. The shop is Europe’s oldest and most famous umbrella store – having been a London landmark for nearly 200 years. This particular spot was up and running in 1857 (following a move from Foubert Place, off Regent Street, where the shop originally opened in 1830) – and members of the original Smith family are still connected to the business. The shop offers umbrellas and parasols, as well as made-to-measure walking sticks – most of which are assembled in the workshop, with carefully-crafted parts ordered and sent from specialists across Europe. Prices for these products range, with a walking stick coming in at £30 and more bespoke items costing in the thousands. Over the years the shop has attracted quite the clientele, including well-known politicians and prime ministers such as William Ewart Gladstone, Andrew Bonar Law and George Curzon. A portrait of Jonas Hanway also hangs in the shop – the person believed to be the first Londoner to own an umbrella.
