Bruno Fernandes has defended Marcus Rashford’s performance following Manchester United’s 4-0 defeat to Liverpool on Tuesday night. United delivered one of their worst displays of the season at Anfield as a double from Mohamed Salah, along with goals from Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane, sealed a comfortable win for Jurgen Klopp’s side. Rashford, meanwhile, cut an isolated figure in United’s attack and failed to register a shot on target during the game. The 24-year-old has now failed to score in his last 13 appearances for United, but Fernandes insists it has been difficult for him to make an impact during the team’s poor run of form. When asked about Rashford’s subdued performance against Liverpool, Fernandes told Stadium Astro: ‘I don’t have anything to say about that. ‘Marcus has been professional, he’s training, he’s training well, he’s doing what he has to do. ‘Obviously when the team doesn’t perform it’s difficult for the individual to come out. ‘We don’t have to blame any player or anyone because the blame has to be on all of us.’ Fernandes also conceded that United are nowhere near the same level as Manchester City and Liverpool. ‘Liverpool were just better than us, they did everything they had to do to win the game, and they deserved it,’ said Fernandes. ‘Obviously this season has not been the best for us, we’re waiting for a different season, this one we thought it could be a different one but obliviously we’re not at the same level as Manchester City and Liverpool, they are better than us at this moment and we have to accept that.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
