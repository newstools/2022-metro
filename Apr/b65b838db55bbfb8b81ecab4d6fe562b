A manhunt has been launched after a three-month-old was kidnapped as his grandma went to get her groceries outside her home in San Jose, California. CCTV images show a man walking down the street with a baby carrier covered with a blanket after someone entered a flat and snatched Brandon Cuellar. The little boy’s grandmother was babysitting while his mum was at work. She had gone outside for about two minutes to get her bags from the car shortly after 1pm on Monday. The baby boy was wearing a white long-sleeved onesie that had dinosaurs printed on it when he disappeared. Brandon’s distraught family say they don’t recognise the man pictured carrying the stroller. The suspect is seen wearing black trousers, a dark blue shirt and grey shoes with white trim. He also had on a black face mask and grey baseball hat. SJPD Sgt. Christian Camarill has appealed for information, saying ‘anybody who is a mother or father, you don’t love anything more than you love your child’. He added: ‘Today someone is walking around with a three-month-old baby that they didn’t have yesterday. ‘If you have this baby, please get that baby back to his mother. We can deal with the consequences after.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
