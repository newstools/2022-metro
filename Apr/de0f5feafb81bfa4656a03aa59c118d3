Camden Town Brewery has launched extra-large cans of the previously limited edition Vanilla Ice Cream Lager. And just in time for the Great British spring weather to kick off (again, hopefully). The beer company has dropped the tinnies which they promise is ‘more refreshing than a soft serve on a warm summer’s day’. We can’t lie, it sounds pretty inviting. Originally launched last year as an Arch55, their series of small-batch innovation beers, the Ice Cream Lager proved the most popular. So they’ve brought it back and made it even bigger, with the cans now being a sizeable 440ml – the brewery’s first-ever. It’s 4.8% and is available to order online in packs of four for £12. You can also find them on Sainsbury’s and Morrisons shelves. Fred Nesbitt, head of marketing at Camden Town Brewery says: ‘There’s nothing better than enjoying an ice cream (and a beer) on a warm summer’s day, and at Camden Town Brewery we thought why not combine two of our favourite flavours? ‘We took inspiration from a summer classic, vanilla ice cream, to create our very own Ice Cream Vanilla Lager. ‘We know our new beer, complete with a bigger 440ml can, is going to melt the hearts of lager lovers everywhere so be sure to keep an eye out for when it hits shelves this April.’ Do you have a story to share?
