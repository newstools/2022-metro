Villarreal midfielder Dani Parejo has accused Julian Nagelsmann of ‘disrespecting’ the Spanish club following Bayern Munich’s Champions League exit on Tuesday evening. Villarreal sealed a 1-0 victory over Bayern in the first leg of their quarter-final draw last week and Samuel Chukwueze’s late goal on Tuesday night sealed a 1-1 draw which was enough to secure a place in the semi-final for Unai Emery’s side. Speaking after the game, Parejo claimed Villarreal’s players were motivated by Nagelsmann’s reaction immediately after the Champions League quarter-final draw was made. ‘When the draw was made and they got Villarreal, their coach, whom I don’t know, disrespected not only Villarreal but also football by saying he wanted to settle the tie in the first leg,’ Parejo told Movistar. ‘It was a lack of respect towards us. ‘Sometimes when you spit up, it falls on your face.’ Villarreal striker Gerard Moreno added: ‘In the first leg we made the mistake of not finishing the tie, and all these comments serve as motivation for us. ‘They made the mistake today of not killing us off and we took advantage of that. What this team has done is great.’ Speaking after the draw, Nagelsmann did claim that Bayern could have been put up against a ‘more difficult’ opponent but spoke highly of Unai Emery and the Villarreal players. ‘They are a very, very misleading rival,’ Nagelsmann said. ‘Naturally, our demand is to go to the semi-finals and on paper there were more difficult rivals, but we must not forget that Villarreal is the current champion of the Europa League. ‘They have a coach who has won many international titles, players who have many years of experience. Beating Juventus 3-0 away is something that not everyone can do.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
