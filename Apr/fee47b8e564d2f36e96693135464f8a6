Ashley Cain was met with cheers and chants for late daughter Azaylia as he finished his 100-mile run to London in her honour. The former Ex On The Beach star is completing a run from Nuneaton, Warwickshire to Trafalgar Sqaure, London this weekend to mark the first anniversary of Azaylia’s death on April 24, 2021. Azaylia, who Ashley shared with ex-girlfriend Safiyya Vorajee, died at just eight months old following a battle with a rare form of leukaemia. On Saturday, the 31-year-old set off from his hometown alongside his cousin Tamika and brother Matty, while Safiyya briefly joined at one point with her own brother. Ashley was cheered on by a huge crowd as he reached Trafalgar Square, and was visibly emotional at getting to the end of his quest. His loved ones were on hand to embrace him, with a gathered audience chanting: ‘Let’s go champ’. Confirming that Ashley had met his goal, pal Shannon Courtenay – who joined in partway through – heaped praise on him on Instagram. ‘He’s done it,’ she penned. ‘Early hours this morning I joined @mrashleycain at mile 70 on his 100 mile run to raise money for children with cancer. His body was in bits & I didn’t think he was going to make it at one point!! ‘Ashley you inspire & motivate me everyday & im so proud to call you my friend. Like the rest of us Azaylia will be looking down on her daddy today so proud of everything you’ve achieved since she’s passed & how many other children with cancer your helping.’ As the group trudged towards the final stretch, Ashley had a surprise guest in the form of survivalist and SAS: Who Dares Wins star Ant Middleton, who donned an orange T-shirt in honour of Azaylia. ‘Major turning point today. In our final few miles going into the home straight, that’s when this man turned up,’ Ashley revealed in a video clip shared to Instagram. Cheering on his pal, Ant then interjected: ‘Listen he had it in the bag already, he’s got it in the bag I’ve just come for a bit of motivation just to pump that lion’s heart of his. Give it a few more beats to get him over the finish line. ‘The team is amazing, Ashley is amazing and listen, I wouldn’t do it. I’m not that mad.’ Returning the compliment, Ashley added: ‘What a man, what a bank of knowledge, what a heart, grateful to have him on-board for these last few miles. We’re hunting down that finish line like a hungry pack of lions… ‘I’m gonna be honest, Ant Middleton has been an absolute diamond. What a tough guy, but what a big heart.’ Safiyya, 34, offered her support to the group via Instagram and chose to mark the day at Azaylia’s garden. The aesthetic practitioner shared a heartbreaking post in tribute to her baby girl along with a throwback video of her singing to the little one in her final days. ‘A year without my daughter you are such a beautiful baby Azaylia 😢 and when I say it doesn’t get any easier I mean that with a full heart ❤️ If love could of saved you I promise you would be here with me I will hold you in my heart & forever be connected with you for eternity❤️,’ she began the lengthy post. ‘The pain of not having my baby here on earth with me rips my body and soul to pieces everyday I open my eyes! ‘Azaylia you made me a mummy and that title is the most precious one I will treasure forever , knowing I have given birth to my hero my inspiration my daughter is something I will keep close to my heart forever 🤍’ Safiyya continued: ‘The night before you passed we sang this song together for the last time in bed, this was our song that always kept us believing in the most darkest times. 😢 ‘You achieved more in your 8months on earth than many of us will in a life time, you are helping so many children & families baby you are an inspiration 🤍 truly missed & loved I love you keep flying high in heaven with all the other Angels👼 ‘With a heavy heart today and everyday baby mummy loves you so much I know your in the highest heaven and you look down on me today sat at your garden side from morning till night reflecting I love you so much 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍 ‘The pain loss & emotion I’m feeling today is incredibly overwhelming.’ Ashley and Safiyya had fought tirelessly to secure specialist treatment for Azaylia, including raising £1million through a GoFundMe in just 24 hours. However, they were told that their daughter’s cancer had become too advanced and that it would not be possible to fly her to the Singapore clinic. Following her death, the pair set up The Azaylia Foundation in her name to raise awareness about childhood cancer and funds for young ones also battling disease. Earlier this month, Ashley and Safiyya announced they had split but would remain supportive friends. Got a story?
