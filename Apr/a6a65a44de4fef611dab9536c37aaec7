A granddad was horrified when he checked his smart meter and found his daily electricity bill was a whopping £42,241. Peter Chambers, 64, has a look at the device every morning, and usually sees a 50p increase. So he was astonished when he saw it had shot up and immediately rang EDF to report the error. Peter made sure he was sent a copy of his true bill, which is usually about £30 a month, but is still awaiting a replacement meter five months later. Cleaner Peter, from Ipswich, Suffolk, said: ‘I was thinking about dialling 999 because I had a pain in my chest — I nearly had a heart attack! ‘I looked at that and thought, “How am I going to prove I don’t use that much? They’re going to think I’ve got a cannabis farm in my loft!”‘ He added: ‘I do check it every day without fail, because I just like to see if it’s charged me for what I’ve used. ‘My total bill for the whole month is only £32, and I’m used to seeing between 30p and 50p, tops.’ Peter was horrified to see the incredible bill for his one-bedroom flat. He rang EDF, recalling: ‘They go, “No, your readings are fine this end, you must have a faulty display”. ‘For my peace of mind they did a fresh bill up to that day, so I could see there was an error on the display. ‘I saw a news bulletin about some lady with British Gas who got an incorrect reading — it’s the same meter.’ EDF has been approached for comment.
