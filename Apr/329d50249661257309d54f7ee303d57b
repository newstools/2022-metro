A 91-year-old has been left ‘heartbroken’ after an arsonist targeted a beloved hedgerow planted by her husband 62 years ago. Fire crews arrived at the scene in Cricklade, Wiltshire, but the hedge was already destroyed. Posting on Facebook, her grandson said: ‘Someone thought it would be funny to set fire to my Grandma’s conifer bushes at the front of her house. ‘Grandma is 91 years old and loves her garden and the trees were put in by my gramp 62 years ago and she is heartbroken to say the least.’ Wiltshire Police said it had launched an investigation into the incident which was being treated as arson. A spokesperson said: ‘It is believed the fire was started deliberately, and then spread to wooden planks on a nearby garage. ‘Thankfully nobody was injured but we are carrying out enquiries, including speaking to people living in the area who may have witnessed anything suspicious.’ Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service sent four fire engines to douse the flames. It said: ‘Crews from Swindon, Stratton, Cirencester and Tetbury attended the incident which involved the garage roof of a two-storey property and the hedgerow of another property.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
