Dillian Whyte’s brother Dean has insisted there is no need for a replacement fighter for next week’s bout against Tyson Fury. Fury and Whyte are set to meet for the WBC heavyweight title at Wembley Stadium on Saturday 23 April after a bad-tempered build-up. Representatives from both camps have been involved in a series of disputes over various contractual issues with Whyte refusing to appear at a press conference last month. Fury’s promoter Frank Warren revealed last week they have an unnamed fighter ready to step in should Whyte pull out of the fight on late notice – although the Queensberry Promotions chief added there were no suggestions of that happening. Whyte’s brother Dean insists however the Brixton heavyweight is ‘raring to go’. ‘It’s surprising that they’ve lined up a substitute, although maybe not that surprising if you consider the magnitude of the fight and how much money they have spent on it,’ Whyte told BoyleSports. ‘Maybe they feel discussions with the team aren’t going well and Dillian’s silence, maybe that’s giving them some reservations that Dillian might not turn up. ‘But he’s training very hard, he’s putting all of the work in in the gym. And all of the talking is going to be left to be done in the ring. ‘Dillian is mentally in great shape, physically he’s in great shape. He’s ready and raring. He’s all smiles but he’s serious underneath, he knows he’s got a task at hand. ‘We know our game plan and we’re going to go out there and impose what we need to impose.’ MORE : Tommy Fury to feature on confirmed Tyson Fury vs Dillian Whyte undercard at Wembley Stadium MORE : Tyson Fury brings in disgraced drugs cheat Jarrell Miller for sparring ahead of Dillian Whyte fight For more stories like this, check our sport page.
