A cat photobombed Sky News on Tuesday night, much to the delight of viewers at home. Deputy political editor Sam Coates attempted to deliver the latest update on Boris Johnson’s partygate scandal live on air and was joined by his fluffy pet for the segment. The cat’s appearance didn’t go unnoticed by presenter Mark Austin in the studio, who was quick to point out the animal to viewers. ‘He’s got his cat there with him, I’m very pleased to see that,’ the host said before adding: ‘So, some news about Carrie Johnson?’ Sam tried to solider on with his headlines while pushing his cat out of shot and started by replying: ‘That’s right.’ He then proceeded to read a statement issued by Mrs Johnson’s spokeswoman while the little furball’s paws were still visible. After Sam’s time was up, Mark again made light of the photobomber. ‘Sam Coates dealing with his cat and a big story,’ he giggled. ‘Thank you very much indeed.’ Viewers were tickled by the scenes at hand with many acknowledging that the feline’s appearance bought some light to the rather abysmal update. ‘@SamCoatesSky trying to keep his cat off-screen whilst simultaneously landing a big story is exactly what I need from my news coverage,’ enthused one. Echoing a similar sentiment, another added: ‘More of Sky News Sam Coates’ cat please. And less of Johnson’s lies.’ Of course, there have been many a photobomb on live television over the years, including the moment BBC correspondent Robert E Kelly’s two children strolled into his interview in 2017. The hilarious moment took place during his chat with BBC World News, with his wife rushing in to drag the kids out of the room. Got a story?
