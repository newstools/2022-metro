Every year The World Photography Organisation reveal their winners for the prestigious Sony World Photography Awards. This year, Adam Ferguson from Australia has won the top prize, while many other photographers have won from an array of categories, such as environment and sport. Ferguson spoke on his winning shots, which are a series of black and white self-portraits of migrants in Mexico waiting to cross the border into the United States,  saying: ‘Through collaborating with migrants, this series of photographs was an attempt to make images that inspired empathy, rather than sympathy. ‘By surrendering the control of capture and giving each migrant agency in the process of their representation, I hoped to subvert the narrative of marginalization and create a story that felt more human, relatable and honest.’ The shots can be seen at the Sony World Photography Awards 2022 exhibition which opens at Somerset House, London from April 13 – May 2, along with over 300 other prints. These are some of the highlights and other winners of this year’s competition. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
