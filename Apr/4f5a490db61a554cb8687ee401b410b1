A mum-of-four has told how a complete stranger snipped her hair during a ‘random’ attack at a bus stop in Manchester city centre. Emma Clark, 32, who coincidentally is a hairdresser, said the incident left her feeling traumatised and too nervous to take the bus again. Since then a man in his 50s has since been arrested and is being questioned on suspicion of assault. Another hair snipping incident involving another woman is also being investigated by police, but there is nothing at the moment to suggest they are linked. Emma had been to see a show in Manchester with her parents last Friday and was waiting for the bus to go to her home in Fallowfield at the end of the night. She was sat at a bus stop on Oxford Road at around 10.20pm when she felt a ‘snip sensation’ that she first mistook for a bee buzzing past her. The mum-of-four says she turned her head and saw a ‘random man’ in a rain mac, who had an umbrella and was very close to her. She felt another ‘catch’ of her hair then saw that he was waving his umbrella around, shaking and generally ‘acting weird’, so she got up and walked away. Eventually she got on the bus and texted her boyfriend, and when she got home she realised between ‘eight to 10 inches’ of her hair had been cut on one side, Manchester Evening News reports. ‘I started to feed the baby and noticed a bit of my hair hanging out. I pulled it and lots of my hair just fell out. ‘It is an awful thing. I have already had weird things happen to me on buses and now I will never, never get on a bus again. I feel really vulnerable.’ In a statement on Twitter Greater Manchester Police said: ‘We have arrested a male in his 50’s for assault. ‘This is in relation to reports of a male approaching women and cutting their hair. The male remains in police custody for questioning and further enquiries.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
