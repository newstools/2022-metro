Tom Daley had a grand old time of things partying with Sir Ian McKellen over the weekend because icons support icons. The 83-year-old acting great and the 27-year-old Olympic gold medallist both attended an event at the Troxy in East London on Saturday night. The former bingo hall founded by Jewish immigrant Maurice Cheepen, who fled Nazi Germany, paid homage to its founder’s roots with an ‘epic, all-inclusive Passover celebration’, complete with chair dancing and shofar blowing competitions. The queer club night – dubbed ‘Buttmiztvah’ – promised ‘all the hallmarks of the best simchas’ and Sir Ian and Tom looked delighted to be there in the pictures the diver shared to his Instagram. ‘Last night was so fun! 🎉🥳’, he captioned his post, sharing a string of photos from the night, including a couple with the Lord of the Rings Oscar nominee. Tom wore a black string vest for the evening and a statement metal necklace, while Sir Ian opted for a red long-line shirt, pale jeans and a collection of bead necklaces. The pair beamed into the camera, while in another they were snapped deep in conversation. Avid knitter Tom – who has admitted to making ‘so many willy warmers’ for his friends – also shared a few more group shots of the evening, and a snapshot of the stage and its performances. In an unsurprising turn of events, fans were pretty darn excited to see Tom hanging out casually with Sir Ian in such a jubilant setting. ‘This picture is the definition of Gay Icons !!!! 😍😍😍 Look at you and Sir Ian McKellen smiling !!! Legendary,’ wrote one follower. ‘What a dream to meet Sir Ian McKellen!!!’ posted another, and we couldn’t agree more. While fans were in agreement over the duo being ‘legends’, another suggested a new career path for the retired athlete. ‘Gandalf and Frodo,’ they stated, alongside plenty of screaming emojis. Sir Ian, also known for his role as Erik Lehnsherr, a.ka. Magneto, in the X-Men films, recently admitted that he wished he had told his father he was gay before he died. In 1988, the now-82-year-old came out publicly in a BBC radio interview, going on to co-found LGBT+ rights charity Stonewall the following year. Speaking to Amol Rajan, he explained: ‘He’d been to see me in my first show in the West End, I’m always glad of that. And three weeks later in a car crash he’d died. ‘The idea that he couldn’t have coped with the fact that his son was gay is inconceivable to me, even though I’m not aware that we had any gay friends or that he’d ever thought about it or that it had any impact on his life. ‘Therefore it might have come as some sort of surprise to him, but there would have been no moral judgement.’ Got a story?
