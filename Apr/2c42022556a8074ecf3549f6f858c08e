Britain will reopen its embassy in Kyiv next month in a show of support for Ukraine, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister made the commitment at a news conference during his trip to India. The decision comes after Mr Johnson made a surprise trip to the Ukrainian capital to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this month. Britain moved its embassy from Kyiv to the western city of Lviv in February shortly before the Russian invasion began. The news the embassy will be returning to the capital comes a day after Spain said it would be restoring its presence in the city. Diplomats from other European countries have been returning to Kyiv following the easing of the security situation in the wake of Russian troops retreating. Speaking in New Delhi, Mr Johnson said: ‘The extraordinary fortitude and the success of president Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people in resisting Russian forces in Kyiv means that I can announce today that we will very shortly – next week – reopen our embassy in Ukraine’s capital city. ‘I want to pay tribute to those British diplomats who remained elsewhere in the region throughout this period. ‘The United Kingdom and our allies will not watch passively as Putin carries on this onslaught.’ This is a breaking news story, more to follow soon… Check back shortly for further updates.
