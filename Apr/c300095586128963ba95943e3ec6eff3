Manchester United face competition from RB Leipzig for Erik ten Hag as the Bundesliga club have submitted an offer to Ajax’s head coach, according to reports in the Netherlands. Ten Hag is United’s top choice to replace Ralf Rangnick as manager at the end of the season. United have held extensive negotiations with Ten Hag, but the 52-year-old wants assurances over budget and squad management from the club’s hierarchy before agreeing to move to Old Trafford. However, De Telegraaf and AD are both reporting that Ten Hag’s representatives have also been in discussions with RB Leipzig and the German club have made the Dutchman an ‘excellent multi-year offer’. The reports also claim that RB Leipzig are willing to pay the compensation fee, which in excess of €2 million (£1.6m), that Ajax are requesting to allow Ten Hag to leave at the end of the campaign. United are also able to meet Ajax’s financial demands but Ten Hag is placing significant importance on the sporting project ahead of his next move. Ten Hag also refused to give anything away when asked about his talks with United on Saturday. ‘We are busy with training and with the matches,’ Ten Hag told ESPN. ‘That way you keep the focus on it. I want to talk about the game and not about other things and whether or not I’ve had conversations. I won’t comment on rumours.’ When it was put to him that the rumours about his links with United are getting stronger, Ten Hag replied: ‘Questions about the game or I am going inside.’ When asked by Dutch broadcaster NOS if he is in talks with United Ten Hag replied: ‘I will not tell you whether this is true or not.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
