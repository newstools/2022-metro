A security guard who was stationed at the British embassy in Berlin has denied spying for Russia. David Smith, 57, pleaded not guilty to nine offences under the Official Secrets Act. The British national, who was living in Potsdam, is accused of gathering information from the embassy and passing it to someone he believed was a representative of the Russian state. The alleged offences are supposed to have taken place between October 2020 and August last year. Mr Smith, 57, was remanded in custody pending his next court date at the Old Bailey on April 13. He was arrested by German police on August 10 and imprisoned before being extradited to the UK on Wednesday.

As well as information on personnel, Mr Smith is accused to collecting material about the operations and layout of the embassy that may have been ‘useful to an enemy’. He is charged with making unauthorised copies of documents, video recordings of the CCTV system and retaining packaging for SIM cards he had been ask to ‘dispose of’.
