Sound the alarm: A flagship Greggs store is coming to London’s Leicester Square. The food giant shared the news on social media this morning, with post that simply read: ‘Freshly baked goods premiering in London’s Leicester Square soon’. The beloved bakery chain also shared a picture of the work-in-progress shopfront, which is being covered by a giant photo of one of their iconic bakes in a Greggs wrapper. The other photos have revealed that the shop will be just opposite the M&M store – perfect for afters. After planning permission images were leaked back in September, rumours of such a ‘MegaGreggs’ went flying. Roughly 150 new branches are set to open over the next year, taking the total number of Greggs all over the UK to just shy of 2,500. Greggs said ‘the shop will offer local delicacies such as London Cheesecake and Tottenham Cake,’ as well as its regular selection of baked goods. Alas, we still don’t have an official date for the grand opening. A Greggs spokesperson said: ‘The opening of our new flagship shop in Leicester Square will be a huge moment as we continue to expand our presence across prime locations in Central London. ‘We’re excited to premiere our delicious food to new customers, including many tourists from outside of the UK who will get the opportunity to experience Greggs for the first time.’ Do you have a story to share?
