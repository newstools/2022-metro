A new outdoor immersive experience is coming to the UK from July, touring from Scotland through to Hertfordshire. Aimed at kids up to the age of 14, The Nickelodeon Experience is filled with activity-based rooms, themed around iconic kids shows. Even those who have to chaperone kids will likely enjoy the nostalgia of seeing memorable places recreated, such as SpongeBob’s Bikini Bottom Beach. Encouraging children to get creative and build skills through challenges, it’ll be a good day out in the summer. Some of the most popular shows with dedicated rooms include The Thundermans School for Superheroes, Henry Danger, Hunter Street, PAW Patrol, The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Baby Shark’s Big Show and Blue’s Clues. Tasks include an escape room, a maze, and other puzzles to solve – both in teams and alone. George Wood, founder of The Luna Cinema, who are working with Nickelodeon, said: ‘For years we’ve wanted to develop a truly interactive experience that allowed kids to immerse themselves in the worlds of their favourite TV shows, just as we do with Friends fans at FriendsFest and film lovers with our Luna Cinema screenings. ‘To have such an iconic catalogue of shows, including global brands like PAW Patrol, The Thundermans and SpongeBob SquarePants under the Nickelodeon umbrella is a treasure trove of content to explore and bring to life.’ As well as activities, food and drink will be available themed to match the shows. Maybe we’ll finally get to try a Krabby Patty. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
