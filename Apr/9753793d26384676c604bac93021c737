Heartstopper has completely melted viewers’ hearts upon diving into the teen romance – and the playlist has been getting plenty of love online too. The coming-of-age series follows Nick (Kit Connor) and Charlie (Joe Locke) two young LGBTQ+ schoolboys falling in love, conquering their shame, fear and bullies to bravely live as their authentic selves. From beautifully-crafted scenes showing the blossoming romance between Nick and Charlie, to the surprise appearance of absolute icon Olivia Colman as Nick’s mum, it’s no surprise the eight-parter has been met with rave reviews. Another aspect which has also caught the attention of viewers is the fantastic soundtrack. Featuring names such as CHVRCHES to Orla Gartland, it perfectly captures the emotions the two boys feel throughout, so we’ve compiled the full playlist below.
