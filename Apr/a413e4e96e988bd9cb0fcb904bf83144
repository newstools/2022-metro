A man died in a ‘frenzied’ stabbing after an attacker forced his way into his home in east London. The victim has been named by police today as Elliot Francique, 20, who lived in in Newham. Officers found him in his bedroom, with multiple knife wounds, after the ‘brutal and targeted’ attack. He was treated by paramedics from London Ambulance Service as well as London’s Air Ambulance, but he died at the scene at Hudson Close in Plaistow. The Metropolitan Police said that attack happened on Tuesday afternoon when a black male dressed in black clothing forced his way into the property, stabbed  Mr Francique several times, then left the scene on foot to Park Grove and from there towards Chad Green. Detective Chief Inspector Kelly Allen said: ‘Our enquiries to establish the identity of the suspect and the motivation behind this frenzied attack continue today. ‘Our enquiries include door to door enquiries in the area and the examination of hours of CCTV footage from a number of surrounding locations. ‘I am grateful to those people who have already come forward to speak with us and urge anyone with information who hasn’t yet been in touch to call us without delay. ‘Even the smallest piece of information could corroborate something we have already been told, or might be the missing part of the timeline of events that we are building. ‘It is our mission to remove dangerous weapons, and the dangerous people who use them, from London’s streets. Please help us make your city safer by telling us what you know.’ She said a murder investigation continues and added the next of kin are being supported by specialist officers.
