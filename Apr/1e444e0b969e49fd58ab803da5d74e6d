Two wallaby joeys have peeked their heads out of their mothers’ pouches for the first time at a British zoo. The pair of red-necked babies emerged at Marwell Zoo in Hampshire. Red-necked wallabies are usually found in south-eastern Australia and on the island of Tasmania, which is 150 miles south of mainland Australia. Mothers, Holly Wallaby and Alison, will continue to hold the joeys in their pouches until they are about seven months old. Then the youngsters will begin to leave the pouch, but regularly return. Young red-necked wallabies are born at a very early stage of development when they are just 2-2.5cm long and weighing less than 1g, about the size of a jellybean. When fully grown, they are between 70 and 90cm with a 65-75cm tail that is strong enough to support the weight of the entire animal. Senior animal keeper Amy Denny, said: ‘Holly Wallaby and Alison are first time mothers and they are doing a great job. ‘Visitors can spot our mothers as their pouches are much larger and the joeys can frequently be seen popping their heads out throughout the day, so it’s worth returning a few times!’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
