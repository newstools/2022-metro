Jose Mourinho refused to give his verdict on Manchester United’s decision to appoint Erik ten Hag and has aimed a dig at Tottenham for sacking him before Tottenham’s Carabao Cup final last season. Last week, United confirmed their decision to bring in the Ajax head coach this summer, who will replace interim manager Ralf Rangnick. Ten Hag faces a huge task of steering United back in the right direction after a woeful campaign in which the team look set to miss out on Champions League qualification. Mourinho spent just over two years in charge at United and the 59-year-old turned down the chance to offer some words of advice for Ten Hag. When asked to give his verdict on his former club’s move for the Ajax boss, Mourinho replied: ‘You touched on the point – my former club. Not my club. ‘No, I don’t have advice.’ Mourinho is preparing Roma for their Europa Conference League semi-final against Leicester City on Thursday evening. Mourinho’s last success in Europe came in 2017 when he guided United to victory over Ajax in the Europa League final. Mourinho had the chance to add another trophy to his CV last year as he led Tottenham to the Carabao Cup final against Manchester City, but the Portuguese was sacked just days before the game at Wembley. ‘I have to admit in my long career with so many things which have happened that one is quite unique,’ Mourinho said at his press conference on Thursday. ‘But Mr Levy [Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy] is also quite a unique person. ‘For all the work we have all done this season to try to improve the club at every level I think we deserve to be in the final. ‘Unfortunately, football doesn’t give you what you deserve and to get there we have to beat a very good team with a very good coach and very good players. ‘We have to be at a high level in two matches to reach the dream of taking Roma to a final.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
