Brits should enjoy the sunny Easter weekend weather while it lasts as temperatures are set to drop and showers fall in the coming days. Much of the country has seen bright and warm conditions with the warmest day of the year so far even recorded on Good Friday. Temperatures hit 23.4C in London while maximum temperatures of 21.2C in Cardiff and 19.3C in Altnaharra were reached on Saturday. Forecasters expect temperatures to remain in the high-teens throughout Sunday before they begin to drop from Easter Monday. Most of the country will see sunny spells but cloudier skies can be expected in parts of East Anglia and the south east, whilst showers may hit Northern Ireland and Scotland, the Met Office has said. ‘The idea is temperatures gradually just creeping down each day for the next few days across the UK,’ meteorologist Marco Petagna said. ‘But [on Sunday] there’s plenty of fine weather still around – most areas seeing some warm sunshine, looking at temperatures of sort of high teens locally to 20 or 21.’ The cooler conditions will bring some scattered showers, with temperatures expected to drop to single-figures by Thursday. This is not unusual for this time of year, but it may feel cooler on the east coast. Showers can be expected in the south of the country and drizzle in the north-east, while the north-west is expected to remain dry with sunny spells. Mr Petagna explained: ‘Tuesday and Wednesday could see a few showers, particularly across the south of the UK. ‘And then the second half of the week is when we get an easterly wind developing, more in the way of cloud pushing in from the east with some patchy rain but still a lot of relatively dry weather too. ‘But the trend is certainly for temperatures to take a bit of a dip so we’re sort of back down to low locally mid-single figures by Thursday.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
