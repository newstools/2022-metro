The Queen will spend her 96th birthday tomorrow at the farmhouse where her beloved husband Prince Philip lived after his retirement, according to reports. Her Majesty is expected to fly by helicopter to her 20,000-acre Sandringham estate and stay at Wood Farm until early next week. Royals and close friends will likely visit her at the five-bedroom farmhouse as she spends her real birthday privately. She is likely to celebrate in a typical low-key fashion following a number of health issues over the past year. There will be no public engagements on Thursday – but the UK is braced to mark both her second birthday and Platinum Jubilee in a huge celebration in June. It’s unclear how many events the Queen will go to as it’s believed aides will now confirm her attendance on the day in a new strategy, the Daily Mail says. The Duke of Edinburgh lived at Wood Farm after stepping down from royal duties in 2017, although travelled to Windsor to the join the HMS Bubble when the Covid pandemic hit. The monarch often visited the spot, which her husband preferred over Sandringham House. Philip is believed to have enjoyed a quiet life there, spending his time reading, painting watercolours and welcoming friends. It was modernised by the late duke who added a new kitchen and redesigned the bedrooms. The spot, part of the Sandringham Estate since the time of Edward VII, was also adored by the Queens’ late father George VI. The monarch’s right-hand woman recently revealed the Queen ‘closed to the door to be alone’ after she sat alone at Philip’s funeral in 2021. Her 96th birthday comes after Prince Harry claimed he is making sure his grandmother ‘is protected and has right people around her’.
