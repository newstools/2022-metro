Efforts to prevent a major ecological disaster on the Mediterranean are under way. A ship carrying one thousand tons of fuel was hit by bad weather and began to sink off the coast of Tunisia last night. There are fears huge quantities of oil could be leaking into the sea. The merchant tanker was heading from Equatorial Guinea to Malta when it got into trouble on Friday. All seven crew members aboard the Xelo were rescued by the navy, a security source told Reuters. The ship was transporting a large quantity of fuel when it sent a distress call seven miles away from Gabes. Specialists are still trying to assess the damage and potential fallout. The cause of the incident was bad weather, the environment ministry said, adding that water had seeped into the ship and reached a height of two metres. Authorities are working to avoid an environmental disaster and reduce repercussions, the ministry said in a statement. It’s unclear how much fuel has already leaked into the sea and whether it could impact beaches on the Mediterranean further afield.
