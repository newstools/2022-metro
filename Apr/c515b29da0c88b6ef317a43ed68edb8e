BT has handed 58,000 workers a £1,500 pay rise — the biggest increase in two decades, according to the telecoms giant that faces possible industrial action. Front-line employees across the group, including engineers, contact centre and retail staff, will receive the rise, which works out at roughly 8% for some of the lowest paid workers. But BT’s biggest union described it as ‘insulting’ and a ‘relative pay cut’, and threatened industrial action having rejected a £1,200 pay rise offer last week. The Communication Workers Union (CWU) has been pushing for a 10% rise in the face of soaring inflation, currently at 6.2% and forecast by the Bank of England to go beyond 8% by the end of the year. The union said it had ‘no choice now but to immediately prepare for a statutory industrial action ballot’. BT said the rise, which will include staff at its Openreach, Plusnet and EE businesses, comes after lengthy negotiations with the CWU. The highest paid front-line workers will see a more-than 3% increase, it added. Chief executive Philip Jansen said lower paid workers will ‘benefit most and as soon as possible’. ‘BT Group took the decision not to use redundancy and the government’s furlough scheme as a direct consequence of the pandemic, and thanks to the contribution of all 100,000 BT people, we’ve continued to improve customer ratings and invest in growing our full-fibre and mobile networks,’ he added. ‘I’m pleased that we’ve been able to make this pay award — the biggest in 20 years — to thank our colleagues and recognise their hard work.’ The revised increase comes as BT customers were hit by a 9% price rise in April. Meanwhile, Tesco said hourly pay for shop and warehouse workers will rise by 5.8% from £9.55 to £10.10, while the rate for customer delivery drivers and ‘Click+Collect’ assistants will rise to £11.
