Spencer Matthews and Vogue Williams have announced the birth of their third child. Model and presenter Vogue, 36, took to Instagram to announce the arrival of their new baby boy on Wednesday evening, sharing a photo of him being held and hugged by his older siblings. ‘We are so happy to announce that our beautiful boy arrived safely on Monday evening,’ she wrote next to the photo. ‘Bursting with love he is the perfect addition to our family ❤️’ Daughter Gigi, one, gazed down at her new brother as she held him in her lap, while three-year-old Theo leaned carefully over the newborn, obscuring his face, to give him a cuddle. Famous friends and followers rushed to congratulate the couple, who married in 2018, on their new addition. ‘❤️🙌🏼❤️🙌🏼 huge congratulations!! Xxx,’ wrote author and former Queen of the Jungle, Giovanna Fletcher, while Spencer’s former Made In Chelsea castmate Millie Mackintosh left a string of heart emojis, just like pal Rosie Fortescue. ‘AMAZING!!!!!! Congratulations lovely and all your gorgeous family ❤️❤️❤️,’ commented presenter Angela Scanlon. Spencer, 33, also shared the news of his son’s birth on Instagram, posting a photo of his bassinet with Gigi and Theodore leaning over to look at their new sibling. ‘And then there were three… ❤️,’ he captioned the picture. The pair shared their pregnancy news in October, saying that they felt ‘very lucky’ that Vogue was able to fall pregnant again. Confirming the news, she told Hello! magazine: ‘It’ll be the more the merrier. ‘Theodore and Gigi absolutely love each other, they’re always playing together. My sister Amber is my best friend and I want the three of them to be best mates.’ Spencer added: ‘It was a wonderful moment. I was delighted. ‘We’d been trying, but I never expected it to happen as easily as it did. We’re very lucky.’ The ex-reality star also shared the news with his Instagram followers and wrote: ‘WE’RE HAVING A THIRD BABY!!! ‘If you’d have told me a few years ago that by the age of 33 I’d have three beautiful children with the woman of my dreams I WOULD have believed you because that was always the plan…. ‘Having said that I feel fortunate every day for what we have. Family is EVERYTHING. ‘Love you @voguewilliams.’ Got a story?
