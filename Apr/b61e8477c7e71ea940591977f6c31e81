The families of two teenage girls who have been missing for six days are desperately appealing for help to find them. Alliyah Montaque, 15, and Lina Bennacef, 16, both from Walthamstow, east London, were last seen on Wednesday, April 13. The girls are thought to be together and their disappearance is out of character leading police and their families to grow increasingly concerned for their welfare. It is thought the pair may be in the company of an older teenager who has links to south London, the Metropolitan Police said. Destiny Montaque, 18, Alliyah’s sister told MyLondon she normally speaks to her sister daily and her disappearance was completely out of character. ‘I haven’t seen my sister in days,’ Destiny said. ‘They’ve gone off together, we don’t know where they are at all.’ Destiny said her sister did not have a phone on her, as it was confiscated by family the night before her disappearance. ‘So what’s happened is she’s left her phone – it was confiscated the night before – so she doesn’t have a phone. So she can’t contact us at all,’ she added. Anyone who sees Alliyah and Lina is asked to call 999, while anyone with information about where they are can contact police on 101 giving the reference 6276/13APR. Information can also be provided to Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111 or to the Missing People charity on 116 000. Police are also appealing to Alliyah and Lina themselves to get in touch with police or someone else they trust, to let them know they are safe.
