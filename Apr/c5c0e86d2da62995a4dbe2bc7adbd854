Shaughna Phillips has celebrated buying her first property on her own, sharing the news with her followers and joking that it ‘makes me a grown-up’. The former Love Island star took to Instagram on Friday to announce her life update and unveil plans to renovate the house by herself. Posting a picture of herself in a dusty pink jumpsuit on her Stories, posing by a sold sign outside her new home, the 28-year-old wrote: ‘Wasn’t going to share anything on the house until I had the keys in my hand, for some reason I’ve turned into the world’s biggest pessimist during this whole house buying process,’ she confessed, using a crying emoji. She added: ‘BUT, drove past the house today and it’s the first time there’s been a “sold” sign outside. ‘I can’t even believe this is mine, this was never something I thought I would be able to achieve, and I’m just sooooo bloody lucky and grateful to anyone and everyone who’s helped make my dreams come true.’ ‘Holy sh*t, I think that makes me a grown-up,’ she then joked. Shaughna, who shared her lip filler dissolving journey online earlier this year in a bid to ‘separate happiness from body image’, also posted a screenshot and link to her new home Instagram account, which she first teased in February, as she encouraged her fans to come and follow her renovation journey. ‘For anyone interested [in] watching me try to renovate my house by myself, give my home account a follow, because if there’s one thing Instagram needs more, it’s home pages…’ the influencer acknowledged, with a crying with laughter emoji. The star later shared the photo of herself outside her new property on her home account too, saying that it ‘all became very real’ when she saw the sold sign, before she started talking plans on the new account. Revealing that she hopes to move the existing staircase, ‘with hopes of having a huge staircase in the middle of the entrance’, Shaughna told her followers: ‘I’m so excited to share this chapter of my life with you, the good, the bad and the dusty 😂 ‘Until I can show you around the house, I thought I’d share some pictures from my inspo folder, I hear it’s the cheapest part of the process! 🙃’ Promising some handy budgeting tips, she added: ‘I consider my style to be a mash up of traditional X modern, I also consider myself the queen of balling on a budget, so if, like me, you are a sucker for a hack, you’ve come to the right place 😏’ Got a story?
