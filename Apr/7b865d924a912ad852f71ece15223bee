Children have been told to ‘stay at home’ amid reports of a ‘large-scale’ disorder at a funfair in London. Police have been sent to the funfair in Circus Field, Blackheath to break up the incident and the event has been shut down. Footage shared online showed large numbers of officers at the site, creating a human barrier. A helicopter could also be heard overhead. A section 60 order has been placed around Greenwich Park and Blackheath Common until 7am tomorrow morning, police said. The power allows police to stop and search anyone within the specified area. Greenwich Police said the order had been put in place following ‘a number of incidents of violence in the area’. Mathew Pennycock, Labour MP for Greenwich and Woolwich, tweeted: ‘I’m aware of the large-scale disorder taking place on Circus Field, Blackheath. ‘The police are deploying extra resource. ‘Please avoid the area. If you believe your child is at the funfair or in the area, please ask them to return home immediately.’ One person who is understood to have been at the funfair when the ‘disturbance’ occurred said they didn’t see ‘any actual violence’ but did report seeing ‘an enormous group of youths stampeding up and down the fair’. They said the group were ‘generally being a nuisance’. This is a breaking news story, more to follow soon… Check back shortly for further updates. Got a story?
