A puppy has been rescued from the rubble of a shelled village in Ukraine and returned to its elderly owner. The heartwarming rescue took place in the village of Mykhailivka, in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. The area has been heavily shelled by Vladimir Putin’s forces, which have concentrated their efforts on the east of the country in recent days. The footage of the rescue shows emergency service workers frantically digging through the rubble when they come across the pup. The rescuers managed to pull the dog out of the debris before reviving the near-dead pooch and handing it over to its concerned 77-year-old owner. It is understood the man only just survived the shelling himself and subsequently alerted emergency workers to his puppy’s plight. In a statement, Donetsk Regional Police said: ‘Every life is important – this is the slogan of the police and rescuers of Donetsk Oblast. ‘The recent shelling of Mykhailivka Village nearly killed a 77-year-old man. ‘He miraculously survived and his puppy was buried under debris and earth. ‘The elderly man was desperate to see his four-legged friend. ‘However, law enforcement officers did not give up hope of finding him, as there was a squeal – the dog was still alive. ‘Together, police and rescuers found and pulled the dog out of the ground.’ After being reunited, the man and his dog were both given medical care, police added. The State of Emergency Service of Ukraine also shared footage of the rescue saying the clip showed ‘so much life’ and ‘so much kindness and courage of those who continue to perform their duties under daily shelling’. In recent days Russia has shifted its focus to the east of Ukraine, with tens of thousands of troops and armoured vehicles seen heading towards the Donbas region. Ahead of the feared assault civilians have been urged to flee the area while they still can. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
