A ‘gentle giant’ died in the middle of a boxing match held to fundraise for charity. Dominic Chapman, 26, is believed to have trained for eight weeks so he could box to raise £400 for cancer research in a white-collar boxing match. But Dominic fell during the fight and was taken to hospital in Birmingham on Saturday night with serious injuries but later died. Friends and family have since written emotional tributes about Dominic, describing him as a ‘gentle giant’. His brother Joseph, 29, said: ‘We are utterly broken to have lost Domo. He was the kindest, friendliest and most decent human being I knew. He lit up the lives of all who were fortunate enough to have met him.’ The grieving brother continued: ‘Domo has already changed three lives through organ donation, even since leaving us. I couldn’t be prouder of him. ‘It was my privilege to be able to call him my little brother and my best mate. Rest easy, lad.’ Similarly, Dominic’s cousin said: ‘He was a friendly big giant who always had a smile on his face. rest in peace Dominic Chapman.’ One friend wrote on the JustGiving page Dominic was using to gather donations for Cancer Research UK: ‘One of the best friends I could have ever wished for. Love you Domo, hero.’ Another said: ‘The kindest, most gentle soul you could ever wish to meet, loved by all who knew him.’ The police confirmed they have no plans to investigate but the Worcestershire Regulatory Services announced it would soon launch a probe into how Dominic died at Tramps nightclub in Worcester. Dominic ended up raising £677 for cancer, which was £277 more than his target of £400. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
