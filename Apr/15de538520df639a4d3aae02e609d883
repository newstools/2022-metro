Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti is flying to London on Wednesday morning ahead of the Champions League clash with Chelsea on the same day, thanks to returning a negative Covid test result. The Italian boss had been testing positive for Covid since last week, suffering symptoms of the virus last Wednesday, and missing the league clash with Celta Vigo on Saturday. He was reportedly feeling fine again by the weekend but was still returning positive tests and he was running out of time to make the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final on Wednesday night at Stamford Bridge. However, the Spanish giants announced on Wednesday morning that the 62-year-old had finally tested negative and will be a late arrival with his squad in west London ahead of the match. A brief statement from Real Madrid on Wednesday morning read: ‘Real Madrid C.F. is pleased to announce that our coach Carlo Ancelotti has returned a negative result for COVID-19, and will therefore travel to London this morning to join up with the first team.’ Ancelotti spent two years as Chelsea manager from 2009-11, winning the Premier League and FA Cup in his brief stint in charge at Stamford Bridge. He returns to west London with fellow former Chelsea employee Thibaut Courtois, but Eden Hazard has missed out on a meeting with his old club after an operation on his leg. Real Madrid are also without Luka Jovic and Isco in their traveling squad as they look to put themselves in a good position ahead of the second leg in Spain on 12 April.
