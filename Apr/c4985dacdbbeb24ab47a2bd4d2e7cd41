While putting on a wash can be therapeutic, there is nothing more tedious than the post-folding marathon that takes place afterward. It is time consuming and often fiddly as you try to get the perfect fold. However, one woman has shared how to fold a shirt or t-shirt in just three seconds and it truly is a life and time saver. Taking to TikTok, Carolina McCauley shared her special folding technique that will make laundry folding a quick and easy experience. According to her video, the first thing you need to do is lay your t-shirt or shirt flat on a hard surface. Next, pretend there’s a horizontal line down the middle of the shirt and grab a hold of the neckline and middle of the shirt. After this, you will grab a hold of the bottom edge of the shirt with the same hand that’s holding the neck and pinch them together. Lift it up, shake it off, and lay it back down, finishing the fold. It really is that easy to have a neat folder shirt in seconds. The comment section also agreed on the simplicity of the trick. One person commented: ‘I did it! Thanks!’ While another quipped: ‘What kind of witchcraft is this?’ Meanwhile, if you are looking to cut back on clothes drying time, Caroline advises people to add a dry towel to the machine. She says this hack makes you ‘clean smarter and not harder’ as the dry towel absorbs the moisture of the wet clothes. This will then cut drying time in half. Do you have a story to share?
