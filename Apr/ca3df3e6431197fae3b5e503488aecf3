We all know that truffle is the flavour of the moment. Every boujie restaurant has dishes infused with the decadent, earthy flavour, and you can even get crisps, cheese and salt flavoured with the stuff. But one unexpected pairing is truffle and Marmite. Yes, the classic savoury spread famed for dividing consumers is launching a brand new flavour that is sure to delight some, and horrify others. Marmite Truffle is the most decadent and deluxe Marmite flavour ever, and it is set to land on shelves in Sainsbury’s on May 2nd. According to the producers, this bold new flavour is packed with a luxurious umami taste and an earthy aroma. Marmite Truffle is not just for spreading on your crumpets either, and would work to add a salty punch to stews or pasta sauces as well. But with Marmite being so famously polarising, and truffle being another strong, punchy flavour – do the two things go together? Or is it a rather unpleasant assault on the senses?
