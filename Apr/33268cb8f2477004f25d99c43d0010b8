A man sitting in his couch discovered an unwelcome visitor – a massive snake so rare it was deemed harder to find than a Rolex watch. Alex Trejo, who owns So-Cal Rattlesnake Removal, said a panic-stricken man called him to his home in Chula Vista in San Diego County. ‘This guy calls me, he’s pretty frantic, and he’s like “There’s a snake in my couch,”‘ Trejo said, according to ABC 7. Trejo, whose job it is to remove snakes, was surprised by the long reptile he encountered. ‘I literally lift the cushion and there is this giant seven-foot Vietnamese blue beauty rat snake just coiled up right behind the cushion,’ Trejo said. ‘You would be more lucky to find a Rolex sitting on the ground than you would a snake like this.’ A video of the incident showed the snake, which can grow up to eight feet long, almost biting Trejo. The species does not have venom, Trejo said, but he struggled to wrangle it for some time. ‘He didn’t get my skin, but he actually got the lining of my shirt,’ Trejo said. Trejo posted the unusual incident on his Instagram. Trejo believes the snake was someone’s pet that escaped and entered the man’s home. However, it remains unknown how the snake got there. It is legal to keep snakes as pets in California. Snakes of its kind are found in tropical weather. Since it was outside of a controlled climate for several days, the snake suffered a respiratory infection, according to Trejo. It was taken to a caretaker that knows how to tend exotic snakes. ‘I have a very good friend who deals with these exotic animals. He’s out there treating the snake right now,’ Trejo said. ‘We really are keeping our fingers crossed hoping the snake makes it.’ Meanwhile, Trejo said he is searching for the snake owner.
