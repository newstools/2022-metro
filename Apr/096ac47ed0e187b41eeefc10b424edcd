Ramadan is a holy time in the calendar for those of Muslim faith. Most notably, it’s associated with fasting – those partaking can only eat when the sun is down. But what about sex? It’s a subject that’s often seen in a more controversial light when spoken about in relation to religion, but the reality is many Muslims – regardless of their marital status – will still be sexually active during the month of Ramadan. What is and isn’t allowed is tied to fasting hours. During the fast, sex is prohibited. Once fasting finishes for the day, those things considered haram in the daylight hours are once again allowed to resume – until fasting recommences the following day. Though most time and energy should be spent on worship, Muslims are allowed to continue with their sex lives. Islam doesn’t allow for extra-marital sexual relations, so during this holy month, non-marital sex technically should be avoided even more. However, many practicing Muslims will choose to have sex more freely – just as with all religions, it is down the individual to practice what parts resonate with them. Ramadan impacts upon many aspects of a person’s life beyond what they eat. It affects their sex lives, social plans, hobbies and spending habits. The month is dedicated to worship above all else.
