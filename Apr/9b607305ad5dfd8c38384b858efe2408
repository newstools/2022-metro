Piers Morgan, who is a friend of Ronaldo’s, commented: ‘Heartbreaking news. My deepest condolences to you and all your family. 😢’ Olympic champion Usain Bolt left a string of praying-hand emoji under the footballer’s heartbreaking announcement. A message from Man U’s official Instagram account said: ‘Your pain is our pain. Sending love and strength to you and the family at this time, @Cristiano ❤️’ Likewise, a tweet from Portugal’s national football team read: ‘Muita força, capitão,’ which translates to: ‘A lot of strength, captain.’ Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake also said: ‘So sorry my friend.’ Ronaldo’s sister Katia Aveiro paid tribute to her nephew, and wrote in an Instagram post: ‘I love you and my heart is with you over there. May God take care of you and strengthen your path more and more. ‘Our angel is already on father’s lap. And our little girl is there firm and strong and full of health and is going to show us with every day that only love matters.’ In a statement, Ronaldo said: ‘It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that our baby boy has passed away. ‘It is the greatest pain that any parent can feel.’ The sports star continued: ‘Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness. ‘We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support. We are all devastated at this loss and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time.’ He added: ‘Our baby boy, you are our angel. We will always love you.’ Ronaldo, 37, and Rodriguez, 28, revealed they were expecting again in October 2021.
