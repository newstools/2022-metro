Carrie Johnson, the prime minister’s wife, has paid a fixed penalty notice for attending a birthday party for her husband in Downing Street during lockdown, a spokesperson has said. The birthday party was reportedly a surprise do for the PM, organised by Mr Johnson and held in the Cabinet Room at Downing Street on June 19 2020. Mr Johnson has also been fined for attending the event. A spokesperson for Mrs Johnson said the former Tory director of communications had paid the fine, which is understood to have been £50 if settled within 14 days. ‘Whilst she believed that she was acting in accordance with the rules at the time, Mrs Johnson accepts the Metropolitan Police’s findings and apologises unreservedly,’ her spokeswoman said. It is understood Mrs Johnson ‘briefly attended’ the Cabinet Room with their then-newborn baby, Wilfred, during the PM’s lunch break and alongside ‘some socially distanced staff’. Rishi Sunak is also understood to have been present at the event. Last year a spokesperson for Mrs Johnson told the Mirror it was ‘total nonsense’ she had held any parties in the flat. ‘Mrs Johnson has followed Covid rules at all times and it is categorically untrue to suggest otherwise,’ they said. The mum-of-two revealed she had been issued with a fine for attending a party in Downing Street during lockdown earlier today. The announcement came after No.10 said the prime minister and Mr Sunak had also been fined over ‘partygate’. A spokesperson for Mrs Johnson said: ‘In the interests of transparency, Mrs Johnson can confirm she has been notified that she will receive a Fixed Penalty Notice (FPN). ‘She has not yet received any further details about the nature of the FPN.’ Mrs Johnson was previously linked to two events held in Downing Street during lockdown.
