William Saliba believes there is ‘a chance’ that Arsenal will allow him to extend his stay at Marseille for at least another season. The 21-year-old has not made a first-team appearance for Arsenalsince his £27 million transfer from Saint-Etienne in July 2019. After being unable to impress Mikel Arteta in pre-season training last summer, Saliba joined Marseille on loan and the defender has impressed in Ligue 1 this season. Saliba’s performances also earned him a place in France’s squad in the last international break and the defender is aiming for a place in Didier Deschamps’ squad for their World Cup campaign in Qatar later this year. Arsenal have yet to make a decision over Saliba’s future and are set for talks with the defender about his future this summer. And Saliba is refusing to rule out the idea of remaining in Ligue 1 for another campaign. ‘There is always a chance,’ Saliba said in an interview with Le Parisien. ‘I do not hide that I am very happy in Marseille. ‘I have developed, I have passed a milestone. If I make it into France’s squad it’s thanks to Marseille, because there is a lot of visibility. ‘They are a very big club with a lot of pressure, but when you’re good there are a lot of good things that happen to you. ‘We will see in May or June depending on the discussions. Today, my future, I don’t know what it is.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
