The 2022 World Snooker Championship draw has been made and the top 16 players on the planet know which qualifiers they will take on at the Crucible. Defending champion Mark Selby will be in action on the opening day of the tournament against Jamie Jones in the first round as the Jester from Leicester bids for a fifth world title. Ronnie O’Sullivan is also playing on the first Saturday, with the Rocket taking on David Gilbert, as is UK Championship winner Zhao Xintong, who plays Jamie Clarke. Judd Trump is looking for a second world title but has a tough first round against Iranian debutant Hossein Vafai. Tournament favourite Neil Robertson meets another debutant in Ashley Hugill. There are three debutants in the draw this year, with Hossein Vafaei, Ashley Hugill and Jackson Page all booking their spots at the Crucible for the first time. Vafaei has not been afraid to ruffle feathers ahead of his first outing at the famous theatre, calling for Ronnie O’Sullivan to retire because he is ‘not good for the game’ after winning his final qualifier on Wednesday.
