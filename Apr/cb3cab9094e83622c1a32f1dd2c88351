Britney Spears is living her most unapologetic life. The pop singer, 40, is currently enjoying a sunny getaway and letting her hair down with closest friends. In classic Britney style, she’s also loving a naked photoshoot, and has been rolling around on the sand topless in front of holidaymakers. Britney – who recently announced a tell-all autobiography following the end of her 13-year conservatorship – has been making memories with her assistant, Vicky, with the two frolicking topless in the pool together. ‘Yep 👍🏻 … me naked in the pool and my assistant @vickyt holding me like a baby 👶🏼 !!!! BAHAHAHAHA,’ she wrote on Instagram, followed by a series of emoji. Fans were absolutely overjoyed to see the Piece Of Me hitmaker having fun, with one commenting: ‘I love that you are living your best life Britney.’ ‘This is the kind of friendship, love, care and silliness you are so worthy of,’ wrote another. Earlier in the day, the musician danced around by the sea in just her bikini bottoms, certainly giving onlookers something to stare at. But, Brit didn’t care who was watching, wearing a big smile on her face as she posed on the beach. In the video share with her 40.2million followers, Britney’s skin was noticeably red, with her fans sweetly reminding her to ‘slather on that sunscreen’ to ‘protect that gorgeous skin.’ Fans also couldn’t help but laugh at what seemed to be Britney’s security guard, who strolled around awkwardly in the background while she enjoyed a modelling sesh. ‘Lol your bodyguard in the back politely standing letting you do your thing,’ one joked. The Womanizer hitmaker has been making the most of her freedom in recent months after regaining control of her life. Amid dealing with anxiety and family feuds, the singer is supposedly working on new music after a six-year hiatus. Reportedly making the first steps towards a musical comeback, the Toxic chart-topper – whose last album was Glory in 2016 – is said to have approached collaborators including Claude Kelly, who worked with the icon on her 2008 album Circus. An inside source told The Sun: ‘It is very early days and Britney isn’t putting any pressure on herself to release an album right away or anything, but her team are putting feelers out about the prospect of new music. ‘Several people who she feels comfortable working with have been contacted and asked if they would like to work on music with Britney again and everyone seems pretty keen to be involved.’ Got a story?
