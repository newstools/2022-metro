Roy Keane hit out at three Manchester United players following their dismal defeat to rivals Liverpool, insisting Marcus Rashford ‘played like a child.’ The Red Devils suffered a 4-0 humiliation to rivals Liverpool at Anfield as Mohamed Salah (2), Luis Diaz and Sadio Mane all found the back of the net. Another lacklustre performance from United saw club legend Keane tear into his former team at full-time, taking aim at Jesse Lingard and Rashford’s efforts while also criticising captain Harry Maguire’s defending. ‘Jesse Lingard comes on,’ Keane said on Sky Sports. ‘Jesse Lingard coming on to try and save Man United, Jesse Lingard should have left Man United two years ago, he’s not good enough for Man United. ‘Rashford played like a child up front. Okay it wasn’t great service, but the one or two bits he got where he was in on goal and a poor touch. ‘Defensively, we were trying to help Maguire out here before the match, give him a little bit of PR, but the last goal, Maguire’s passing and defending, not acceptable, not good enough for Man United.’ United suffered a 5-0 defeat to Liverpool at Old Trafford earlier in the season and Keane feels it’s a long way back for his old side to be challenging for titles once again. ‘There’s no surprise at the result. Over the two games this season it’s 9-0 to Liverpool,’ he added. ‘United are so far off it – the opposite of what you want in a top team. ‘There is no leadership, no characters, no fight, no determination. It’s a long way back for this club. ‘Whatever we had when I played – that bit of pride – has gone.’ United sit sixth in the Premier League table, three points off fourth-placed Tottenham.
