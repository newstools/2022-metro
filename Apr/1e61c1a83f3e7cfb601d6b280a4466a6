Manchester United and England star Harry Maguire has vacated his home after receiving a bomb threat. Cheshire Police are searching the defender’s Alderley Edge property after he received an email claiming that a bomb would be planted at his home. Maguire lives with his fiancee Fern Hawkins, who he has two daughters with. A Manchester United spokesperson confirmed the news on Thursday afternoon, describing the event as a ‘serious threat’ to Maguire and his family. ‘In the last 24 hours, Harry [Maguire] has received a serious threat to his family home. He has reported this to the police who are now looking into the matter,’ a spokesperson said. The 29-year-old is said to be in a state of ‘extreme shock’, according to the Sun. While it’s not uncommon for Manchester United players to receive threats, Police are taking this one extremely seriously. Sniffer dogs and a host of officers were sent to Maguire’s home to investigate, with his young family understandably shaken-up after receiving the threats. Maguire’s form has nosedived this season and he’s faced heavy criticism from supporters, with many calling for him to be stripped of the captaincy. The defender was particularly poor during United’s dismal 4-0 defeat to rivals Liverpool at Anfield on Tuesday night, which saw the away fans head for the exit long before the final whistle. Maguire faces an uncertain future at Old Trafford after Erik ten Hag was named the club’s new manager this morning. The Dutchman is keen on signing a new centre-back and he wants his defence to play a high line, which Maguire struggles to do given his lack of pace.
