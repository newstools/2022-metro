Frank Lampard claims Mohamed Salah would have been awarded a penalty for the same challenge Joel Matip made on Anthony Gordon during Everton’s 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday. Goals from Andy Robertson and Divock Origi ensured that Liverpool kept pace with Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. While at the other end of the table, Everton are now two points off safety in the relegation zone after Burnley beat Wolves earlier on Sunday afternoon. Speaking after his side’s defeat, Lampard was unhappy with the decision made by referee Stuart Attwell to not award Everton a penalty after Gordon went down inside Liverpool’s area following pressure from Matip. Lampard also suggested that Liverpool continue to benefit from decisions going in their favour while they are playing at Anfield. ‘It’s a penalty in the second half for us. I don’t think you get them here,’ said Lampard. ‘If it’s Mo Salah at their end, he gets a penalty. I’m not trying to create a conflict here, it’s just the reality of football sometimes. ‘Maybe I’ve played at clubs when we’re in the top reaches of the league, the crowd is behind them and you get them or you don’t. ‘For me, for sure, it was a penalty on Anthony. It’s a foul and you don’t get them here. ‘I think they are open to it now but it is gone. It is a disappointment, in the cold light of day I think it is a penalty.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
