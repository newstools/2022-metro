Countryfile presenter Helen Skelton jetted off on holiday without her husband Richie Myler days before announcing they had split. On Monday, Helen, 38, announced she had separated from rugby player Richie, 31, after eight years of marriage. In a short Instagram statement, Helen said the sports star had ‘left the family home’ but did not provide a reason as to why the marriage broke down. Just a week ago, the TV presenter shared snaps from her sun-kissed holiday to Lanzarote where she was joined by her and Richie’s three children; Ernie, six, Louis, five, and three-month-old Elsie Kate. It appears Helen had a relaxing time as she shared photos of herself having fun in the pool with one of her sons and holding her newborn on the beach. ‘Vacay vibes …. 3 month old napping. 6 year old footballing. 5 year old needing mum. It’s a holiday 😳🤪😍☀️#holidays #needed #goodfriday #thesearethedays,’ she captioned one photo. She added alongside another: ‘Beach days … one day I will get a pic where they’re all looking.’ Julia Bradbury commented: ‘Happy times gorgeous.’ Helen later shared a photo of her posing in her two-piece bikini beside the pool next to an inflatable. ‘In reality in a pool. On telly in a lambing shed. @onthefarmc5 8pm this eve ❤️❤️ (excuse the misshapen bits that’s what babies do to you),’ she captioned the snap. The mum-of-three was cheered on by her followers and celebrity friends, including Yasmin Evans who commented: ‘Don’t you dare “excuse” your fabulous body that created beautiful humans.’ However, Richie appeared to be missing from the holiday action as he shared a photo from his training session with his rugby club Leeds Rhinos. ‘Light at the end of the tunnel,’ he wrote alongside it. It was in reference to him finally returning to the pitch after spending weeks recovering from an injury having torn his abductor muscle in a previous game in February. News of Helen and Richie’s split came as a surprise to their followers as the couple welcomed their third child at the end of December. Announcing their separation, Helen wrote in her Instagram stories: ‘Very sad to say that Richie and I are no longer a couple. He has left the family home. We will be doing our best to co parent our small children.’ Richie is yet to speak out about the split. Got a story?
