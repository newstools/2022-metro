Pep Guardiola sank to his knees after Vinicius Junior’s superb dummy against Fernandinho during Manchester City’s Champions League clash with Real Madrid on Tuesday evening. City edged out Madrid in a thrilling match at the Etihad Stadium as goals from Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus, Phil Foden and Bernardo Silva helped seal a 4-3 victory. Two goals from Karim Benzema, including a Panenka penalty, have given Madrid a lifeline ahead of the return leg next week along with Vinicius’ outstanding solo effort in the second half. The winger had a quiet game in the first half but came to life after the break and gave Fernandinho a torrid time for his goal as he dummied his fellow Brazilian in his own half before racing with the ball towards City’s goal and finishing past Ederson. And Guardiola’s reaction to the move on the touchline was priceless as the City manager had his head in his hands after Vinicius’ dummy before he collapsed to his knees as the Brazilian finished off the move. Speaking after the game, Guardiola praised Fernandinho, who was playing as a makeshift right-back following John Stones’ injury in the first half. ‘It’s not easy to control Vinicius because he is an outstanding player,’ said Guardiola. ‘But he did everything that’s why Fernandinho is such an important player. I knew it, he would perform well.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
