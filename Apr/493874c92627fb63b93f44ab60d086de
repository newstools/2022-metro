Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have released their first wedding photos and they looked radiant. The loved-up couple tied the knot in a star-studded $3million wedding on Saturday with Nicola’s billionaire parents, Nelson and Claudia, hosting the ceremony at their sprawling Palm Beach, Florida mansion. As they settled into married life, Brooklyn, 23, and Nicola, 27, shared the first set of wedding photos from their special day. One black and white shot sees the newlyweds making their debut as husband and wife at the wedding reception, with Brooklyn doing the honours of leading his smiling bride through the party. Confirming he is taking Nicola’s last name and double-barrelling with his own, the aspiring chef captioned the Instagram post: ‘Mr. & Mrs. Peltz Beckham ❤️’ Another snap from the shoot with British Vogue, shows Brooklyn suited and booted in his custom Dior wedding outfit alongside ex-footballer dad David Beckham, and his younger siblings Romeo, 19, and Cruz, 17. His little sister Harper, 10, wasn’t captured in the snaps along with mum and former Spice Girls singer Victoria. Nicola also did the big reveal by unveiling her wedding dress, a classic minimalist couture design from Valentino. Her flawless make-up was courtesy of Chanel’s Kate Lee, while her hair was preened and perfected by Adil Abergel. ‘My dream dress thank you @lesliefremar @maisonvalentino,’ Nicola captioned the post, while Brooklyn complimented his new wife, writing: ‘My beautiful bride.’ Brooklyn’s dad David seemed to be particularly emotional over his eldest child tying the knot, and wrote: ‘My beautiful boys 💙💙💙 & a very proud dad.. Congratulations Bust on a lifetime of happiness, we will always be by your side.’ Welcoming Nicola to the family, he added: ‘Congratulations Mr & Mrs Beckham ❤️ welcome to the family @nicolaannepeltz . Love you Bust.’ The wedding took place in Nicola’s family home, a sprawling $103million oceanfront mansion, where several large marquees were erected. The couple said their vows in a ceremony that honoured Nicola’s Jewish and Catholic parents. They later shared their first dance to a live rendition of Elvis Presley’s romantic classic Only Fools Rush In, before the guests partied late into Sunday morning. Celebrity guest Serena Williams revealed she was struggling to fall asleep after getting back to her room at 4am. In her Instagram stories, the tennis champion told her followers – while still glammed up nonetheless: ‘It’s so time for me to go to bed right now, I’m like, go to bed Serena, go to bed. I just need an intervention on sleep. Goodnight – or good morning!’ The wedding also offered the reunion of dreams with Spice Girls stars Mel C and Mel B in attendance to support former bandmate Victoria and her family. However, they were missing two notable figures as Geri Horner and Emma Bunton were unable to make it. Close friend of the Beckhams, Gordon Ramsay, attended the big day with his wife Tana and children Tilly and Megan. However, much to his annoyance, Tilly was in a particularly playful mood and photobombed his glamorous photo with Tana. There were reports that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were invited to the A-list occasion but the royals were a no-show. The morning after the night before, Brooklyn and Nicola headed to an intimate brunch with their parents, and the groom did the honours of whisking them away in a vintage car – coincidentally much like Meghan and Harry did on their wedding day in 2018.
