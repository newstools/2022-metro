Sarah Everard’s killer Wayne Couzens has opted for a trial by jury in a crown court to face four charges of indecent exposure. The ex-Metropolitan Police officer, 49, sported a long, bushy grey beard as he appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court this afternoon. Speaking to confirm his name and date of birth, he gave no indication of a plea in relation to alleged flashing incidents last year. It comes as he serves a whole-life sentence for the kidnap, rape and murder of marketing executive Ms Everard, 33, in March, 2021. The former cop wore a grey prison-issue grey sweater while on video link from Frankland prison, in Durham, on Wednesday. He is accused of ‘intentionally exposing his genitals intending that someone would see them and be caused alarm and distress’. The incidents are alleged to have taken place on four occasions between January 22 and February 1 2021, January 30 and February 6, on February 14 and February 27. Chief Magistrate Paul Goldspring confirmed the case was suitable for trial at the magistrates’ court. But when asked by the legal advisor where he wanted the case to be heard, Couzens replied: ‘My legal team have advised me at the Crown Court.’ It has been sent to the Old Bailey, where Couzens will next appear on May 11. Mr Goldspring said: ‘Mr Couzens, you are charged with four offences relating to Section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act. ‘You have given no indication as to plea in relation to these four matters. ‘I determined that on their own, without what we know happened subsequently, they would be suitable for trial in this court. ‘As is your right, you have elected Crown Court trial.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
