Andy Robertson shrugged off being targeted with objects including lighters by Benfica fans following Liverpool’s win in Lisbon, joking: ‘Maybe it will help them stop smoking!’ Liverpool secured a 3-1 win at the Sadio da Luz to take control of their quarter-final tie at the halfway stage with Ibrahima Konate, Sadio Mane and Luis Diaz all on the score sheet. During the final stages of the game, home supporters hurled projectiles in the direction of Robertson as he lined up a late corner kick. Reacting to the incident, Robertson told BT Sport: ‘They weren’t best pleased were they? ‘I had quite a few lighters thrown at me so maybe it’ll help them stop smoking! Take the positives. ‘We’ve seen it a lot with people getting hit, things like that. Luckily, they were all quite close to me but none of them hit me. ‘They’re frustrated, I get that, but you should try and not throw stuff onto the pitch because it can hurt people. I was just trying to take the corner and get out of there as quickly as possible.’ Liverpool take a commanding lead with them back to Anfield next week with Robertson warning there is still work to be done. ‘Next week, it’s still a big game,’ Robertson said. ‘We want to be in the semi-final and we’ve still got a lot of work to get there. ‘But with our fans at our stadium, we can hopefully get the job done.’ MORE : Michael Owen predicts Jurgen Klopp will drop Luis Diaz for Liverpool’s pivotal clash against Man City this weekend MORE : Owen Hargreaves says Phil Foden is the ‘most unique footballer’ after Manchester City’s win over Atletico Madrid For more stories like this, check our sport page.
