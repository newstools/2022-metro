Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash’s wedding is just three months away and the Loose Women panellist officially has a dress. The adorable couple got engaged on Christmas Eve in 2020 but postponed their big day both due to the pandemic and so all of their children could be present. Stacey gave birth to her first daughter Rose on her 32nd birthday, with the couple also sharing two-year-old son Rex. The X Factor star also shares son Zachary, 14, with her ex Dean Cox and nine-year-old Leighton with ex-fiancé Aaron Barnham. Stacey has been planning her nuptials to to EastEnders actor for a while, and recently gave a glimpse at the dreamy aisle she’s set to walk down. Marking another milestone today, she shared her excitement after going wedding dress shopping, taking to Instagram to document the feeling she ‘never wants to forget.’ Sharing a couple of mirror selfies of one of the dresses, which Stacey clarifies isn’t the one, she wrote: ‘I’ve been putting it off I think because the more I got excited about it the more silly I felt for some reason… I started feeling really conscious about not being, well I don’t know, a young virgin bride 😂🙈 I know that’s ridiculous because I wouldn’t have done life any other way EVER.’ Stacey continued: ‘I’m so grateful for how it turned out and I genuinely believe everything happens for a reason. But I suppose sometimes those old fashioned narratives make you feel that way don’t they? 🙈 ‘I decided to try my dresses on, at home with just me not making a “thing” of it. But it turns out it felt like the hugest “thing” ever 😭 My sister dropped the kids back from school and popped up and we both ended up emotional messes 😂’ The TV presenter expressed how she ‘loved every single second of today,’ trying on dresses and ‘imagining seeing Joe for the first time, feeling the veil on my shoulders and seeing the glitter sparkle as I moved around.’ ‘I took this picture to remember how excited I felt today,’ she concluded, referencing the beaming snaps which also show her mum bursting with happiness and cuddling up to the bride-to-be. ‘And no matter who, how or what way around you do it, it’s the most special moment ever.’ Stacey’s 5.1million followers flooded her comments section with excitement over her upcoming big day, with famous pals also wishing her well. ‘Awww congratulations beautiful girl 😍’ wrote Vicky Pattison. The former King and Queen of the Jungle will tie the knot in the gardens of their beloved Pickle Cottage, with preparations for catering and floristry well underway. Got a story?
