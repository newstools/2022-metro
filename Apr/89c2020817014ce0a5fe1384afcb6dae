Jesse Lingard has told Paul Scholes that the current Manchester United dressing room is ‘a disaster’. United slumped to another defeat on Saturday afternoon with a 3-1 loss at Arsenal all but ending their hopes of qualifying for next season’s Champions League. Erik ten Hag was officially unveiled as the club’s new manager this week with the Dutchman set to arrive from Ajax at the end of the season. With a number of players out of contract and major concerns at the club on and off the pitch, the 52-year-old will have a huge job on his hands. And United legend Scholes, speaking after the defeat to the Gunners, revealed he has recently spoken to Lingard who offered a bleak insight into just how bad the current situation is. ‘I had a quick chat With Jesse [Lingard] the other day,’ Scholes told DAZN. ‘I’m sure he won’t mind be saying – that dressing room is a disaster.’ Interim boss Ralf Rangnick was quizzed on the comments post-match, telling reporters: ‘I don’t know, you have to ask Jesse Lingard. ‘Obviously, after games like today, there is massive disappointment in the locker room. This is, for me, normal. ‘I think the whole group get on reasonably with each other, I’m not daring to say get on well, but I don’t see there is an issue with the atmosphere in the locker room.’ MORE : Ralf Rangnick explains why Cristiano Ronaldo didn’t take Man Utd penalty vs Arsenal MORE : Granit Xhaka sends warning to Arsenal teammates after Manchester United victory For more stories like this, check our sport page.
