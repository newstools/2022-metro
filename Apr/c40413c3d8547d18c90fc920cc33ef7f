Kieran Tierney has been ruled out of Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Crystal Palace on Monday evening due to a knee injury. The left-back played a full game in both of Scotland’s fixtures during the international break. But he has not been named in Mikel Arteta’s matchday squad for the Gunners’ trip to Selhurst Park. When asked about the extent of Tierney’s knee injury, Arteta said before the game: ‘We don’t know. ‘He came back from international duty and he felt something wrong in his knee. We scanned it and there is some damage there. ‘He’s seeing the specialist on Tuesday and hopefully we will know more but it’s not looking good.’ Nuno Tavares has been brought in to cover Tierney at left-back. Meanwhile, Nicolas Pepe is also absent due to illness, while Takehiro Tomiyasu continues to miss out due to a calf problem. Elsewhere, Aaron Ramsdale returns to the starting XI after recovering from a hip problem, while Bukayo Saka also starts after recovering from Covid. Arsenal currently sit fifth in the Premier League but a win or a draw against Palace would put Arteta’s side back into fourth spot. The Gunners will also still have a game in hand over Tottenham after tonight’s fixture Palace, meanwhile, could move up to ninth in the table if they beat Arsenal.
