A huge quantity of fuel worth quarter of a million pounds was stolen from under the nose of the Royal Navy. Diesel which was meant to power HMS Bulwark, a 19,500-tonne assault ship, was siphoned off by thieves. The heist went on over several weeks last year at HMNB Devonport in Plymouth and was almost not detected at all, according to reports. Navy bosses finally became aware of the scam after civilian security guards preformed a spot check on a tanker leaving the base. The Sun said the £250,000 quantity of fuel belonged to contractor Babcock International and was used to power generators fitted to the warship. An urgent investigation is under way to find out how the security lapse was allowed to occur on a high-security military base. Fuel theft for sale on the black market is a global problem at commercial ports but the setting for this crime raises the severity. Luke Pollard, a Labour MP in Plymouth, told the paper the incident ‘takes scarce resources away from our military in a time of national crisis’. He added: ‘With the armed forces facing more and more cuts, having such a huge amount of fuel stolen is not only embarrassing, but it also raises serious questions about security at one of our most secure naval bases.’ HMNB Devonport is the largest base of its kind in Western Europe and is used to maintain Britain’s nuclear-powered submarines. The secure facility is home to some of the Royal Navy’s most prized assets, including a fleet of frigates. HMS Bulwark, one of two British ships capable of rapidly deploying troops, is undergoing a refit at the base. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ‘The Ministry of Defence is aware of an incident last year involving the alleged theft of fuel from a contractor within HMNB Devonport. ‘There was no disruption to defence operations and the Ministry of Defence has no further comment.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
