A beachgoer was horrified to see a group of children throwing stones at a seal as it emerged from the water. The animal had plopped itself onto the beach for a rest in Hornsea, East Yorkshire, only it for it to be harassed by the group. A woman named Donna, who was out for a swim on Monday when she saw the upsetting incident, said the children were aged around 12. They got a telling off, but then a woman came over and grabbed the seal by its tail and tried to fling it back in the sea, the shocked witness told HullLive. ‘The seal went for this lady. All it wanted to do was rest but everyone wanted a close up picture and were surrounding it and it wasn’t able to rest and it was getting very distressed,’ said Donna. Eventually British Divers Marine Life Rescue were called and took the seal away so it could have a proper rest. ‘What is wrong with people? If you see a seal leave it alone, don’t touch it, don’t let your dogs go near and most definitely do not throw stones at it,’ Donna added. ‘It should have been able to rest there on its own accord but unfortunately it was at risk of idiots.’ Coastguard teams have urged members of the public to leave seals alone on the coast. They say more of them have been spotted on beaches, meaning they’ve had an increase in calls from people who mistakenly think they’ve been ‘stranded’, when actually they’re just resting. People who see an injured seal – not just one that’s on land – should call HM Coastguard or British Divers Marine Life Rescue. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
