Chris Rock’s brother Tony has joked about Will Smith’s behaviour at the Oscars, after the actor slapped the comedian in response to a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith. Former Saturday Night Live star Chris had mentioned Jada’s short haircut – with the actress previously revealing she shaved her head amid her struggle with alopecia – and said he was amped for GI Jane 2, before 53-year-old Will stormed the stage and slapped the presenter. After sharing on his Twitter he ‘didn’t accept’ Will’s apology to his brother, after the Oscar winner insisted he was a ‘work in progress’ in an emotional statement, Tony Rock unleashed on the star during a comedy set on the weekend. In a video clip obtained by The Shade Room, Tony – one of Chris’ six siblings, and also a comedian – quipped during a recent set: ‘If you think you gonna walk up on this stage, this ain’t the mother******* Oscars. ‘And if you walk your a** up here, you ain’t nominated for s*** but these mother******* hands. Oh, we going to pop the rest of the year. ‘Every time you see me do a show, pop!’ While Tony admitted he didn’t really want to open his own show by addressing the controversial incident, he added: ‘You gonna hit my mother******** brother because your b**** gave you a side-eye?’ Will previously shared a lengthy apology to Chris, who mentioned the event in passing as he returned to the stage last week, conceding that his behaviour was ‘unacceptable and inexcusable’ before resigning from the Academy. His statement read: ‘I betrayed the trust of the Academy. I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken.’ Will added that ‘the list of those I have hurt is long and includes Chris, his family, many of my dear friends and loved ones, all those in attendance, and global audiences at home’. The Academy accepted his resignation, with Will saying that he ‘will accept any further consequences the Board deems appropriate’. The Hollywood star – who won the best actor gong for his role in King Richard not long after slapping Chris – previously publicly apologised to the comedian, writing on his Instagram in part: ‘Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive. My behavior at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable. Jokes at my expense are a part of the job, but a joke about Jada’s medical condition was too much for me to bear and I reacted emotionally. ‘I would like to publicly apologize to you, Chris. I was out of line and I was wrong. I am embarrassed and my actions were not indicative of the man I want to be. There is no place for violence in a world of love and kindness. [sic]’ During a recent Twitter Q&A, Tony was asked whether he accepted Will’s apology, to which the comedian simply replied: ‘No.’ Happily answering several questions in regards to the incident, when one enquired ‘Who you think hits harder Will or Jada boyfriend?’ Tony replied: ‘Mama Rock,’ before he shared how his brother was after the ceremony. According to Tony: ‘Still rich.’ MORE : Grammys 2022: Trevor Noah takes cheeky swipe at Will Smith over shocking Chris Rock slap MORE : Grammys 2022: Justin and Hailey Bieber, Paris Hilton and Chrissy Teigen and John Legend lead loved-up stars with major PDA on red carpet Got a story?
