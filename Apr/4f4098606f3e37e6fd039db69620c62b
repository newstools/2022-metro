A British diver has been pictured in hospital surrounded by flowers three days after going missing in Malaysian waters. Heavily sunburnt Adrian Chesters, 46, is now recovering in intensive care after his terrifying ordeal. He had been diving with his 14-year-old son Nathen, instructor Kristine Grodem and 18-year-old Alexia Molina, on Wednesday, when they were ‘abandoned’ by their ship’s ‘meth-taking’ captain. Mr Chesters was saved by fishermen but Nathen remains missing and is feared dead. He told investigators his Anglo-Dutch son was ‘too weak’ and did not survive the  diving expedition. Yesterday, Mr Chesters and Miss Molina were visited in hospital by representatives from Malaysia’s Sultan of Johor and were presented with flowers and gifts. Ms Grodem, who was found on Thursday, told rescuers she had been separated from the others by strong currents. The group had been diving together in waters around 50-feet deep, off the island of Pulau Tokong Sanggol. They surfaced after 40 minutes and realised their boat had vanished. The ship’s captain was later arrested by the authorities and tested positive for amphetamines. A huge rescue mission was launched, but Malaysian investigators say there is a ‘high likelihood’ the search Nathen will need to be broadened. Police chief Cyril Edward Nuing said: ‘We believe there is a high likelihood that he [Nathen] is no longer in Malaysian waters, based on the movement of sea currents, as well as the time and location where the other victims were found.’ Yesterday, relatives of Mr Chesters declined to comment on the tragedy. Diving activities off the coast of Mersing, where there are several popular diving locations, have been suspended since the incident. The tragic incident came just days after Malaysia reopened its border to foreign nationals on April 1. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
