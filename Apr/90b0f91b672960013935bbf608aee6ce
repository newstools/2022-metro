A murder investigation has been opened in southwest France after the bodies of a British couple were found at their isolated countryside home. An unnamed woman was found dead with a rope around her neck by concerned friends who went to the pair’s house in Boudrac after not hearing from them for at least three days. Local prosecutor Christophe Amunzateguy said: ‘Wounds were also found on her body – there were signs of strangulation and blows.’ Her husband was found by police hanged in an outhouse with a note next to him. Confirming that a murder investigation had been opened, Mr Amunzateguy, the public prosecutor in Saint-Gaudens, said ‘there was no evidence of a third party being involved.’ The couple bought their house early last year and had wanted to open a guesthouse. They never achieved their goal after being plunged into financial difficulty. Autopsies will take place on Tuesday to try and establish a cause of death. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ‘Our consular staff are available to support British nationals 24/7. We have nothing further to add at this stage.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
