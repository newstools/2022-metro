Jurgen Klopp insists Liverpool’s players expected Jordan Pickford’s timewasting tactics following their 2-0 win over Everton on Sunday. Klopp’s side struggled to get going in the first half as Everton frustrated their Merseyside rivals with a combative performance. But the Premier League title chasers improved after the break and goals from Andy Robertson and Divock Origi ensured that they kept pace with Manchester City at the top of the table. In the closing stages of the first half, Pickford wound up Liverpool supporters as he made a routine catch before dropping to the floor and smiling. And Klopp admits his Liverpool players struggled to cope with Everton’s stifling tactics in the opening 45 minutes. ‘Obviously, thank god the game has two halves,’ Klopp told BBC Sport. ‘We didn’t play particularly well in the first half. They made it uncomfortable with the formation they have but we didn’t get in behind the last line. We didn’t have enough movement. ‘We weren’t quick enough. We passed the ball into the area they had nine players, lost balls, the counters, all these kind of things. Second half we were much more direct and caused them much more problems. The goals were wonderful.’ When asked about Everton’s tactics, Klopp replied: ‘Yes, of course we expected it but we didn’t react extremely well. ‘It’s difficult, each ball Pickford has he takes five minutes so we couldn’t gain rhythm, which is important you want to break down a low block. ‘That’s what we expected them to do it, we just should’ve coped better with it. ‘The amount of wins we’ve had in recent months is insane. You have to work. The boys did that again. I’m really happy. ‘We stayed really cool and calm. The changes helped, Fresh players, different formation. It made it difficult for the opposition. ‘We won 2-0, it’s absolutely fine.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
