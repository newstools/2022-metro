Doctor Who fans have been longing for a romance between the Time Lord and Yaz and the ‘flirty’ tension became almost unbearable in Legend of the Sea Devils. The episode marked Jodie Whittaker’s penultimate episode as the Doctor, with her final outing scheduled for autumn, before her regeneration into the 14th Doctor. BBC aired a pirate extravaganza for this year’s Easter special, which the team hitting the deck and fighting with swords on a pirate ship. A scene that stood out to many viewers, however, was the Doctor and Yaz’s underwater adventure. As the Doctor (Jodie) and Yaz (Mandip Gill) wandered off a couple of centuries while Dan (John Bishop) did some exploring of his own, viewers were practically screaming at their screens. The pair travelled to the bottom of the ocean in the TARDIS, with the Doctor joking to her companion: ‘Not a bad date, am I?’ Sure enough, this line alone sent viewers into a frenzy, as did the facial expressions of longing from both characters. ‘Thasmin having a moment omg my hearttt 🥺,’ one fan tweeted. ‘Just kiss for god’s sake,’ demanded another, as the characters were ‘so close yet so far’ from one another. ‘The Doctor and Yaz are very close, flirty and touchy feely in this episode 😍,’ one Twitter user pointed out. Later on in the episode, the two finally addressed a budding romance for the first time, with the Doctor admitting to her companion that ‘if it was going to be anyone, it’d be you’. ‘You know what I said earlier about not being a bad date? Well, dating’s not something I really do. I mean, I used to, I have done, and if I was going to, believe me, it would be with you,’ she said. ‘You’re one of the greatest people I’ve ever known,’ the Doctor told Yaz, with the  two standing in silence for a moment, staring into one another’s eyes. Bringing them back down to Earth, the Doctor broke the silence: ‘Including my wife… it was a long time ago, I was a different man back then, but the point is, if it was going to be anyone, it’d be you. But I can’t.’ When asked by Yaz, ‘Why not?’ the Time Lord replied: ‘Because, at some point, time always runs out.’ By this point, viewers were ‘shaking, crying and throwing up’ as the Doctor finally got real about her true feelings. The cherry on top of the cake, though, was the Doctor’s emotional line at the end of the episode, as Yaz handed her a pebble to make a wish with as it skimmed across the water. ‘I wish this would go on forever,’ Jodie’s character said, while gazing into Yaz’s eyes. ‘Thirteen confessing her love first for Yaz is something I have waited for years 😭,’ one fan tweeted. Another wrote: ‘The Thasmin content has me crying. I can’t breathe I can’t cope. #Thasmin is EVERYTHING.’ Not everyone felt so fulfilled come the end of the special, though, with some fans ‘disappointed’ that the two didn’t kiss or even hug. ‘So they didn’t get together, there wasn’t a love declaration, the Doctor said she would date Yaz but she cant so that hurt and I thought they might have kissed but no and not even a hug. We had so much hope for this episode and yet I feel let down,’ tweeted one sad fan. Tasmin shippers will have to wait a while longer to see how their relationship ends, as Jodie prepares to bow out and have another actor take her place. Speculation remains rife around who will step into the TARDIS as the 14th Doctor, with the likes of Olly Alexander, Lydia West, and even Hugh Grant being thrown around as possibilities. Got a story?
