The Queen has paid a heartfelt tribute to her husband of 73 years, Prince Philip, on the first anniversary of his death. April 9 marked one year since the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh, who was just a few months from celebrating his 100th birthday. In an emotional post on social media, the Royal Family shared a touching spoken poem over a video montage highlighting his long life and his achievements in the British military. It included an old photo of the prince smiling while leaning over the Queen’s shoulder. ‘Remembering His Royal Highness The Duke of Edinburgh on the first anniversary of his death,’ the caption said. Her Majesty and the rest of the Royal Family mourned privately after the grand Service of Thanksgiving for Philip at Westminster Abbey on Tuesday last week. They were joined at the memorial by 1,800 mourners, many of whom were representatives of charities the duke was patron of. It looked very different to his funeral last year where only 30 people were allowed to attend due to ongoing Covid-19 restrictions. A heartbreaking image showed the Queen forced to sit by herself inside the church. Royal expert Phil Dampier said the duke ‘would have told the Queen to enjoy the time that is left to her’, rather than mourn for the rest of her life. He told FEMAIL: ‘To cope with her grief while also having to deal with the fallout from the Prince Andrew sex scandal, Harry and Meghan’s shenanigans and Prince Charles’s cash for donors problems show what an extraordinary woman she is. ‘We were already used to seeing her on royal jobs without him as he had retired three years earlier. ‘But behind the scenes he was still supporting her and she would have felt his loss immensely.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
