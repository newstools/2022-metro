A convicted romance fraudster who used dating sites to dupe women out of thousands of pounds is back behind bars for four years. Frank Adozi used a fake name and profile and tricked one ‘vulnerable’ woman out of more than £157,000. He used his ill-gotten gains to fund an exotic lifestyle, buying designer clothes, a high-end Range Rover and large amounts of jewellery. His victim said the 32-year-old, who claimed he was 60, ‘came across as a nice family man who was down-to-earth and genuine’. Adozi told her he worked on an oil rig and had taken the wrong bank card with him. His victim sent him 34 transactions over two months before she became suspicious in May 2021 when he said he was on a flight to Dubai that did not exist. When police checked his mobile phone after a traffic stop in January, they found he had conned at least six other women out of almost £3,000 in total. Adozi, of Nottingham, pleaded guilty to false representation when he appeared at the city’s crown court. He had previously served four and a half years for similar offences and was released from prison in 2020. Detective constable Carl Miller, of Nottinghamshire Police’s fraud investigation team, said: ‘Adozi had no regard for his victims. ‘He went to great lengths to build rapport and gain their trust, before fabricating stories to exploit them out of thousands.’ Several so-called Tinder Swindlers – a term used to describe romance fraudsters who use dating apps to con people out of money – have come to light after the release of a true-crime documentary on Netflix which tells the story of Simon Leviev and how he conned multiple women by pretending to be a rich diamond mogul.
