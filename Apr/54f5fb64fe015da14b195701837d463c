A warning has been issued after a group of men in a white van targeted children in Newcastle. One young person was offered a lift amid a ‘number’ of incidents in the Wolstanton area. Another child was left ‘upset and frightened’ on their way to school as the men approached them while ‘wearing clown masks’. Parents at St John Fisher Catholic College have been told to remain alert as police investigate. All sightings over the Easter holidays should be reported to Staffordshire Police. Stoke Sentinel reports a letter to parents from the school’s headteacher Garrett Murray reads: ‘Local police will patrol around the location throughout the day. ‘I am asking learners, parents and carers to be vigilant and to report any concerns to Staffordshire Police on 101 or via the Staffordshire Police website or Facebook page. ‘Any descriptions or identifying markers such as vehicle registration plates would be extremely useful in helping the police with their enquiries.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
