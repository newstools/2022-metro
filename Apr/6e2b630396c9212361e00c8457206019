A driver who killed one passenger and seriously injured another while doing more than four times the speed limit has been jailed. Vinit Patel, 30, had been driving at around 120mph in a 30mph zone before the Seat Leon Cupra smashed into a tree in Leicester last January. The impact of the crash ripped the car in two, with the back-seat passenger, a man in his 20s who owned the vehicle, dying at the scene. Patel and his front-seat passenger, 40, were both found unconscious and rushed to hospital. The surviving passenger suffered broken ribs and a facial fracture which required three metal plates to be inserted, as well as a fracture to his lower back. Patel was eventually discharged in March 2021 and interviewed by police the following month. Patel, from Leicester, admitted causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving at the city’s crown court and was jailed for five years and two months on Friday. Toxicology reports confirmed he was also over the legal alcohol limit at the time of the collision. Patel was also disqualified from driving for eight years and must sit an extended test when re-applying for his licence. Detective Sergeant Paul Hawkins said: ‘It’s difficult to comprehend the speed at which Patel was driving. ‘He was in a lit, residential area where the limit is 30mph, but was travelling at more than four times that. ‘He didn’t care for the safety of his passengers – or those living in the area – and had complete disregard for them. ‘Sadly, the recklessness of his driving resulted in the most serious of consequences. ‘While in prison, I hope Patel takes time to reflect on the devastation he has caused and my heartfelt condolences remain with the family of the passenger who lost his life.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
