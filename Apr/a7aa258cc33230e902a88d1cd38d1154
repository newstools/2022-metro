A huge, virtually untouched mansion dating back to the early 1900s has been put up for sale. The luxurious New York property is a veritable time capsule, with most of its original features remaining in all their glory. Built between 1901 and 1903, the home is situated in the city’s Murray Hill neighbourhood and is priced at a tidy $33,000,000. The property has only been owned by two families over the last century, and offers new owners the chance to own a real piece of history. Arranged over eight floors, the twelve-bedroom, nine-bathroom mansion is 33 ft wide and has 11,367 sq ft of space. It’s equipped with a cellar, gym and sunken hot tub, as well as a massive kitchen and a courtyard. A mahogany staircase and elevator can take you to all of the floors, and a service staircase takes you to the basement. The building offers great views of the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings. There’s also a high-tech security system installed along with smart-home automation and a temperature-controlled wine cellar. Interested? The property is being listed by Edward F. Joseph at Christie’s International Real Estate. Do you have a story to share?
