If there is someone’s style we are always trying to emulate, it’s the French girl. Chic, understated and effortless, it has become the basis for many women’s wardrobes. The reason for this is how beautifully simple it is. There are no bells and whistles, scary prints or clashing colours – everything is muted yet sexy. All the pieces a French woman owns are classics: meant to be kept, worn and cherished forever. There is nothing trend-led about any of the garments. Some key items to have include a great structured blazer, a fantastic pair of jeans and a solid white shirt. From there you have your base. You can then introduce pops of colour like French women do, through your bags and accessories. Meanwhile, you should always have a pair of ballet flats in your arsenal. So to get you started on your French girl journey, here are 11 pieces that will help you nail the look. Get it for £159 at Djerf Avenue. Get it for £65 at & Other Stories.
