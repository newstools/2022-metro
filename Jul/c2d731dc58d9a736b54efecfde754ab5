Amazing footage has revealed the rare moment a pair of newborn twins are delivered while still inside their amniotic sacs in Brazil. Fewer than one in 80,000 babies are born ‘en caul’ – when the balloon of protective membrane that surrounds a foetus during pregnancy remains unbroken. The sac usually breaks at the beginning of labour. But in this case, doctors had to open the sacs with their hands. The twins’ mother, Cristiane Mucci, gave birth to daughters Maria Cecilia and Maria Alice via Caesarean section on June 11. The infants broke through their sacs as medics tried to release them at the Hospital de Nossa Senhora das Dores in Ponte Nova, a municipality in Minas Gerais state, south-eastern Brazil. They were delivered by gynaecologist and obstetrician Dr Emilio Garavini and were both fit and healthy, with the hospital describing the birth as ‘different and special’. The hospital said in a statement: ‘On 11th June, two twins came into the world in the maternity ward of the Hospital de Nossa Senhora das Dores. ‘Cristiane Mucci gave birth to little ones Maria Cecilia and Maria Alice Mucci. ‘However, this birth was different and special: the babies were born en caul, i.e. still inside the amniotic sac that protects the baby during pregnancy.’ Despite cases being rare, this is thought to be the fifth en caul birth in Brazil. A clinic in Sao Miguel do Oeste welcomed baby Davi Lucca Rosset Basso to the world in September last year. The Sun reported the unnamed doctor who delivered the infant said: ‘It’s a very beautiful birth, the baby arriving inside the sac and still moving around. ‘Practically still in the intrauterine environment. Still in contact with its mother. It’s a very emotional birth.’ Birth photographer Vanuza Lolatto posted pictures of the baby’s arrival on her Instagram page, together with the caption ‘a true little bundle of love’.
