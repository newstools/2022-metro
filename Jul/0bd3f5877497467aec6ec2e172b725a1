A star of Benidorm – Sticky Vicky – was rushed to hospital after smashing her knees getting into a car. The 79-year-old is known for her X-rated magic shows in the Spanish resort popular with Brit holidaymakers. Vicky – real name Victoria Aragues Gadea – spent five days in hospital, where she had staples inserted into her knees, before she was discharged. But she was still in pain after returning home, and one leg became infected so she had to go back for treatment. Get well messages flooded in from fans around the world, with Claire Tucker saying: ‘Nasty injury Please take care and get well soon.’ Denise Gunshorn added: ‘Oh my God, that was some fall. I hope you get better soon.’ Dina Toll said: ‘Get well soon and have a speedy recovery.’ Vicky spent 35 years entertaining millions of tourists with her saucy routine. It included pulling objects – like ping pong balls and beer bottles – from inside her body. She retired in 2016 aged 72. An estimated six million people have seen her show since she started it in the mid-70s. Her daughter Maria Gadea Aragues has since taken over her mum’s saucy routine.
