Barron Trump made a rare public appearance at Ivana Trump’s funeral last night. Melania’s son, who stands at well over 6ft tall, appeared alongside various relations to pay their respects to his father Donald’s first wife. The former President’s youngest son’s exact height is not known, but is said to be between 6ft 2 and 6 ft 7. Ivana, a 1980s style icon and businesswoman, helped his father build the Trump business empire. Donald Trump said she lived a ‘beautiful life’ ahead of the ceremony at a Manhattan church attended by all of his children, an array of other relatives and friends. Former first lady Melania and their 16-year-old son headed to St. Vincent Ferrer Roman Catholic Church, a few blocks from Ivana’s home near Central Park, New York. Ivana and Donald Trump were married from 1977 to 1992. Their three children — Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric — also stood with their father to watch the gold-toned casket carried from the church. Eric briefly put an arm around his sister’s shoulders, while she held the hand of one of her small children, who clutched a red flower. Trump’s family announced last Thursday that the 73-year-old had died at her home. Authorities said the death was an accident, with blunt impact injuries to her torso as the cause. In the 1980s, Ivana became well known in her own right, instantly recognisable with her for her glamorous look and blonde hair. Though she and Mr Trump had a very public and ugly divorce, they were on friendly terms in recent years and she enthusiastically supported his presidential campaign.
