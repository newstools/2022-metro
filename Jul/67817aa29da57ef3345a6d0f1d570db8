BBC Breakfast presenter Jon Kay is ‘gutted’ after being forced to miss his first day as a permanent presenter due to Covid. The 52-year-old was confirmed as Dan Walker’s replacement just last week, but couldn’t join Sally Nugent on Monday’s show. Instead, Nugent – who replaced Louise Minchin as permanent host in 2021 – was joined by Nina Warhurst. Alongside a picture of his positive lateral flow test, Kay tweeted: ‘Aaaagh! Finally got me Gutted not to be able to start the new job officially @BBCBreakfast on Monday.’ Turning to BBC Breakfast editor Richard Frediani, he teased: ‘I guess working from home isn’t really an option?’ Plenty of fans rushed to send their condolences, including his predecessor Walker who tweeted: ‘Oh no Jon! Hope you feel ok.’ Kay’s BBC Breakfast co-host Naga Munchetty added: ‘Argh! Hope you’re not feeling too poorly x.’ Kay was finally able to announce his new job on Friday, alongside Victoria Derbyshire who was also confirmed to be replacing Emily Maitlis on Newsnight. Sharing the good news, he said: ‘I’m looking forward to bringing our brilliant viewers the very latest news each morning alongside my good friend Sally and the rest of the team. ‘Sitting on the famous red sofa is a real privilege while covering the stories and issues that matter to our audience – home and abroad.’ BBC Breakfast airs weekdays at 6am on BBC One.
