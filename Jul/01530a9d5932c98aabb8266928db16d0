A pie-loving dad is ‘sticking to salads’ from now on after finding a tooth in his Fray Bentos. Adam Young, 36, was tucking into the minced beef and onion pie when he felt something ‘really hard’. ‘It was like crunching a stone,’ he said. ‘But when I spat it out onto my plate I could see it was a tooth. ‘The first thing I did was double-check my own teeth, but they were all intact. ‘I’ve looked on the internet and I think it might be from a young cow. I certainly didn’t expect to find anything like that in my pie.’ The part-time weatherman, who bought the pie at a corner shop in Sheerness, Kent, immediately contacted the food firm hoping they would get to the root of the problem. He added: ‘I wanted to warn them in case they needed to take all their other tins off the shelves. ‘I don’t want anyone else finding a tooth. They might choke on it and die. ‘I was thinking of putting it under my pillow to see what the tooth fairy might bring me, but from now on, I’m sticking with salads.’ The pies are made by Baxters Food Group, which boasts: ‘Local sourcing has always been a key ingredient in our recipe for success.’ In April, it had to recall Fray Bentos Just Chicken pies because they may have contained small pieces of plastic. Back in 2012, a Scottish woman also reported finding a tooth in a Fray Bentos pie. A Fray Bentos spokeswoman said: ‘Quality is extremely important to us and we take all customer concerns seriously. ‘We can confirm that we have been in contact with Mr Young and have requested that some details along with the foreign object be sent to us to ensure we can investigate this matter thoroughly.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
