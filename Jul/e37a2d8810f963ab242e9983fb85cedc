 A lot has been said about Boris Johnson over the past two days. But taking the biscuit for a statement most detached from reality is surely Jacob Rees-Mogg. On Tuesday evening, as the Government descended into freefall, the Brexit minister appeared on Sky News to defend the beleaguered Prime Minister. Political editor Beth Rigby rightly asked him how long Mr Johnson could remain in office after the bombshell resignations of his Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid. ‘I’m going for Walpole. Walpole did 21 years, and I’d like to see the Prime Minister do better than Walpole,’ Mr Rees-Mogg replied. Robert Walpole’s premiership lasted for two decades in the, err, 1700s. With the benefit of hindsight, Mr Rees-Mogg may come to regret that prediction considering the slow-motion car crash that followed. Mr Johnson has endured more than 50 Government resignations – the most for any sitting PM – and he was even stabbed in the back by the Chancellor he appointed two days ago. Nadhim Zahawi arguably delivered the final nail in the coffin with his blistering statement telling him to resign this morning. It appears the PM finally got the message and is expected to resign at midday outside 10 Downing Street. The PM refused to budge last night despite a face-off with his own Cabinet members, who told him he had lost the confidence of the Tory party and could not continue any longer. Mr Johnson lashed out by sacking Michael Gove and even pledged a new economic programme – even though he’d struggle to implement anything without any ministers in office. He is now set to become the third Conservative PM brought down by Tory infighting in the space of six years. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
