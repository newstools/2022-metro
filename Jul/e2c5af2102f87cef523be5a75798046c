The boy suffered deep cuts and wounds to his body and face as a result of the attack. Eyewitness Aijaz Ahmed said: ‘We heard cries of the minor before the beast was chased by the locals. The leopard has dragged him into the woods for more than 500 metres. Following the incident, the locals are living in a constant state of fear.’ Locals have been warned by wildlife officials and authorities to be aware of other leopard attacks in the area.
