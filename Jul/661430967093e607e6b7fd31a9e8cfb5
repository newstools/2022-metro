A gym owner is ‘traumatised’ after he was called horrific racist slurs in letters from the DVLA. Marvin Greaves, 40, does not own a car or have a vehicle, but received a logbook from the licensing agency on Wednesday. The mysterious letter named the dad-of-six’s surname as ‘Black N****r Pussy’. The next day, he received another letter calling him ‘Marvin Chocolate N****r Greaves’. Marvin, who helps keep young people off the streets and in the gym in Oldham, Greater Manchester, was ‘stressed and depressed’ following his ordeal. ‘It was an official letter, brown envelope, and it came to my gym address,’ he said. ‘It’s definitely racist and somebody has authorised that for it to be sent to my gym address. ‘I was wondering how it could even be sent out. Even if someone’s done it online, someone’s got to authorise it.’ The DVLA said: ‘These malicious and fraudulent applications were made by an as yet unknown third party and we have removed this information from our records. We are urgently investigating and will pass our findings onto the police.’ Marvin claims the DVLA worker he reported it to asked him to ‘terminate the paper straight away’ but he refused. He said: ‘Someone’s got to authorise it and do the checks. It’s either a stolen vehicle or someone’s been pulled. ‘It’s got to be someone who knows me, who knows my address. I’m a community advocate for the people in my community. ‘I get them off the streets, I get them into the gym and keep them positive. I sort a lot of problems out in Oldham and I’ve got a high profile for doing things like that. ‘For me receiving this, it’s hit rock bottom. The system’s failed me by letting this [be sent] out.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
