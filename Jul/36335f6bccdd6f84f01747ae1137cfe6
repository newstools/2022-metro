A gay couple needed hospital treatment after a ‘terrible attack’ on the eve of the 50th anniversary of London Pride. The two men – one of whom is performing in the London Gay Men’s Chorus today – were targeted in the early hours of Saturday after leaving a bar in Mile End. A man in his 30s has been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm, but it is believed more than one person took part. The victims, one in his 30s and the other in his 40s, were taken to hospital and discharged after treatment, the Metropolitan Police said. The incident is being treated as a suspected homophobic hate crime ‘due to insults shouted’ by the attackers. The London Gay Men’s Chorus described the assault as a ‘terrible attack’, which it said reinforces the importance of fighting back against homophobia. The group is participating in Saturday’s Pride event in London, which is this year marking the 50th anniversary of the UK’s first Pride parade. Peter Ptashko, chorus chair said: ‘This terrible attack only serves to underline how important it remains to fight against homophobia and all forms of discrimination. ‘After 30 years, our mission of ‘social justice through song’ has never been more important to achieve a more equal, diverse and inclusive society that we all need today more than ever.’ Police have appealed to any witnesses who are yet to speak with officers to contact them.
