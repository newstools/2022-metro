Florals for spring may not be groundbreaking, but when summer comes around you can’t get cuter than a citrus print piece. Mediterranean imagery is everywhere on the high street right now, with oranges, lemons, and limes taking centre stage. Conjuring mental pictures of spritzes in the sun and freshly-squeezed juice over al fresco dinners, a citrus print is the perfect way to put a twist on summer dressing. Go for a kitsch, vintage-style lemon print to stand out, or choose a more demure design with just a hint of a fruity theme if you want something you can wear everyday. Keeping accessories neutral will help you avoid any Carmen Miranda comparisons, although contrasting bright shades can add even more fun to your outfit. That’s what this trend is all about; fun.
