Zhou Guanyu was involved in a severe, multi-car crash at the start of the British Grand Prix. At lights out, Mercedes driver George Russell was clipped by AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly, in turn hitting Zhou with his Alfa Romeo flipping upside down and sent skidding into the barriers at high-speed, with the car flying into catch fencing. The incident bought out the red flag at the Silverstone with several other cars including Esteban Ocon, Yuki Tsunoda, Sebastian Vettel and Alex Albon also receiving heavy damage. Russell seeing the incident stopped his car off the track and immediately ran over to the wreckage to help Zhou. The Chinese driver was stuck in his car for some time but thankfully emerged from his Alfa Romeo, and while he was carried off on a stretcher his team have said that he is fine. Nearly two hours later, the FIA announced that Zhou had left the medical centre, while Albon has gone to the local hospital as a precaution. The race was restarted nearly an hour later, even after protestors attempted to disrupt the event by sitting on the track during the red flag period. Despite all the chaos, only three cars failed to make the restart, namely Zhou, Albon and Russell, although the Brit insisted that he wanted to keep racing.
