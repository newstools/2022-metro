Alan Carr has revealed he collapsed on stage recently following shooting pains in his leg. The comedian, 46, has been on his Regional Trinket tour over the last few weeks, performing in venues up and down the UK and leaving audiences in stitches. Everything was going so well until Sunday night, when the Chatty Man was forced to complete his act on crutches after a pain that he later described as ‘the worst cramp ever.’ Alan was performing at Glasgow’s King’s Theatre when he began ‘rolling around on the floor,’ which some ticket holders assumed was part of the act, before they realised he was actually in pain. The comic took to his Instagram Story later that night to show he was icing his leg with frozen peas, writing: ‘If you came to the gig tonight, you’ll know’. He later posted a video explaining the incident: ‘I’ve been performing up in Glasgow and there’s a bit in my routine where I pretend to be Jason Statham and I high-kicked, and then I got the worst cramp ever,’ he began. ‘Oh my God! It was shooting pains and I was rolling around on the floor, and people thought it was part of the act.’ His ‘lovely tour manager’ then passed him a crutch through the curtain, allowing him to walk and finish the last five minutes of his performance. But, he was in pain, and took some Ibuprofen after coming off stage to ease it, telling his followers that he is ‘healed’ now, but thinks he has torn a muscle and hopes to get some rest to give himself time to recover. ‘I’m sorry, I put a very dramatic picture of me with some peas but I’m fine, I’ll be fine, I just felt eggy and I just felt silly rolling around on the floor. I’ve never known pain like it,’ he added. In true Alan style, he signed off the video with a jokey tone: ‘Anyway, I will soldier on, as I always do,’ he quipped before blowing a kiss to the camera. The presenter has since been inundated with well wishes from his 1.1million followers, as well as famous friends wishing him a speedy recovery. Fellow comedian John Bishop commented: ‘What a trooper – you are an example to us all 👏👏👏👏👏’. Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison wrote: ‘I love you man 😍‘, while Carol Voderman exclaimed: ‘Oh Al ❤️❤️’. Martine McCutcheon was also on hand to offer words of comfort: ‘Oh bless you. What a trooper! Rest up and take care of yourself tho please! 💖🙏🏽💖’, with Dame Kelly Holmes branding him ‘the best’. Alan’s on-stage mishap follows reports that he will be taking time off next year to ‘sort myself out’ after his divorce from husband Paul Drayton. Speaking to Laura Boyd for STV’s What’s On Scotland programme while touring in Scotland, he said: ‘I’ve got to sort out that work/life balance. Next year, you’ll probably see a bit less of Alan. I’m going to sort myself out. I think I’m ready for it and, who knows, I might find love.’ He’s been rather open about the breakdown of his marriage after announcing his split from Paul in January, also describing his tour as like ‘therapy’ for him following his divorce, after the pair were together for over a decade. Outlining how the writing process for the show came ‘from the heart’, he told ITV’s Lorraine: ‘It’s quite emotional, uplifting and it was actually my therapy really.’ Got a story?
