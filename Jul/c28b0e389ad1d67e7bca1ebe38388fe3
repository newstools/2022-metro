Cristiano Ronaldo was spotted at Portugal’s training ground on Monday after missing the start of Manchester United’s pre-season campaign. The 37-year-old has told United that he wants to leave Old Trafford this summer in order to join a club who will be playing in the Champions League. Ronaldo was expected to report for pre-season with United on Monday but the club granted the forward’s absence request due to ‘family reasons’. On Monday afternoon, Portuguese TV station SIC Noticias filmed Ronaldo arriving at Portugal’s training base located on the outskirts of Lisbon. It remains unclear if Ronaldo will return to Manchester before the squad travel to Bangkok on Friday to begin their pre-season tour. Ronaldo has spent part of the summer on holiday in Majorca before travelling back to Portugal. Meanwhile, Ronaldo’s agent Jorge Mendes has already held talks with Chelsea about a potential deal this summer. It’s understood that Chelsea are open to the idea of Ronaldo moving to Stamford Bridge but the 37-year-old would need to reduce his £480,000-a-week salary. Bayern Munich were also approached but the Bundesliga champions are not interested in a deal. Similarly, Real Madrid have ruled out the prospect of signing Ronaldo for a second time in his career. Chelsea have also been offered the chance to sign Neymar, with Paris Saint-Germain keen to offload the Brazilian before the end of the window. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
