Sadio Mane says he asked to leave Liverpool a year ago, having to wait an entire season to secure his move to Bayern Munich. The 30-year-old spent six brilliant seasons with the Reds, but reveals that after his fifth campaign at Anfield he was ready to move on. It was nearly the dream final season with Jurgen Klopp’s side, winning the FA Cup and Carabao Cup but very narrowly missing out on the Champions League and Premier League. If it had been entirely down to Mane then he wouldn’t have been involved in any of those challenges, telling Klopp that he wanted a move last summer. ‘It was last year I took my decision to leave because I need a new challenge in my life,’ Mane told BBC Sport Africa. ‘For me, it was the right time. I spoke with the coach [Jurgen Klopp] one year ago and talked to him about my desire to leave. ‘If you see my story, I came from a small town – my life was always a challenge, so I want to challenge myself all the time.’ Mane got his wish and left Liverpool this summer, joining Bayern Munich for an initial fee of around £27m, which could rise to £35m. The Senegalese star is already sure he made the right choice, despite loving his time with the Reds. ‘I spent eight years in the Premier League, and of course I spent six wonderful years with Liverpool and I can say we won almost everything possible,’ he said. ‘It was not an easy decision but in life, you have to sometimes take decisions and so far I think it’s the best decision I have taken in my career. ‘I’m today at one of the best clubs in the world and I’m really, really happy to be at Bayern Munich and very excited to start this season.’ MORE : Former Liverpool chairman David Moores who led Reds to Istanbul Champions League win dies MORE : Liverpool midfielder set to follow Harvey Elliott path with new loan transfer For more stories like this, check our sport page.
