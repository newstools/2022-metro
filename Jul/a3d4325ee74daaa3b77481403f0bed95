It’s happening. The most explosive episode of Love Island is upon us – the Casa Amor recoupling. Laura Whitmore has made her pilgrimage to the villa and the islanders will be forced to decide if they want to stick in their current coupling or switch with a new bombshell after having their heads turned. Naturally, after a week of snogging on the sly the islanders have been thrown by the looming recoupling. ‘My head’s fried, scrambled, whatever way you like your eggs,’ cried Dami Hope. ‘That’s the way my head is right now. I’m scared.’ As he should be, after kissing Summer Bowte despite being coupled up with the queen that is Indiyah Polack. Over in Casa Amor, Paige Thorne beamed that she’s ‘excited’ to see Jacques O’Neill unaware that while she’s gearing up for their reunion, he’s actually kissing Cheyanne Kerr. Then there’s Andrew Le Page, who is pretty much coupled up with Coco Lodge after being warned by the Casa Amor bombshells Tasha Ghouri is ‘walking all over’ him. She’s also pretty smitten with Billy Brown, so it appears what was thought of as one of the strongest couples by those in the villa are doomed for an explosive split. We. Are. Living. For. It. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
