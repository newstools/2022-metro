Summer Botwe and Billy Brown are the latest Love Island contestants to be sent packing. In Thursday night’s episode, four islanders were put at risk of being dumped after a public vote. Danica Taylor, Dami Hope, Billy and Summer were voted the least popular out of the remaining contestants. It was up to the boys and girls to choose one of each of the duos to go home. Tonight, it was confirmed Billy and Summer would be leaving after some tough decisions were made. After their exit, Summer said: ‘I’m still looking for love, that’s why we came here in the first place. ‘I’m going to be looking on the outside,’ with Billy cheekily quipping: ‘He’d be a lucky man.’ It comes after many fans complained that the cliffhanger was ‘boring’ after predicting Billy and Summer would be sent home. Sharing their suspicions on social media, one wrote: ‘What’s the point in this cliffhanger, we all know that Summer and Billy will be voted out anyway.’ Echoing a similar sentiment, another said: ‘The Islanders are obviously going to save Dami. Come on now, what was the point in that?’ ‘Summer and Billy are leaving we already know that just cut the chase,’ penned a third. Tonight saw four new bombshells come into the villa, shortly after Summer and Billy left. But will any of them manage to shake things up, and build a connection with any of the existing islanders? Love Island continues tomorrow night at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
