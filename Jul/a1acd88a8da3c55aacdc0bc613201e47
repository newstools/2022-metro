A truck carrying 40,000 pounds of crisps caught fire outside the manufacturing site in Florida. Firefighters were called to Outlaw Snax in Ocala to tackle the blaze. Footage captures the moment firefighters tackled the inferno as the colourful array of crisp bags come flooding out the back. The fire crews used a ‘deck gun’ – a high capacity jet stream used to knock down fires with a clear line of sight’ to tackle the blaze. No injuries were reported as a result of the fire. The cause is yet to be determined. It is not the first time a crisps related fire has been reported about. In November 2021, the Walkers factory in Leicester had to be evacuated because a large fire broke out inside. Firefighters were sent from across the city to tackle the blaze as the huge facility filled up with smoke. The alarm was raised shortly before 10.45am on the morning. A special unit was sent to cut away parts of the factory’s damaged roof in an attempt to pinpoint the source of the fire. Rescuers confirmed no casualties were reported.
