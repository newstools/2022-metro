Rafael Nadal admits that ‘something is not going well’ as he struggles with an abdominal injury and it will be a battle to be 100 per cent for his Wimbledon semi-final against Nick Kyrgios. The Spanish legend came through an epic battle with Taylor Fritz in the quarter-finals in London, eventually coming through 3-6 7-5 3-6 7-5 7-6 (10-4). This was despite going off the court for medical treatment during the second set for medical treatment, returning to show incredible grit and quality to down the impressive American. Asked after the match how he was holding up, Nadal told the BBC: ‘The body in general is fine, of course in the abdominal something is not going well, to be honest. ‘I had to find a way to serve a little bit different and for a lot of moments I was thinking I would not be able to finish the match, but the court, the energy is something else so thanks for that.’ Nadal now has a day to recover, with his semi-final against the Australian on Friday and he knows he will have to be at his best to beat his in-form rival, but admits he might not be fully fit. On his clash with Kyrgios, he said: ‘First thing, I hope to be ready to play. ‘Nick is a great player on all surfaces, but especially here on grass, he’s having a great grass court season. ‘It’s going to be a big challenge, I need to be at 100% to keep having chances, so that’s what I’m going to try to do.’ MORE : Rafael Nadal books Wimbledon semi-final spot to keep Surface Slam dream alive MORE : ‘I didn’t go about things great earlier in my career!’ – Nick Kyrgios reacts to reaching first Wimbledon semi-final For more stories like this, check our sport page.
