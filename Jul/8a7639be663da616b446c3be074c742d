A British woman has fallen to her death while hiking in the Italian Dolomites. The 56-year-old was trekking with her husband when she slipped and plunged 100ft on to the rocks below. Local reports suggest the tourist, who was not named, was at the popular hiking destination of Catinaccio when she suddenly fell on Sunday afternoon. The tragedy comes just a week after a 54-year-old hiker fell to his death nearby. Earlier this month, an avalanche killed nearly a dozen people when a huge chunk of ice detached from the Marmolada, the largest glacier in the Dolomites. It sent a torrent of ice, rock and debris hurtling towards hikers below. Distraught family members are now questioning whether the glacier, which has been melting at an accelerated rate over the past decade, should have been closed off. Italian prosecutors have launched an investigation, but initial findings reportedly suggest the avalanche could not have been predicted. This latest death in the Dolomites is the second confirmed tragedy involving Britons in Italy in the last week. Businessman Aran Chada, a 51-year-old sales director from Leicestershire, leapt from a rented boat into Lake Garda to save his son from drowning. He helped the boy back to safety but then disappeared under the water after having a suspected seizure. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
