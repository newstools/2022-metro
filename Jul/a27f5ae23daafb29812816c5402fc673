The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William accompanied Prince George as he made his Wimbledon debut today. The royal family attended the Wimbledon Men’s Final between Novak Djokovic and Nick Kyrgios. The duchess stepped out in a navy and white polka dot midi dress, with pearl buttons. The piece – which has peplum waist details as well as puffed sleeves – is from Alessandra Rich and costs £1,335 (but is currently on sale for £934). The dress was a more formal choice for the occasion – but the style is a favourite with Kate and she teamed it with white slingback heels and silver accessories. George looked dressed to the nines for the occasion, wearing a smart dark blue suit to match his mother’s outfit for the final. While Prince William wore formal trousers with a shirt and a different coloured blazer. Kate went for another polka dot number earlier this week when she attended the championships, opting for a blue and white polka dot dress. Her other outfits this week have included a classic white dress for the polo, as well as a vibrant yellow number for the Women’s Final yesterday.
