Families who can afford to buy a big tub of Lurpak will now have to drop close to a tenner for the pricey butter. You might have heard but the UK is currently struggling with the worst rate of inflation since the 1970s, egged on by the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine. It means the price of ordinary food items are, like so many household bills, skyrocketing and Lurpak is no exception. The spreadable blend now costs £7.25 for a 750g tub at Sainsbury’s. A 500g tub is £5 and the smaller 250g tub is £2.75. However, you are advised to shop around as the same 750g tub is £5.30 at Tesco. Chicken has also seen a huge hike price. A pack of 1kg chicken breasts from Sainsbury’s now costs £6.02 – up £1.18 from £4.84. Similarly a Warburtons toastie white loaf costs 15p more now than it did a year ago, according to retail research company Assosia. If you popped to the shop to buy butter, bread, chicken and a bag of pasta you would pay £11.78 on average – almost £2 more than the same basket in 2021. In general, the average price of sunflower oil has gone up by 27%, spring onions by 33%, pasta by 14% and milk up by between 11-18% depending on the size, according to The Food Foundation. It comes as Tesco has stopped stocking Heinz products because they have become too expensive. This is all part of the supermarket’s attempts to keep costs low for consumers while also making a profit. Kraft Heinz, which makes Tomato Ketchup and Baked Beans, said its production costs were rising, leading to a rise in the cost of the products.
