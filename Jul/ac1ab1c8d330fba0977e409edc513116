Kelly Brook and Jeremy Parisi have tied the knot at a stunning wedding in Italy. The couple, who first met in 2014, looked over the moon as they enjoyed their special day at the beautiful Villa Nota Pisani. Kelly, 42, shared clips on her Instagram Stories, showing the venue covered in candles and roses. She wore a simple and beautiful white gown and veil, and danced the night away with her new husband, who looked dapper in a suit. Captioning one video ‘Just Married,’ Kelly showed her loved ones singing along to That’s Amore, and singer Maurizio Marchini serenading them beautifully at the reception. In another clip, Kelly and Jeremy could be seen dancing to Mary Wells’ My Guy with fireworks in the background. Jeremy also shared snaps of the big day, simply writing: ‘Just Married❤️👰🏻‍♀️🤵‍♂️’. A source previously told The Sun of the couple’s big day: ‘Kelly has thrown the kitchen sink at her wedding and it’s turning into quite an extravagant affair. ‘She has booked the Villa Nota Pisani in central Italy for the ceremony and reception. ‘It is a beautiful location and they fell in love with it as soon as they saw it.’ The couple are also thought to have had a funfair at the reception, and invited guests including Kylie Minogue. The pair met in 2014 after Kelly, 42, saw Jeremy, 37, in an Instagram video and slid into his DMs. The actress and model has kept her relationship mostly out of the spotlight, but she did share a glimpse into their romance after celebrating their seventh anniversary in April. Speaking on her Heart FM Drivetime Show, Kelly revealed: ‘He put together a really lovely photo album of all his favourite pictures and moments. He’s done it every year for the past seven years. ‘He’s definitely the most romantic of the two of us. He’s Italian and French, so what can I say?’ Kelly has been engaged three times in the past, to actors Jason Statham and Billy Zane, and Gladiators star David McIntosh. She has also been in relationships with rugby players Danny Cipriani and Thom Evans. Got a story?
