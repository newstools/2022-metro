Gen Z have been playing an old game – the ‘Rice Purity Test’ – to see how ‘innocent’ they are. It’s a bit of fun, with users sharing their scores, and the higher ones showing you’re more ‘pure’ than those with lower numbers. Of course, it’s worth pointing out that no one should take these tests seriously and purity is an arbitrary (and potentially even a repressive) concept – and, typically, the more life experience you have, the lower your score will become. So what exactly is the Rice Purity Test? The test is a series of 100 questions, ranging from ‘have you ever been on a date?’ to whether you’ve tried hardcore drugs. You tick the ones that apply then get your score. The game was developed in the 1980s by Rice University (hence the name) and so some questions feel out of date – but this hasn’t stopped TikTokkers from giving it a go. Some have felt the need to update the game though, with a new version called the ‘Innocence Test’ – this one has modern references such as Tinder, bringing it up to 2022. It was created by two best friends, both women, who wanted to make the concept modern. It’s become a source of entertainment for teens who might be at a stage in their lives when the score can change quickly as they try new things. One person commented on a viral video: ‘Mine dropped 20 points in a week’. Both tests warn the items listed shouldn’t be seen as a ‘bucket list’ – as you should never feel pressured to tick experiences off if you don’t want to do. However, for a bit of fun with friends, why not give it a go? A quick Google is all you need to find both tests – and sharing your score isn’t mandatory. Do you have a story to share?
