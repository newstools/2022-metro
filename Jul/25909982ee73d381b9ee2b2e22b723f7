It was only five minutes ago that bombshell Nathalia Campos dubbed Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu ‘Ekin-Who?’, but the Love Island star has become the first contestant to hit a social media milestone. Ekin-Su has well and truly been taken to the hearts of the nation over recent weeks, with plenty of viewers branding her and other half Davide Sanclimenti winners of the series already. The Turkish actress has had her fair share of iconic moments in the villa, from bust ups with fellow Islanders, to one-liners we’ll be quoting for the next year at least. However, since the Islanders are totally cut off from the outside world and unable to communicate with friends, family, or followers, they have no idea how they’re being perceived by viewers – or what their social media follower count is. Ekin will surely be thrilled to bits when she is finally back on home turf, as she’s become the first of the 2022 cast to hit one million followers on Instagram. The loved ones running her social media while she’s in the villa thanked her legion of fans for their support with a celebratory post, sharing that Ekin will be ‘blown away’ when she finds out. ‘So excited to say that we are now a family of 1 Million!!! It would never have been possible without all your immense support and encouragement for Ekin-Su,’ they wrote. ‘She will be blow away to know that she has has so many people behind her. A big thank you to every single one of you, means so much.’ They added a jolly video of Ekin living her best life and boogying to the Macarena on the show as ‘a little celebration dance.’ It’ll come as no surprise that Ekin has earned herself actual fan pages on social media, with her army of followers congratulating the reality star on hitting the one milli mark. ‘She’s stolen the nations heart 😍’, one fan wrote, with another commenting: ‘You deserve this ekin we love you ❤️’. ‘Shes the main character of this show and we stan for it ❤️❤️💗💗’, a third penned. Others added that she has ‘carried’ the series, while sharing their excitement over the possibility of ‘Ekinde’ being crowned winners. Ekin-Su may be the most followed Islander, but 19-year-old Gemma Owen isn’t far behind her, with her follower count also in the 900,000s. It would be fair to say that Ekin has endured her fair share of drama this series, but she seems to have found ‘the one’ in her Itallian stallion. Despite newbie bombshell Nathalia setting her sights firmly on Davide entering the villa in the penultimate week, the pair – who viewers continue to liken to an old married couple with their larking around one minute, bickering the next – are staying strong. Ekin-Su chose to remain coupled up with Davide in the latest dramatic recoupling, while Nathalia ended up with fellow newcomer Reece. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
