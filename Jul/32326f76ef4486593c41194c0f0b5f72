A Subway worker is to be handed nearly £13,000 after she was bullied by her boss. Kady Reilly, who is vegan, was subjected to taunts by Himanshu Lahar who waved meat in her face, encouraged her to handle it and ridiculed her allergies. He taunted her about her lifestyle choice and made disparaging comments about her appearance, an employment tribunal heard. He waved meat under her nose and said ‘go on, eat it, what could happen?’ adding ‘eat like a man, walk like a bull’. Kady highlighted bad practices at the Subway at a petrol station in Bridgeton, Glasgow, including: She was sacked after contacting Environmental Health to raise some of her concerns. She took the owners of the franchise, RT Management Bridgeton Limited, to a tribunal which found in her favour, adding that her boss’s comments went against the Equality Act because veganism is classed as a philosophical belief. The hearing was told: ‘She described being “shocked” at what she described as Mr Lahar’s flippant attitude towards allergies and the possible consequences of a person consuming a substance which they had a severe allergic reaction to. ‘She said that she had “never been disrespected in a work environment before”. When she complained about the lack of a sanitary bin Lahar told her she was the only woman ‘of menstruating age’ and she should use the bin in the kitchen. Kady chose to use the bin in the petrol station instead. Employment Judge Claire McManus said: ‘We were satisfied on the basis of [her] evidence that her belief in veganism perpetrates her life and how she lives her life. ‘[She] showed that her practice of veganism is a belief intrinsic to her sense of identity. ‘We were satisfied that for [Miss Reilly], veganism is a philosophical belief within the meaning of section 10 of the Equality Act 2010 and is a protected characteristic for her.’   Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
