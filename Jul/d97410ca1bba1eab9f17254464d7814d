Love Island star Luca Bish finally boiled over tonight after being made to watch clips of his partner Gemma Owen ‘flirting’ with Billy Brown. The islanders squirmed around in their seats during Mad Movies night, which saw them watch clips of each other getting up to no good in Casa Amor. However, Luca, 23, was particularly seething after watching Gemma, 19, get close to bombshell Billy, who has made more than one attempt to form a connection with Michael Owen’s daughter despite her being coupled up with the fishmonger and the two even dropping the L-bomb recently. Nobody could convince Luca that Gemma wasn’t flirting with Billy in the clips, and he fumed to the boys: ‘I don’t even want to talk to her tonight. Made me look like an absolute f*****g w****r  I ain’t going f*****g near that bird.’ He then warned: ‘Bring a f*****g bird in now and watch me flirt. If she wants to play it down to me I will f*****g explode.’ Billy did little to calm him down after telling his love rival: ‘It was a bit flirty.’ Adam Collard insisted Gemma was being ‘genuine’ with him and said: ‘Billy fancies her and he’ll 100% admit that, I don’t think it’s his fault though. ‘Don’t be rash.’ Gemma then emerged from the toilet but didn’t speak to Luca, prompting him to say: ‘She’s got a f*****g smile on her face, embarrassing.’ The two later hashed it out alone as Gemma, who also became heated, insisted he was blowing it all out of proportion and that she wasn’t ‘entertaining’ Billy. Viewers were taken aback by Luca’s strong reaction, with one tweeting: ‘Nah Luca is going too far.’ One agreed: ‘Luca wants them to bring in a whole human being so he can use them to make Gemma jealous? That dude is scary, he was saying I love you the other day.’ Another said: ‘If Luca is not in the bottom three the next public vote I’m rioting.’ Earlier in the episode, the girls were seen calling Luca out for egging on the boys to crack on with the new bombshells during Casa Amor, while himself remaining loyal to Gemma. Love Island airs nightly at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
