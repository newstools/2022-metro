Love Island’s Danica Taylor and Jamie Allen are the latest contestants to be dumped from the ITV2 dating show. During Tuesday’s episode, the islanders were shocked as they quickly learned that the public have been voting for their favourite pairings and that the duo with the fewest votes would be eliminated. Danica and Jamie were revealed to be vulnerable alongside Dami and Indiyah and Adam Collard and Paige Thorne. ‘I’m walking out of here with somebody who I genuinely think I’ve got quite a good connection with,’ Danica said before leaving the villa. ‘I’m so proud of myself.’ Speaking about her blossoming romance with Jamie, she enthused: ‘It’s still early days for me and Jamie but we just clicked. ‘I remember the first night he came in and we were just talking. I didn’t know anything about him, I didn’t know where he lived, his family, or his career but we’d spoken all night. ‘I felt his energy and that he really liked me and wanted to get to know me for me – that is a feeling that I hadn’t felt with any of the other guys.’ Danica continued: ‘When you know, you know and my gut was telling me that this guy likes me and wanted to get to know me. ‘We get along, it’s just easy and natural and doesn’t feel forced. We both bring out the best in each other.’ Just five couples remain now: Dami and Iniyah, Adam and Paige, Luca Bish and Gemma Owen, Andrew Le Page and Tasha Gouri, Davide Sanclimenti and Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu. Love Island continues on Thursday at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
