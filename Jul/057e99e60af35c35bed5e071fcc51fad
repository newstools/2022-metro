Nick Kyrgios has sealed his spot in the Wimbledon semi-finals with an impressive 6-4 6-3 7-6 win over Chilean Cristian Garin. It is now a best-ever Grand Slam singles run for the fiery Australian and he will next face world No.4 Rafael Nadal or 11th-seed Taylor Fritz for a place in the final. Kyrgios’ run at the 2022 Championships has been laced with controversy, with the 27-year-old facing an assault charge of his ex-girlfriend Chiara Passari for an alleged incident which took place in December last year. Speaking after his win over Garin, Kyrgios said: ‘I never thought I’d be in the semi-final of a Grand Slam, I thought that ship had sailed. ‘I didn’t go about things great earlier in my career and thought I missed that window. I’m really proud about the way I’ve come back out here with my team and put on a performance. ‘Each person in my team plays an important role. To be in the semi-final of a Grand Slam, I’m pretty happy! I felt I was playing on the back foot a lot, he (Garin) is a hell of a player and I got lucky on a couple break points. ‘I will take that and prepare for my next match. I don’t want to think about the semi-final just yet! There’s a lot to be done. My dad will cook me dinner and we’ll watch a movie and chill out.’ Kyrgios has also been involved in various high-profile arguments with journalists, umpires, line judges, fans and fellow players during the current tournament. The world No.40 adds his victory over Garin to wins over Brandon Nakashima, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Filip Krajinovic and Great Britain’s Paul Jubb.
