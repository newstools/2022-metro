Harmony Tan admits she is struggling to comprehend her achievements after she extended her Wimbledon run, crushing Britain’s Katie Boulter to book her place the fourth round. Boulter shot to national prominence earlier this week when she defeated former finalist Karolina Pliskova in emotional circumstances, just two days after the death of her grandmother. Tan, however, buoyed by her landmark victory over Serena Williams in the first round, sailed through following what was an ultimately straightforward 6-1, 6-1 victory. ‘No I don’t believe it yet – if I sleep a little bit, tomorrow maybe I will believe it, but it’s amazing,’ she said afterwards. ‘I think I like grass, I never play on this court but I like to play with slice and volley and everything with my game so I’m really happy. ‘It was really emotional for the first round against Serena [Williams] and after it was just playing match by match and today was really good tennis. I don’t know why but it depends on the day!’ British No.3 Boulter had hoped to take inspiration from Leicester City’s 2015-16 miraculous Premier League title victory and Emma Raducanu’s 2021 US Open win to spur her to further SW19 glory. Tan, the 24-year-old world number 115, made just five unforced errors as she cantered into the last 16 and extend her maiden Wimbledon run. Boulter conceded a difficult match with a double fault, which handed Tan her third break of the set. The home favourite, unable to get anywhere near the heights of her second-round display, made 21 unforced errors. MORE : Who is Katie Boulter’s boyfriend Alex de Minaur?
