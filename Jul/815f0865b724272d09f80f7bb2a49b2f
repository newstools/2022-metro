Prince George is seen beaming on a British beach in a new photograph released for his birthday on Friday. People across the UK will collectively be thinking ‘how time flies’ as the future king turns nine. The new image shows him wearing a blue polo-style top with a sandy shoreline and water behind him. It was taken by his mum Kate Middleton, who regularly snaps pictures of her three children to mark their milestones. Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in London on July 22 2013, weighing 8lb 6oz. The third in line to the throne made his public debut on the hospital steps one day later, wrapped in a white merino wool shawl and cradled in his mother’s arms. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are rumoured to be planning a move to Berkshire to be close to George’s new school and the Queen. His big day comes after he made his first ever appearance at Wimbledon earlier this month – in the royal box, not playing. It was quite an eventful final to watch for the prince – who looked less than impressed when Australian player Nick Kyrgios swore and shouted at the umpire. The young royal looked smart in his blue suit, but also had scorching 28°C sunshine to deal with. Winner Novak Djokovic later handed the Wimbledon trophy to George, who said ‘it’s a bit heavy’. The royal children also played a big part in the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee last month. The eldest Cambridge child caught attention by belting out Sweet Caroline, while Princess Charlotte took charge by scolding her little brother. But it was Prince Louis who stole the show by howling and covering his ears during a flypast as well as sharing a sweet moment with his grandpa, Prince Charles.
