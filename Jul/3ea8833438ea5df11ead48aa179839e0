Love Island’s couples are set to face they biggest test of the series so far as Casa Amor returns for 2022. Fans have been given a first look inside Casa Amor, where one half of the existing contestants – believed to be the girls – will be staying with a new cohort of bombshells. This year’s Casa Amor looks more luxe than ever, with a large pool for the singletons to splash around in, and day beds and loungers for them to top up their tans. There’s a mini firepit for those all-important chats, as well as a spacious dining room for the newbies to enjoy their meals. The new pairings will also be getting to know the original Islanders better by cosying up in double beds together, with the bedroom decorated in orange and blue with artworks of giant mouths with slices of pizza and lollypops being consumed. It was confirmed at the end of Thursday night’s show that Casa Amor would return on Friday, which is bound to cause some tension with the couples. It’s believed that it will be the female Islanders heading to Casa Amor, leaving the lads to welcome the new girls into the existing villa. Friday’s episode suggest it could be the girls leaving as they head out for cocktails following a surprise text message in the first look. Casa Amor usually lasts for around three to four days, just long enough for heads to be turned and for the infamous postcard to be sent to the main villa to stir up tensions. Love Island airs weeknights from 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
