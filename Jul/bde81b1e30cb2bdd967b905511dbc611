Aldi has been crowned as the cheapest supermarket chain for June, undercutting some of its competitors by more than £25. With the cost of the living crisis only worsening in the UK, households are set to see their yearly food bills balloon by nearly £400. So, knowing where to shop can become a make or break for many low-income families. According to the latest monthly analysis by consumer group Which?, Aldi was the most affordable and on average, shoppers would pay £75.61 for a basket of 52 popular groceries. It comes just £1.38 cheaper than rival Lidl – but every penny counts nowadays when it comes to a bargain. It is the first time in seven months that Aldi has been the cheapest – with Lidl previously claiming the sought-after title six months in a row. Which? studied the prices of items including seedless grapes, white bread and tea bags, every day in June. Analysts looked into branded products like Heinz Baked Beans and Dolmio sauce, as well as own-brand foods like apples and lettuce. Of the ‘big four’ supermarkets, Asda was the cheapest, costing £85.22. Tesco was hot on Asda’s heels at £86.63, followed by Sainsbury’s at £87.24 and Morrisons at £91.03. Ocado was nearly the most expensive, with a basket costing £97.50. But the priciest trolley was from Waitrose, racking up at £101.14. The data from Which? comes as more and more shoppers are noticing prices rising the fastest in categories including dog food, butter and milk. Previous reports have also pointed out how basics like meat and pasta are getting more expensive. Experts attribute this to a number of factors including the knock-on effect of Covid, staff shortages due to Brexit and the war in Ukraine. This is having devastating consequences on the public, with desperate families forced to steal items such as baby formula. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
