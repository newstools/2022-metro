A woman has finally won her two-year battle to get her local council to cut an overgrown hedge – by posing naked. Jill White, from Tatworth, has been campaigning for Somerset County Council to fix the foliage next to the busy A358 near her home. She claimed as a result of the overgrowth her daughter struggled to use the pavement in her wheelchair. Jill eventually got sick of requesting the bush be trimmed over and over again, so took drastic action to make a point. She stood on the A358 with placards last Thursday which read: ‘I’ve trimmed my bush, now Highways trim yours.’ She told reporters: ‘After repeatedly requesting that the footpath from Tatworth to Chard be passable for pedestrians, wheelchair users and pushchairs, and after the council’s inaction I decided to have my own personal, light-hearted protest. ‘I’ve been requesting it for nearly two years. We have a fuel crisis and a poor bus service, so people are having to walk. ‘We’re coming into the school holidays and an accident will happen.’ The A358, also known as Tatworth Road, is in the Chard Eastern Development Area where lots of new housing is planned for years to come. Around 200 new homes are being built on the Snowdon Grange site nearby, but despite this Jill says there have been ‘limited efforts’ to widen or improve existing footpaths. She claims this leaves pedestrians, wheelchair users and other road users vulnerable to cars. But her naked protest appears to have been a success – as two county councillors have since confirmed work to cut the hedge and clear the footpaths will start next week. Councillor Jason Baker said: ‘There has been a work order raised and I am now chasing a date for the work to be completed. ‘We need to ensure that the path is cleared as well as the undergrowth being cut.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
