Even the most disciplined eaters know what it feels like to cave to a late-night pang of hunger. But few would be driven further than a quick raid on the pantry or, at worst, ordering a takeaway. An unsuspecting homeowner found the exception to the rule on his doorstep in Swansea this week, and was so baffled he felt obliged to share footage of the bizarre encounter on social media. Craig Allen answered a ring on his doorbell at 12.21am on Wednesday morning to the sight of a wide-eyed man in a beanie hat, armed only with a box of Crunchy Nut cornflakes. As he opened the door, the man politely introduces himself before asking: ‘I can’t pinch some milk off you by any chance?’ Mr Allen can be heard snapping back: ‘F***off mate.’ The stranger, unbothered by the rejection, apologises before calmly striding away into the night. The footage, filmed by Mr Allen’s smart doorbell, quickly went viral. But no one has been able to identify the ethereal stranger or get to the bottom of how he ended up in his conundrum. Mr Allen told WalesOnline: ‘I don’t know what he would have done if I had given him some milk, just scooped it out of the box? I don’t know!’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
