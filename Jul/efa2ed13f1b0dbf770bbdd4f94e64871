Conor McGregor has laughed off Jake Paul’s suggestions that the two must fight in the future, dismissing the American as a ‘nobody’. Paul has a 5-0 record in professional boxing having knocked out two former MMA world champions in that time – former Bellator and ONE champion Ben Askren and former UFC welterweight king Tyron Woodley. His immediate focus Hasim Rahman Jnr, the son of the former heavyweight champion who will fight Paul on 6 August after a bout with Tommy Fury fell through again. The YouTuber-turned-boxer has long campaigned for a boxing match with McGregor, a two-weight UFC champion who lost to Floyd Mayweather Jnr in his only professional boxing bout in 2017. When asked on The MMA Hour whether he believes that fight is edging nearer to becoming reality, Paul replied: ‘Yeah, for sure. ‘For me, fighting a couple more times, continuing to knock some people out [is what I need to do]. ‘And he has to get active again. Who knows when that’s gonna happen? ‘I think those two things needs to happen, and then at some point [a fight] has got to happen. You know, why not? ‘He’s a businessman, I’m a businessman, and that’s $75-100million for both of us.’ McGregor however shut down fight talk, tweeting: ‘You’ve 2 fights and done 70k buys alongside a laughing emoji. ‘You are a flop, kid. A nobody.’ McGregor has not fought since suffering a broken leg in his defeat to Dustin Poirier last July.
