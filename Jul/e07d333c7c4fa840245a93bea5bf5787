Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash tied the knot this week in a fairytale ceremony, and more details have emerged about the gorgeous day. The happy couple, who first met in Stacey’s I’m A Celebrity days, got hitched at their home, which they’ve dubbed Pickle Cottage. It’s been reported that the pair enjoyed a romantic first dance to Whitney Houston’s My Love Is Your Love after saying vows during an intimate Jewish ceremony. An source told MailOnline: ‘Stacey and Joe’s first dance together as husband and wife was to Whitney Houston’s My Love Is Your Love. ‘It was a picture-perfect moment – Stacey had tears in her eyes, it was so romantic. ‘She wore an off-white Cinderella style wedding gown, which her children loved seeing her in. The dress made her feel and look like a true princess.’ The pair enjoyed a private ceremony at their home, but revealed they will register their marriage legally afterwards. Stacey previously explained how she and Joe were able to marry at their private property, telling one fan during a Q&A: ‘As this is our private family home and we need it to remain that way, we couldn’t go for that option. ‘So we are having a relaxed private blessing in front of our closest friends & family and a ceremony of our love to each other and we will register our marriage legally after.’ During the reception, Towie star James Argent performed, and Stacey also shared a glimpse into the big day, posting a video of the tables and chairs lined up, with beautiful bouquets of white flowers. A wooden archway was also showered in flower arrangements and candles, with white chairs positioned on either side suggesting it was the aisle Stacey, 32, and Joe, 40, walked down before saying their vows beside a bench. A source told MailOnline of the beautiful day: ‘It was also important to Stacey for her day to uphold her strong Jewish values, as well as be a modern and fun day for everyone. ‘They had always wanted their wedding to be just for them, at their home, and keeping their celebrations intimate did not disappoint.’ While Stacey has kept her wedding dress a secret, she got emotional when she decided on the perfect gown a few weeks ago. Sharing a snap of herself teary-eyed, Stacey wrote: ‘Today I Choose My Wedding Dress 🕊 And I never want to forget this feeling…🤍 ‘I’ve been putting it off I think because the more I got excited about it the more silly I felt for some reason… I started feeling really conscious about not being, well I don’t know 😂🙈 I wouldn’t have done life any other way EVER. I’m so grateful for how it turned out and I genuinely believe everything happens for a reason. ‘But I suppose sometimes those old fashioned narratives make you feel that way don’t they? 🙈 I decided to try my dresses on, at home with just me not making a “thing” of it. But it turns out it felt like the hugest “thing” ever 😭 ‘My sister dropped the kids back from school and popped up and we both ended up emotional messes 😂 I loved every single second of today, trying them on, imagining seeing Joe for the first time, feeling the veil on my shoulders & seeing the glitter sparkle as I moved around. 🥺 none of these are THE dress but I took this picture to remember how excited I felt today. ‘And no matter who, how or what way around you do it, it’s the most special moment ever 🤍🕊.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted reps for Stacey Solomon and Joe Swash for comment.
