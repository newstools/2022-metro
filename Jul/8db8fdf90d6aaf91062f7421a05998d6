Thailand is on the cusp of introducing chemical castration to tackle repeat sex offenders. Those deemed at risk of re-offending may soon be offered injections that reduce their testosterone levels, in return for shorter jail sentences. The bill was approved on Monday by 145 senators and two abstentions after the lower house passed it in March. It still requires another house vote, then royal endorsement. But experts on sexual violence have warned the move will not help as it ‘will not change sex offenders’ mindsets’. Of 16,413 convicted sex offenders released from Thai prisons between 2013 and 2020, 4,848 have re-offended, corrections department figures show. Those offered chemical castration would be monitored for 10 years and be required to wear electronic monitoring bracelets. But two doctors would have to approve giving them the option. A small number of other countries already use the technique, including Poland, South Korea, Russia and Estonia, as well as some U.S. states. Thailand’s Justice Minister Somsak Thepsuthin said on Tuesday: ‘I want this law to pass quickly. I don’t want to see news about bad things happening to women again.’ But Jaded Chouwilai, director of the Women and Men Progressive Movement Foundation, has cautioned: ‘To use punishment like execution or injected castration reinforces the idea that offender can no longer be rehabilitated.’ Last year, Pakistan U-turned on an announcement that serial rapists would be punished with chemical castration. The decision was made after the Islamic Ideology Council found chemical castration un-Islamic. Amnesty International had slammed the move as ‘cruel and inhuman’, adding that authorities ‘should address the deep-seated problems in the criminal justice system that invariably deny justice to victims’.
