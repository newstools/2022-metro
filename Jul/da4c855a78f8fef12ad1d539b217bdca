A Ryanair steward has been told he faces jail after a court heard he drank wine and whiskey on the job. Sam Thompson, 26, was arrested on the tarmac after a witness saw him sip Jack Daniels from the trolley before ‘necking’ a mini wine bottle on their flight into Stansted on May 18. He was found to be five times over the legal limit for cabin crew members on duty, which is equivalent to around 40% over the drink-driving limit. Thompson admitted to performing an aviation function while his ability to do so was impaired by drink. The offence carries a punishment of up to two years’ jail or a hefty fine. Thompson’s defence lawyer told Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court his client and alcohol are ‘not the best of friends’. Nishma Khan, prosecuting, said the witness started filming the 26-year-old after seeing him drinking the Jack Daniels. The witness then saw him sit down and ‘take a small bottle of wine out of his pocket’ before ‘necking the whole bottle’, according to Ms Khan. She added: ‘He was still on duty while the flight was in the air’. Presiding magistrate, Kristien Chafer, ordered a report to be prepared on the defendant to decide how he should be sentenced. Thompson, of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, was granted bail until his sentencing hearing at a later date. Following his arrest, he was sacked from his job at Lauda Europe, a subsidiary of Ryanair which was operating the flight. A spokesperson for Ryanair said company policy forbids any cabin or flight crew to consume alcohol from 8 hours before flight duty, in line with European Aviation Safety Agency regulations.
