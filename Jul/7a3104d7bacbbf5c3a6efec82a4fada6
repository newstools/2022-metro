We’ve all experienced the pain of sitting down with a fresh box of chips at the seaside, only to lock eyes with a greedy seagull. Lucky folk will successfully ‘shoo’ the bird onto other unsuspecting beach-dwellers – but the unlucky ones will face a battle to the death for their chips. Typically, it ends with a seagull – or even a flock of them – swooping in and pinching your tasty treats. And it seems, no matter how much shouting or hand-waving, nothing can deter those pesky gulls. Until now, that is. A new song could be just the thing you need for your next beach trip. Deliveroo has teamed up with herring and seagull expert, Dr Madeleine Gomas, to create a birdie banger named ‘Bye Gull Bye.’ It turns out, it’s a tried and tested track for keeping the seagulls away. The tune features melodic and climatic calls from birds – such as falcons and eagles – as a way to keep the scavengers at bay. Not to mention, it’s actually pretty catchy. Dr Madeleine explains: ‘My published research has shown that calls from birds such as falcons and eagles, when played, can deter seagulls and other birds from that area, as they are aware of the specific sounds their predators make. ‘The track we’ve helped create incorporates a number of different sounds from the mentioned bird of prey calls, high frequency sounds to white noise. ‘This is a great initiative to help the public enjoy their summer holidays without the threat of unwanted birds – all while not being harmful to them.” It’s now available on Spotify and YouTube, to be played whenever you next head to the beach – so your next chippy tea doesn’t end in tears.
