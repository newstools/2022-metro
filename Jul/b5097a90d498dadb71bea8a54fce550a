Louisiana-based rapper JayDaYoungan has died at the age of 24. The hip hop artist, real name Javorius Scott, was reportedly shot outside his home on Wednesday night and transported to hospital. However, Bogalusa Police Department have since informed TMZ that the rapper died of his injuries. He was initially said to be in critical condition after losing a lot of blood and required surgery. A second man, who was believed to be a relative of the rapper, was also shot. A police rep told the publication that one victim was rushed to hospital by someone on the scene, while the other, who was described as critically wounded, received treatment from paramedics before being taken to hospital. Shortly after news broke, a woman believed to be JayDaYoungan’s sister, said early reports he had died were false. She wrote using the Instagram handle @therealkenyajanelll: ‘B***h shut up y’all don’t know that the f**k y’all TALKING BOUT FR.” ‘Aint nobody f**king dead. Stop d**k eating and go read a f**king book.’ In another Instagram story, she added: ‘I hate you freak a** Internet a** n***as and h*es and bulls**t a** fake a** h*e a** blogs, h*e stop tryna confirm s**t y’all don’t f**king know bulls**t a**es.’ However, she later confirmed his death by writing: ‘Why did y’all do this to my brother why did y’all f*****g do this to my baby man,’ alongside several crying and broken-hearted emoji. Kenya Janell then reposted tributes to the rapper from loved ones. JayDaYoungan’s official DJ also reacted to the news, writing in a devastating Instagram post alongside a photo of them together: ‘This 🔪 Me Deep WTF 💔 My Brudda Mane 😭 I Just Wanna Think You For Everything You Did For Me💯 Real Sh*t I’ll Never Forget‼️ #On23 😢 R.I.H.’ The rapper rose to prominence after signing to Atlantic Records in 2017. He has since released several mixtapes and his debut album in June 2020. JayDaYoungan also caught the ear of his music peers, with collaborations including Latto, Lil Durk Boosie Badazz and Moneybagg Yo. In December, JayDaYoungan was indicted by a grand jury on a weapons charge and facing up to five years in prison. According to Knoe News, the musician was already under indictment in a Texas county, where he faced state charges of illegal possession of Oxycodone and assault on a pregnant woman. He was released from jail a month before his death and spoke of being on house arrest in his final Instagram post, shared just hours before the fatal shooting. The rapper was father to a young son who he often shared pictures of on social media. In one recent post to mark Father’s Day in June, he wrote: ‘Thanking God for letting me experience today with my favorite❤️ couldn’t ask for more but peace💯 Happy Father Day the real ones.’ Got a story?
