A family has paid tribute to their son after he died following a fight on the sports field. Misael Sanchez, 29, got into a disagreement with the referee in a soccer match at Oxnard High School, California, at 11am on July 10. This resulted in a melee between teams and spectators on both sides. Misael was knocked unconscious at the scene and taken to Ventura County Medical Center in a critical condition but died on Monday. Relative Guadalupe Sanchez confirmed his death on GoFundMe. She said: ‘It is with a heavy heart to share the passing of our beloved son, Misael Sanchez. ‘My family is heartbroken and still in disbelief, as we expected a bright future for him. ‘We were not ready for this type of goodbye. At this time, we are asking for your prayers, and if you can contribute financially, it will be greatly appreciated.’ Berlin Jose Melgara, 46, was arrested over his death, but other people may face prosecution following the fight at 11am on July 10. The cause of death is yet to be revealed. Commander Alex Arnett told NBC News: ‘The autopsy is really going to help us determine whether or not there was criminal conduct. ‘We understand that there was a fight on the field. We understand the victim was a participant in the fight. But we can’t say [whether] the fight is what resulted in the victim’s death.’ Investigators are ‘still searching for witnesses or anyone who might have video recorded all or part of the fight’. Anyone with information on the fight is asked to contact the police department. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
