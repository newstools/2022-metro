A toddler has been airlifted to hospital after being viciously attacked by a dog in Faversham, Kent. The child, who has not been identified, was taken by helicopter from a home in the Broomfield Road area. Police were called to the address at around 2.15pm yesterday and the dog was taken away from the property. The toddler was taken to a London hospital with a ‘number of injuries’, although none of them are thought to be life threatening, police have said. It follows a series of dog attacks in the UK in recent months, some of which have ended with life-changing injuries or death. Harley Chatterton, four, needed 60 stitches after being attacked by a one-year-old Jackador in Glasgow. Doctors warned her parents she may end up having permanent scarring as a result of the May 14 attack. That same month, three-year-old Daniel John Twigg was identified as the toddler killed by a dog outside a property in Rochdale. In March, 17-month old Bella-Rae Birch died after being mauled by her family’s pet dog in St Helens. Jack Lis, 10, was mauled to death by an eight-stone dog, dubbed ‘the Beast’ as he visited a friend in Caerphilly, South Wales last November. The dog’s owners, Brandon Hayden, 19, and Amy Salter, 29, were jailed in June. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
