The cast of Love Island will be among the only people in the world to have no idea that Boris Johnson has resigned as Prime Minister. Johnson reluctantly confirmed he will depart Downing Street after Tory MPs and key members of his cabinet quit and urged him to do the same. While the Love Island stars recover from the aftermath of Casa Amor, ITV won’t tell them about the drama that’s been kicking off back home. A spokesperson for Love Island confirmed: ‘They won’t be told – they have no contact with outside world as always.’ However, that’s not to say a new islander will come in at a later date and drop the news, even if accidentally. Back in 2018, Adam Collard revealed new contestants would often come into the villa and share some news. He received updated about the 2018 World Cup during his stint on the show. ‘The only information you get is when there is a new bombshell or a new islander coming into the house and then you start quizzing them,’ he told Heart. ‘We’re not supposed to ask, but when Sam Bird came into the house we pestered the life out of him and then he told us the England score for the first game, and then the girls in Casa Amor told us the second score.’ Tonight’s episode of Love Island is quite literally the moment fans have been gagging for – the Casa Amor recoupling. Laura Whitmore entered the villa and quite rightly  ‘scared’ Dami Hope, just one of the boys to fail the Casa Amor test. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
