Thousands of people basked in the sun today at beaches, parks and other areas, as temperatures hit 30°C. Extreme red heat warnings have been issued by the Met Office for Monday and Tuesday, where temperatures will hit 40°C in some parts of the UK. The Met Office issued its red warning, declaring the heat blast could spark ‘population-wide adverse health effects’. Forecasters also issued an amber weather alert from 12midnight to 11.59pm on Sunday, with experts warning it could lead to ‘potential serious illness or danger to life’. Huge crowds have been basking in the sun in areas like Margate, Kent. In Bristol, hundreds were seen out enjoying the sun around the harbour celebrating Bristol Harbour Festival. And in cities across the UK such as London, people have been making up for the lack of sand by sunbathing in parks. But people are being told to stay out of the heat on Monday and Tuesday and work from home where possible. The UK Health Security Agency has increased its heat health warning from level three to level four – a ‘national emergency’. Level four is reached ‘when a heatwave is so severe and/or prolonged that its effects extend outside the health and social care system… At this level, illness and death may occur among the fit and healthy, and not just in high-risk groups,’ it said. The Met Office red warning, for Monday and Tuesday, covers an area from London up to Manchester, and up to the Vale of York. Government scientists also say to avoid liquids like caffeine and alcohol because these make people urinate faster and lose more fluids from their bodies.
