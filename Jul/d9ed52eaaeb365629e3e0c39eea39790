Homes are under threat in east London as a large fire gets closer to buildings. Residents on Ballards Road in Dagenham have been evacuated after a grass fire spread. Eight fire engines are tackling the blaze, London Fire Brigade said this afternoon. All people living nearby have been asked to leave as the area is closed off. LFB has now declared a major incident as it faces extreme pressure in the dangerous British heatwave. At least 10 fires are raging across the capital after temperatures hit 40°C for the first time on record. Four of these appear to be major blazes, with an undisclosed number of people currently being treated by the London Ambulance Service. Police from Barking have raced to the Dagenham area to help local officers. Tweeting about the troubles the capital is facing, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ‘This is critical: London Fire Brigade is under immense pressure. Please be safe.’ Hours after the major incident was announced in the capital, Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service also declared one. They have warned people to only call them in emergencies as firefighters pour all their efforts into battling wildfires. The extreme weather comes after the United Nations warned in April that the world is on a ‘fast track’ to climate disaster. Mr Khan tweeted: ‘Today: Record temperatures. Tomorrow: Thunderstorms and warnings of flash flooding. ‘It’s not “just the summer”. It’s the climate crisis.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
