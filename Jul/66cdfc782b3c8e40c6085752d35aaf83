A murder investigation has been launched after a man died on a station platform following a fight on a train. Officers were called to Reading station at 11.43pm on Saturday night following a ‘needless act of violence’. They found an injured man, who died at the scene. Another man was arrested on suspicion of murder. He remains in police custody this morning. The British Transport Police (BTP) say they believe two men had an ‘altercation’ on board before the victim was assaulted on platform eight. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Langley has said officers are ‘still in the very early stages of our investigation’. ‘This is a needless act of violence which has resulted in the tragic loss of a man’s life’, he said. ‘Officers were quickly able to make an arrest at the scene and a man remains in custody this morning.’ The victim’s family has been told of the tragedy. They are being supported by specially trained family liaison officers. People who were in the area last night are asked to come forward to help police ‘piece together exactly what happened’. Detective Chief Inspector Langley said: ‘I would urge anyone who may have witnessed the incident or the moments before it to contact us as soon as possible.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
