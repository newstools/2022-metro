It looks like Danica Taylor’s blossoming romance with Billy Brown could be headed for a dead end in Tuesday night’s Love Island with fresh spoilers revealing he’s unconvinced there’s a ‘spark’. Fans have been rooting for the dancer and roofer after he made his feelings known with a snog in scenes that aired last week, however, it seems that their romance has well and truly fizzled. Well, for Billy at least. Having furthered their connection romantically, Billy and Danica catch up to discuss where things are going. ‘Now I am thinking, where is this going because if that click was going to come, it would have come,’ Billy tells her. Where does this leave Danica? Is Billy going to keep trying or will he cool things off? Is it time for Deji Adeniyi to shoot his shot? Elsewhere in tonight’s episode, Dami Hope and Indiyah Polack’s relationship looks to be heating up as they privately chat. Speaking about the future, Dami tells Indiyah: ‘I’ve been thinking about a lot of stuff, I think I’m going to move to London.’ Indiyah replies: ‘I think you should, I think London would suit you, not just because I am there, it doesn’t sound like a shabby plan to be fair.’ ‘But before I make that plan, you have to come to Ireland,’ Dami adds. Dami then says he’s got something more to say – but what surprise has he got up his sleeve? Love Island airs tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
