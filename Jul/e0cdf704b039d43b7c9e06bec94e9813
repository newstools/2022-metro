A man who admitted twice raping a 10-year-old girl who fell pregnant has been charged. Following the sexual attack Gershon Fuentes’ young victim had to travel from Ohio to Indiana for an abortion because of a change in the law by the Supreme Court. Ohio banned the procedure just hours after the Supreme Court voted in the much-maligned overturning of Roe v Wade. Fuentes was arrested on Tuesday and charged with rape. The case has drawn international criticism and President Joe Biden spoke about it before signing an executive order aimed at protecting access to abortion. He said: ‘A 10-year-old girl should be forced to give birth to a rapist’s child? Does anyone believe it’s Ohio’s majority view that that should not be able to be dealt with?’ The girl’s mother reported what had happened on June 22 and she was referred to children’s services in Franklin County. She went to Indianapolis on June 30 to have the abortion. DNA samples are being taken from the foetus to confirm that Fuentes was the rapist. Judge Cynthia Ebner said she was holding him on a $2 million to protect the girl and because he could try and flee the country. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
