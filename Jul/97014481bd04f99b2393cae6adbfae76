Boris Johnson apparently wasted no time in making a snipe at Rishi Sunak after he and Sajid Javid kickstarted a landslide of resignations last night. The prime minister is said to have thrown shade at his ex-Chancellor’s economic policies at a meeting of 80 loyal Tory MPs. According to Guido Fawkes, he told them: ‘I know you’re all avidly in favour of tax cuts, and tonight’s events might make that a bit easier to deliver.’ His alleged remark came after Mr Sunak told him ‘the public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously’ in a shock departure letter. ‘I recognise this may be my last ministerial job, but I believe these standards are worth fighting for and that is why I am resigning’, the former Cabinet minister wrote. Mr Sunak acknowledged that the pair had different approaches to managing the country’s purse strings. He said: ‘In preparation for our proposed joint speech on the economy next week, it has become clear to me that our approaches are fundamentally too different.’ In less than 24 hours, Mr Johnson has faced 28 resignations, with his government collapsing around him before his eyes. They include two Cabinet ministers, 13 ministers, 10 parliamentary private secretaries, one vice chair and two trade envoys. But the British leader has refused to step down, claiming the ‘colossal mandate’ he was handed by voters in 2019 means he should keep going, despite the ‘difficult circumstances’ he faces. He was forced to make a humiliating apology last night after finally being forced to admit he knew about sexual misconduct claims surrounding Chris Pincher when he made him deputy chief whip.
