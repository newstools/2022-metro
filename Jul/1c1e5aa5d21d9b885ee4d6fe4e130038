A child has been airlifted to hospital after being badly mauled by a dog in Canterbury. Police were called to a block of flats in the city shortly before 3pm today to reports of an attack. One eyewitness said the animal involved was a ‘big, pit bull type’, KentOnline reports. The child was flown by helicopter to a hospital in London and their condition is not yet known. A man was arrested in connection with the attack and police officers have seized the dog. A spokesman for Kent Police said: ‘Inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the incident are ongoing.’ It follows a series of dog attacks in the UK in recent months, some of which have ended with life-changing injuries or death. On Friday, a toddler was airlifted from Faversham in Kent to a hospital in London after a dog left him with a ‘number of injuries’. Harley Chatterton, four, needed 60 stitches after being attacked by a one-year-old Jackador in Glasgow. Doctors warned her parents she may end up having permanent scarring as a result of the May 14 attack. That same month, three-year-old Daniel John Twigg was identified as the toddler killed by a dog outside a property in Rochdale. In March, 17-month old Bella-Rae Birch died after being mauled by her family’s pet dog in St Helens. Jack Lis, 10, was mauled to death by an eight-stone dog, dubbed ‘the Beast’ as he visited a friend in Caerphilly, South Wales last November. The dog’s owners, Brandon Hayden, 19, and Amy Salter, 29, were jailed in June. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
