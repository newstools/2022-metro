The suspect in the deadly Fourth of July shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, has been indicted on 117 counts by a grand jury. Robert Crimo III is facing 23 counts of first-degree murder – three counts for each person killed when he fired from a rooftop into an Independence Day parade. Crimo, 21, was also charged with 48 counts of attempted murder and 48 counts of aggravated battery – two counts for each victim struck by a bullet at the massacre. Police found over 80 shell casings at the scene of the shooting, as well as the semiautomatic rifle used to carry out the attack, Lake County prosecutors said. Prosecutors also said that Crimo confessed to the attack when police apprehended him on July 4. ‘I want to thank law enforcement and the prosecutors who presented evidence to the grand jury today,’ Lake County State’s Attorney Eric Rinehart stated. ‘Our investigation continues, and our victim specialists are working around the clock to support all those affected by this crime that led to 117 felony counts being filed today.’ Crimo is expected to appear in court on August 3. A total of seven people were killed and over 30 wounded in the affluent Chicago suburb. The victims ranged in age from 8 to 88. One victim, 8-year-old Cooper Roberts, suffered a severed spinal cord from the attack. He was left paralyzed from the waist down. Authorities said that Crimo dressed like a woman to carry out the attack unnoticed and blended in with the crowd to escape. He was arrested hours later in Madison, Wisconsin. Police said he was considering another attack with a second rifle he had stored in his car. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
