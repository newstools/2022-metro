Stacey Solomon’s wedding to Joe Swash is right around the corner now, but she’s making the most of her time away by soaking up the sun on her hen do first. The Loose Women star will tie the knot with the former EastEnders actor later this month after several delays, both due to the pandemic and Stacey’s pregnancy. But now their big day is fast approaching and all their children can be there, since Stacey welcomed first daughter Rose on her birthday last year. Stacey recently jetted off with her sisters and closest friends for four days of pre-wedding celebrations, and she’s giving us all major FOMO with her snaps. Never one to leave her followers out of the action, the former X Factor star has been sharing the dreamiest pics and making us wish we were there, as she enjoyed a boat trip and went swimming in clear blue waters. The Essex gal doesn’t seem to have had anything but a smile on her face since her arrival, making plenty of core memories that’ll last a lifetime. Stacey shared a series of gorgeous photos from a boat trip, wearing a captain’s hat with ‘Bride’ written on the front in gems and donning an all-white ensemble, in preparation for when she walks down the aisle. Well and truly living her best life, Stacey threw her arms into the air as she posed in front of the clear skies and sparkling ocean, before also sharing a hilarious snap from her snorkelling adventures – always keeping it real, Stace! Fans have been absolutely living for Stacey’s hen party content, with one writing the comment: ‘You look amazing! Hope you are having the best time 🔥❤️’. ‘You are going to be an amazing bride,’ said another, while one added: ‘Thank you for always keeping it so real.’ The group of friends ended their day of splashing around in the sea and larking around on the boat by by watching the sunset from the boat, which just sounds lush, doesn’t it? Stacey and Joe will wed at their £1.2million Essex mansion – dubbed Pickle Cottage – which the crafty star has been busy decorating herself with gorgeous flower arrangements. Well, we’re hoping their nuptials are plain sailing, because fiancé Joe was rather stressed before Stacey headed for her hen week, leaving him with a list of chores and responsibilities. Don’t worry, Joe, she’ll be back soon. Got a story?
