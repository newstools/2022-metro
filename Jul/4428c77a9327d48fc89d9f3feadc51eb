A trophy hunter who killed elephants and lions has been murdered in South Africa. Riaan Naude, 55, owner of Pro Hunt Africa, was found dead next to his truck in Marken Road, Limpopo. Two hunting rifles were among items found in his car in an area which includes part of the Kruger National Park wildlife reserve, local outlet Maroela Media reported. Naude, from Phalaborwa, Limpopo, had previously uploaded pictures of himself posing next to dead animals, including lions, elephants and giraffes. Police spokesperson Lt.col. Mamphaswa Seabi said officers found his body after being called to the scene. He said: ‘The man was lying with his face up and there was blood on his head and face.’ Non-profit crime-fighting organisation the Heritage Protection Group (HPG) claimed Naude was shot dead by a man who pulled up alongside him when he stopped his car near Mokopane after it overheated. It claimed two men had stepped out of a white Nissan pickup truck, with one shooting him. HPG added they stole one of his pistols and left. A cattle herder heard a gunshot and saw the Nissan truck speeding away, according to reports. Naude’s Pro Hunt Africa company, located in northernmost South Africa, describes itself as a ‘hunting and Eco Safari outfit’.
