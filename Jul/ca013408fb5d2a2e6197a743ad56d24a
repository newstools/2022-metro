Vladimir Putin had to hold onto a table for support during a meeting with a top official. The warmonger, who has long been dogged by rumours of ill-health, held a firm grip as he listened to Russia’s top grain boss in Moscow. It appeared to be a carbon copy of a meeting Putin had at the same table last month. Footage showed the 69-year-old gripping the table so hard his veins started to bulge. These are just the latest in a long line of appearances coming under the spotlight amid reports of secret surgeries and body doubles. A clip from a recent awards ceremony showed Putin’s legs shaking as he swayed back and forth with his arms straight by his side. It is also widely believed he is taking steroids or receiving cancer treatment, which has left him looking puffy-faced. Professor Erik Bucy, a body language expert from Texas Tech University, told The Sun: ‘This is not a portrait of a healthy Putin but one appearing increasingly feeble and barely able to hold himself upright at a small conference table. ‘Putin’s legs also appear quite thin, as if he may be suffering from weight or muscle loss from an unannounced malady. ‘Bloating in his face reinforces an unhealthy appearance, especially compared to photographs and video of the Russian premiere from a few years ago.’ This is all comes amid reports that Kremlin officials are planning Russia’s future without Putin at the helm and lining up some possible successors.
