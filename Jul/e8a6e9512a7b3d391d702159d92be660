A hero dad is feared to have drowned after diving into Lake Garda to save his son. Aran Chada, 51, went missing after he slipped under the water while rescuing his child, 14, who had got into difficulty. The British sales director, from Leicestershire, had rented a boat with his family near the town of Limone in Italy. He had planned to celebrate his birthday with partner Holly, 39, and their daughter, aged around 7, and son, during their summer holiday. An urgent search was launched, with rescue boats, helicopters, divers and a robot submarine working into the night on Friday, but Mr Chada was not found. An incoming storm disrupted the search on Saturday but local services vowed they would not stop looking for him until he was found. Antonello Ragadale, a coastguard commander, told The Sunday Times Mr Chada may have suffered a seizure, but added that it was ‘very hot’ and easy to faint in the cold water after getting too much sun. The father ‘had no choice’ but to jump in, the coastguard commander added, saying: ’He did what any father would have done for his son.’ Ms Mosley and her two children have been assisted by counsellors following the traumatising incident. ‘This is a real tragedy, and the desperation in their faces was evident’,  Mr Ragadale said. The news is said to have left the family’s home village of Woodhouse Eaves in shock. The Foreign Office said: ‘We are supporting the family of a British man who has been reported missing in Italy and are in contact with the Italian police.’ It comes after an Italian man drowned in Lake Garda earlier this month, with another remaining missing following a separate incident. A tourist from east London died after attempting to swim a mile out to an island on the lake in 2017. Gary John Wood’s family desperately tried to save him but he suffered a suspected heart attack.
