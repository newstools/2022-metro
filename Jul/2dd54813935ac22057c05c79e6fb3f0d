One of Boris Johnson’s former lovers has said he will never resign as he believes his right to rule comes ‘from God’. Petronella Wyatt, whose four-year affair with the PM hit the headlines in 2004, gave her two cents as he battles to stay in power. ‘Boris will never resign,’ she hit out on Twitter. ‘He thinks he has a God given right to rule in perpetuity. ‘This is going to be long, drawn out and very bad for the Tory Party and the country. ‘There will be no government, as every minute of the day will be devoted to saving Boris.’ The journalist joined a chorus of Conservatives not pulling their punches when it comes to the beleaguered PM. Mr Johnson had to suffer through a brutal PMQs in a desperate attempt to prevent his government collapsing. In a particularly brutal moment, Keir Starmer labelled his frontbench ministers a ‘lightweight brigade’ who are only in office because no one else is ‘willing to debase themselves any further’. The resignations of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid began last night over the Chris Pincher affair, and continued today with a fresh wave of departures. Mr Javid humiliated his old boss in the Commons today as he explained in detail why he no longer had faith in him. Reading out a statement, he insisted he is ‘not a quitter’ but could not stand by Mr Johnson after it emerged he appointed Pincher as a deputy chief whip despite knowing about the sexual misconduct allegations against him. He suggested it was the final nail in the coffin after partygate and a string of scandals, saying: ‘Treading the tightrope between loyalty and integrity has become impossible.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
