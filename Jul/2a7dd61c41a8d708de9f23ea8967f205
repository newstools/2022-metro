As all of us across the UK roast in the fiery depths of hell (sorry, the UK heatwave),  plenty of celebs have taken to social media to suffer along with us. Don’t get us wrong, it’s a novelty to see a spot of sun, but the scorching temperatures are a bit much for us – and for many celebs, it seems. As temperatures reached above 31C on Tuesday, many including Stacey Solomon, Phillip Schofield, Rochelle Humes, and Ruth Langsford took to social media to share what they were up to. Hopefully, nothing more than star-fishing in front of a fan. Phil, who was on presenting duties at ITV, admitted he was ‘roasting’ as he headed home for the day in 29C. He was able to avoid the boiling rush hour tube that many face, but still admitted he was a little worse for wear. Sharing a red-faced selfie, he wrote on Instagram: ‘Trying to not look like it’s roasting.’ Stacey’s just headed home from her hen do, saying she was ‘back to reality’ as she filmed new episodes of her show Sort Your Life Out. From then, it was tackling mum life for her, as she tried to keep her kids out of the heat. Sharing a snap of baby Rose, she wrote: ‘We were up bright and early today (none of the kids sleep in this heat). ‘So we came to the garden for a splash around and then Rose & I headed off to work’. Ruth was on dog-walking duties with her pup Maggie – and that meant getting up bright and early! It’s advised to keep dog walks either early or late so as to keep pups out of the scorching sun. Sharing a video, she showed Maggie happily bobbing along in the shade. Christine is celebrating the start of the summer holidays with her kids she shares with husband Paddy – Penelope, Leo, and Felicity. Sharing a snap of the three of them splashing about in a paddling pool, she wrote: ‘My lifeys ❤️❤️❤️⠀‘School is closed for summer 😎 8 weeks off babies! Let’s make this the best one yet, let’s take adventures and explore new places, let’s laugh every day! Let me show you the way 🥰⠀‘Wishing you all a happy summer ☀️ Good luck to all the parents and carers juggling kiddies, work, life 🙃 Especially those who will struggle with the change in routine! 😅 We’ve got this 🙌.’ Rochelle might have been the envy of some, as she spent some of her day in an ice tub! The former Saturdays star was cheered on by her husband Marvin as she dunked herself in the freezing water, staying in there for two minutes and beating her past record.
