Flash floods have killed, injured and displaced dozens of people on an annual religious trip in India. Every year thousands of Hindus trek to the cave shrine of Amarnath in the Kashmir region. They make come to worship Lingam, a naturally formed ice stalagmite which they believe is an incarnation of Shiva – god of destruction and regeneration. The icy cave is covered in snow for the majority of the year, except for a short period in summer when it is open to pilgrims. An estimated 15,000 people were in the mountains this year, after the Covid pandemic cancelled the trip for the last two years. This year’s pilgrimage started on June 30 and was supposed to last for 43 days. But the trip was wrecked yesterday evening after a cloudburst (an extreme amount of rainfall in a short period of time) triggered a serious flood. Numbers are not yet final, as emergency teams are still working to get everyone to safety, but the death toll is currently 15. Dozens of injured people are being airlifted to hospital while at least 40 are completely missing. The majority of trekkers have been moved to the mountain’s lower base camp as their original camp was completely destroyed. The floods washed away some 25 tents and three community kitchens. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was ‘anguished’ by the disaster and sent his condolences to the victims’ families. He said he had made sure ‘all possible assistance’ was being provided. Usually the trip would end on August 11, when there is a full moon. Hindus believe the moon commemorates Shiva revealing the secret of the creation of the universe. It is unclear whether this trek will be able to continue. The pilgrimage is often a dangerous trip because of the harsh weather and icy mountains. In 1996, thousands of people were caught in a freak snowstorm during their trek, leading to more than 250 fatalities. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
