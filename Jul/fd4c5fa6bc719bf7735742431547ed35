Derek Chisora donned a Boris Johnson mask at the weigh-in for his fight with Kubrat Pulev, backing up his comments that he is a big fan of the politician. Chisora said at a press conference on Thursday: Listen, I got more pressure right now because Boris Johnson left No 10, you know? ‘That’s more pressure for me, because I was a big fan of Boris Johnson. I’m a big Brexit fan. ‘I love the Brexit. I was one of the members of Brexit. I’m all about things that bring pressure to life.’ The heavyweight has previously made his political feelings, backing Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, while in 2020 he laid out his own plans for the country. ‘If I was Mayor of London, I would take the congestion charge off. I’d keep the bike lanes. And buses free on a Thursday.’ Chisora told the Daily Mail. Chisora has a more pressing concern than London transport as he prepares to face Pulev at the O2 Arena on Saturday night. The Brit weight in heavier than his Bulgarian opponent on Friday, with Del Boy at 258lbs and the Cobra at 250lbs. Chisora is looking to end a three-fight losing streak which has seen him suffer defeats to Oleksandr Usyk and twice to Joseph Parker over the last two years. Pulev was knocked out by Anthony Joshua in December 2020, but got back to winning ways against Jerry Forrest in May this year and will be hoping another win helps set him back on the path towards another world title contest.
