The man suspected of abducting and potentially murdering Madeleine McCann likened the German prosecutor investigating him to Adolf Hitler. In a leaked prison letter, convicted paedophile Christian Brueckner said his life had been ‘destroyed’ by Hans Christian Wolters. He accused the prosecutor of ‘Hitler-like behaviour’ and said German police should ‘put up or shut up’. Brueckner, 45, is currently serving a seven-year term in Oldenburg prison for the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in 2005. He also has previous convictions for sexually abusing a six-year-old girl when he was 17 in 1994. According to German newspaper Bild, he ‘dropped his trousers’ to nine-year-old boy before fleeing. Brueckner has been the main suspect in the McCann case for two years, but so far he is yet to be charged. In his prison letter, seen by the Mirror, the convict said: ‘It is not on me to present evidence. Ask the prosecutor in the same overkill way like it happens with me. ‘Ask him why he destroyed the life of a human being by telling lies to the public in 2020.’ Brueckner was living in his van in Praia da Luz, Portugal, around the same time Madeleine vanished from her family’s nearby holiday villa. She disappeared on the evening of May 3, 2007, after parents Kate and Gerry McCann left her and her two siblings asleep while they ate with friends at a nearby restaurant. In April, Brueckner was declared an ‘arguido’ by Portuguese investigators – status for someone considered more than a witness who has not been arrested or charged. The McCanns were controversially made arguidos in September 2007, along with Robert Murat, but that status was lifted after no evidence emerged linking them to the disappearance. Maddie was three when she disappeared and would have turned 18 last year. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
