Hate to break it to you, but Hollywood lied – heat and sweat aren’t always romantic and sexy. History-making heatwaves are, among many other things, not exactly conducive to dating. Between climate anxiety and the sheer discomfort of 30+ degree heat in a nation in which air conditioning is not a staple, it’s hard to make temperatures that high feel sexy. Yes, the peak of this wave seems to be behind us, but even days that are a ‘normal’ level of hot can get in the way of a romantic vibe. Indeed, research from Badoo found that 48% of the singles who’d planned on going for a date last week had cancelled or were thinking of cancelling because of the heatwave. Over a quarter (27%) said they were worried about arriving to their date feeling hot and sweaty, whilst 26% would rather not make the effort when they know they’re not going to be feeling their best. That’s why Remy Le Fèvre, global head of communications at Badoo, has shared his top tips for hot weather dating. Even if you keep the above tips in mind and keep yourself safe from the sun, there’s still the matter of how the hot weather makes us feel. Not everyone’s a summer person, and even people who love the heat can feel their confidence getting knocked back a bit when they’re covered in sweat. Well, never fear, for Remy has some advice for that too… Do you have a story to share?
