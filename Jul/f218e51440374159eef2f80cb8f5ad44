If you’re a diehard Lush devotee, you’ll know all about Snow Fairy. It’s a bit of a fan fave – bright pink and candy floss sweet, you can grab the scent in the form of a shower gel, a bath bomb, a body spray, and more every Christmas. But we’ve always had to wait until the winter months to grab the range, and this has typically involved either ordering online or facing queues at the shops. Not this year, as from Saturday August 6 until Sunday August 21 (nope, that’s not long at all, so you’ll need to move fast), a Lush vending machine in Coal Drops Yard at King’s Cross, London, will have a full Snow Fairy takeover. That’s going to be super practical and handy for anyone travelling around London – you’ll be able to pick up Snow Fairy products 24 hours a day from the machine. In case you weren’t aware, the Lush vending machine opened back in March of this year, as a partnership with Anmac. It’s essentially a mini store, running on a low energy system with a simple touch screen service. When Lush launched the vending machine, they said it’d be open for six months, then they’d reflect on what happens next. Now, though, it’ll be a Snow Fairy popup, dedicated to the brand’s iconic Christmas scent. If you’re not based in London or planning a trip to the capital, however, don’t stress. Lush has also announced that their Christmas and Snow Fairy range will be available in Lush shops nationwide and on the website from Wednesday September 21 – so you won’t have to wait too long to nab your bath bits.
