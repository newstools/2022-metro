Love Island fans will see a potential shock result ahead of Monday night’s finale, as the remaining five pairs pick their least compatible couples tonight. We’re now well into the final week of the ITV2 dating show, and next week will see one couple crowned the winners by the public. However, this year is proving a close contest and with just five couples left, it seems as though there are still set to be plenty of twists in store. Now, it’s been confirmed a bombshell will be dropped on the islanders tonight, as they will be required to make a very difficult decision. Tonight, the couples all reflect on their epic dates, when Indiyah Polack receives a text. The islanders learn that they must, in their couples, vote for who they think are the two least compatible couples. They will then have to submit their decisions by text without discussing them with the other couples, meaning it really could go anyone’s way. As they deliberate over their decision, Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu gives Davide Sanclimenti a blunt reminder: ‘Let’s be real, this is not friend island, okay.’ Paige Thorne goes on to admit to Adam Collard: ‘It’s not nice at all.’ As they send their choices Indiyah asks her boyfriend Dami Hope: ‘Are we sure?’ With the results surely too close to call, which couples will be left at risk of being dumped? Who will just miss out on getting to the Love Island finale on Monday night? We’re already getting the popcorn ready… Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
