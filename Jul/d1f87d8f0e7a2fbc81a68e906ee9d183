A burst main on the Isle of Sheppey has left some people with no water supply in 28°C weather. Others are struggling with low water pressure on the island off the northern coast of Kent. Southern Water said they couldn’t put a number on how many properties have been impacted this morning, but said the maximum that could eventually be affected is 20,000. The company has apologised and said sharing bottled water at collection points is a priority. It comes as the Met Office issues an extreme heat weather warning into next week, cautioning some people may be at risk of serious illness or death. Some models have predicted temperatures as high as 40°C this weekend, although this is not definite. A water collection point is now open at Promenade Long Stay Car Park on the Isle of Sheppey, with others currently being set up. A statement from the firm sought to reassure customers, saying those on the company’s Priority Services Register will get water delivered to them. ‘We’re really sorry to customers on the #IsleofSheppey with low pressure or no water supply’, a spokesperson said this morning. ‘This is due to our repair work on a burst main in the area. Our priority is to set up bottled water collection points, and we’ll share locations and times soon. ‘We’re also continuing to make sure those on our priority service register have water delivered. ‘The team are working to get the repair finished as quickly as possible. We’re really sorry again for the disruption this situation will cause.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
