This is the hair-raising moment a little boy is almost wiped out by a pirate boat ride after climbing into a restricted zone. Shocking footage shows people shout ‘there’s a kid’ as he gets dangerously close to the giant swinging boat at Gulliver’s World in Warrington. The crowd then screams as the ship, packed full of riders, swings back down and he backs away just in time. A man then comes to the rescue, climbing the fence and grabbing boy before he is wiped out. Dad Andy Moore, from Manchester, was in the queue taking pictures with his child when he saw the boy run towards the ride. ‘The parent of the child was nowhere to be seen at first,’ he told MEN. ‘Then the staff member saw what everyone was shouting at and stopped the ride. ‘The child got very close to it and didn’t appear to realise the danger.’  He added: ‘Thankfully there were no injuries, but there is clearly an issue when a young child can easily climb the fence and enter the ride area. It could have been a lot worse.’ Gulliver’s World said staff responded quickly to the incident on Monday afternoon and reported it following the correct procedures. Resort director Craig Clewes said: ‘We are aware of an incident in one of the ride enclosures at Gulliver’s World. Our staff responded quickly and followed our safety and reporting procedures. ‘The safety of our customers and staff remains our number one priority.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
