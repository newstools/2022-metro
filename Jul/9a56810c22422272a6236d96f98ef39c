Conservative ministers have been caught smirking at the moment they were called the ‘charge of the lightweight brigade’ by Sir Kier Starmer. Dominic Raab, Nadhim Zahawi and Nadine Dorries were among those on the front bench seen reacting to the jibe. Sir Keir Starmer landed the comment during today’s heated Prime Minister’s Questions which comes as Boris Johnson’s premiership hangs by a thread amid a wave of resignations in protest of his leadership. Attacking Mr Johnson, Sir Keir said: ‘What a pathetic spectacle, the dying act of his career is to parrot that nonsense. ‘As for those who are left, only in office because no-one else is prepared to debase themselves any longer. The charge of the lightweight brigade. ‘Have some self-respect. ‘For a week he’s had them defending his decision to promote a sexual predator … anyone with anything about them would be long gone from his frontbench. ‘In the middle of a crisis, doesn’t the country deserve better than a z list cast of nodding dogs?’ The comments were met with cheers from the Commons. Ms Dorries, sitting next to the newly appointed chancellor Mr Zahawi was seen feigning a laugh while Mr Raab remained stoney-faced. Mr Johnson replied to the remark: ‘It’s exactly when times are tough and when the country faces pressures on the economy and pressures on their budgets, and when we have the biggest war in Europe for 80 years, that is exactly the moment that you’d expect a Government to continue with its work, not to walk away, and to get on with our job and to focus on the things that matter to the people of this country.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
