A schoolgirl was left ‘shaken up’ after a man attempted to snatch her in broad daylight, it has been reported. The 12-year-old said she was followed by a blue Ford van as she went to collect her younger brother from primary school in Basildon, Essex. The driver reportedly got out of the vehicle, tried to grab her but failed before chasing her down the road. ‘She’s shaken up and is scared to go to school,’ her mum told the Echo. ‘She wants to help others and she feels quite lucky but she worries others may not be. ‘He knew what he was doing and after watching her from his van, he parked up and got out. ‘It’s absolutely devastating and makes me sick to think people like that are in society and it’s so close to home too.’ The girl’s school has since warned parents about the incident, which happened at around 4.10pm on Wednesday. ‘Good morning. We have been made aware of an incident that happened in the area,’ the message read. ‘Someone in a blue transit van jumped out and tried to grab a child, they then chased them. They did not catch them. Please be vigilant.’ Police officers are urging anyone with information to call them on 101. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
