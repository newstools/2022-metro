A Tory police and crime commissioner who pledged a road safety crackdown has been banned from driving after she was repeatedly caught speeding. Caroline Henry has been banned from driving for six months after she was caught breaking a 30mph speed limit five times within a 12-week period. The PCC for Nottinghamshire Police previously admitted the offences, including two committed on consecutive days, telling a district judge: ‘I’m really sorry’. The 52-year-old, who was elected to the post in May 2021, was caught speeding in a blue Mercedes and a silver Lexus with a personalised number plate in 30mph zones at four locations in Nottingham in March, May and June last year. Henry was captured over the speed limit twice near a primary school in Daybrook, Nottingham, as well as roads in Chilwell, Beeston and on the city’s A610. Speed cameras clocked the PCC’s speed as high as 40mph in a 30mph zone, with other excess speeds recorded at 35mph and 38mph. Imposing a £2,450 fine as well as disqualifying her for six months at Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on Monday, District Judge Leo Pyle said of the offences: ‘What they show is that you are driving at consistent speeds above the speed limits.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
