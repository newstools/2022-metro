The ex-wife of 87-year-old Sir Frederick Barclay, who used to own The Ritz hotel, has called on a judge to jail him for failing to pay her massive divorce settlement. Sir Frederick was ordered to pay two £50 million lump sums to Lady Hiroko, 79, following the breakdown of their 34-year marriage. He says he doesn’t have the money but she insisted at the High Court that he did have the means to pay. She told judge Sir Jonathan Cohen in a written statement: ‘He has no respect for me or the court. ‘His aim is simply to string things out, hiding behind a web of complex structures (the initial purpose behind which was the avoidance of tax), allowing our daughter Amanda to fund all his financial needs, until one or other of us dies.’ Sir Frederick and his twin brother Sir David were among the UK’s most high-profile businessmen, with interests including the Telegraph Media Group and links to the Channel Islands and Monaco. Sir David died in January last year. The judge has criticised Sir Frederick, saying he behaved in a reprehensible fashion when he sold a luxury yacht and applied the equity for his own use. The tycoon’s lawyer Marcus Dearle said despite his best attempts, Sir Frederick had not yet been able to raise the lump sums. He added he was currently being financially supported entirely by his daughter, Amanda, by way of a loan and payments by way of gifts. But Lady Hiroko said: ‘Despite Frederick’s protestations of having no money, his life continues as before. ‘Financially he has everything he wants and needs. He takes great care to ensure funds do not come into his hands and certainly that they do not stay there.’ She is also seeking owed maintenance payments as well as legal fees. The hearing continues.
