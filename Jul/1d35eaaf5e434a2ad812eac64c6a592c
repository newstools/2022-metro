Want to ‘switch off’ from the world and relax? Well, look no further than this unique treehouse. Situated within the picturesque countryside of Llanafan-fawr, Wales, is a one-of-a-kind holiday home shaped like a conker. Dubbed ‘living pods’ by inventor, Jag Virdie, who is known for his luxury car designs for Bentley and Maclaren, the unique house is a must see. As you step inside, you are greeted with an intimate space which includes a kitchen nook and hob, a chest of drawers to store the essentials and a wrap-around seating area that folds out into a double bed. Outside, there are private loungers and a fire pit, making it the perfect spot for stargazing at night. If you wish to soak up the great outdoors, there’s also a deep-fill bathtub which overlooks the breathtaking countryside. There is very little mobile signal and internet connectivity in the are so turning off the outside world will be an easy task. Nature is all around, as the pod has its very own private woodland where you can enjoy your daily walk. Meanwhile, the local area is filled with moorland walks and a local pub where you can enjoy a great pint. You can also take a stroll to Elan Valley, where you’ll spot impressive dams and reservoirs, and, if you fancy some human interaction, the town of Builth Wells is only down the road. Described as a ‘ball of molten sunshine dropping from the sky’ the bespoke treehouse featured on George Clarke’s Amazing Spaces. And if you fancy staying there yourself, the ‘Earth Conker’ can be booked for £177 per night, with prices varying dependent on season and availability. Do you have a story to share?
