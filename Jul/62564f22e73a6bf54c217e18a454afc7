Chris Stuart, the BBC Radio 2 DJ and the mastermind behind quiz show Only Connect, has died at the age of 73. Broadcaster Stuart, who was also the commentator on Princess Diana’s funeral, was known as one of the ‘true greats’ of broadcasting. The BBC confirmed Stuart’s death in a statement, with Kate Phillips, director of Unscripted, paying tribute. ‘We are devastated to hear of the passing of Chris Stuart, the creator and executive producer of one of the BBC’s most popular quiz shows Only Connect, and previously a presenter on both BBC Radio Wales and the BBC Radio 2 Breakfast Show,’ she said. ‘He was an extremely talented and clever man and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this difficult time. So many people have benefited and learnt their craft from him, he leaves an incredible legacy behind.’ Stuart was one of the first hosts on BBC Radio Wales from 1978, before making his mark on BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio 4. He started on Radio 2 as a stand-in, and started hosting the early breakfast show full-time in 1988 after Ray Moore stepped down due to ill health. Stuart went on to host the late night show, before stepping down in 1992 – although he remained on as a stand-in for presenters like Ken Bruce and Gloria Hunniford. He was also known as the Westminster Abbey commentator, which led him to him being the commentator for Princess Diana’s funeral in 1997. Stuart also set up the production company Presentable with his wife Megan, which produced Only Connect, hosted by Victoria Coren Mitchell. The quiz show, which Stuart also acted as executive producer on, sees teams find connections between seemingly unrelated clues. It started airing in 2008 and is still wildly popular.
