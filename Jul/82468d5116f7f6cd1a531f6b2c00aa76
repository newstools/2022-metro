Chelsea are set to miss out in the race to sign Raphinha as Barcelona have submitted a £63 million offer to Leeds United, according to reports. Chelsea have already agreed a £55m deal with Leeds but the Brazilian winger has been putting off a move to Stamford Bridge as his preference has been to join Barcelona. However, the Spanish club have yet to reach an agreement with Leeds and Raphinha’s agent, Deco, has held several meetings with Barca’s hierarchy over the last few weeks in order to help push through a deal. According to MailOnline, that breakthrough could now be imminent as Barcelona have made a late move and tabled a £63m bid. The report claims that Barca have offered £55m up front plus a further £8m in add-ons. It’s understood that Raphinha already agreed personal terms with Barcelona back in March. Leeds are keen for Raphinha to resolve his future quickly after allowing him to miss their pre-season tour of Australia. Leeds have signed Colombian winger Luis Sinisterra and are stepping up their pursuit of Club Bruges forward Charles De Ketelaere. Chelsea, meanwhile, are on the brink of announcing Raheem Sterling as their first signing of the new regime. The England international started his medical with Chelsea on Sunday evening ahead of his £50m move from Manchester City. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
