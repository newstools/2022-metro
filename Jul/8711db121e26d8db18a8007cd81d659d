The baby wave bob is summer’s latest take on the bob cut. It’s short, beachy, and gives an effortless impression. Hair expert Nicole Petty at Milk + Blush says: ‘With the UK currently experiencing extreme temperatures, it’s hard to know what to do with our hair – other than resort to an updo that keeps it off your face. ‘However, there is one hairstyle that’s been trending recently – the baby wave bob. ‘Spotted on celebrities such as Nicole Scherzinger, Stacey Dooley and Ciara, this is a style that allows you to stay cool while looking chic and effortless.’ Ask for a blunt cut with soft, feathered and face-framing layers to add texture that allows you to style it in waves. The good thing about this cut is you can wear it as a ‘baby wave’ kind of bob, or transition it to a sleeker look. Nicole says: ‘An incredibly versatile look, the baby wave bob can be styled straight and more structured for a sleek evening look, or wavy and beachy for a super chilled daytime/ relaxed vibe. ‘You can add as little or as much product as you wish to achieve the look you desire, too.’ The key is loose, beachy waves that add texture without appearing too refined and prim. Nicole says: ‘For straight or fine hair, let your hair air dry, leave it in plaits overnight or use a curling wand and style the hair in different directions before brushing it out to achieve loose, soft waves. ‘And for curly hair, embrace its natural texture by adding salt or texturising sprays throughout to emphasise the shape.’ The parting is up to you – it works to the side or set in the middle. Nicole believes this style is definitely here to stay this summer, saying ‘it allows women to look elegant without having to fuss about what to do with it in the heat’. Do you have a story to share?
