A parish council was left red-faced when cannabis was spotted growing in their flower display. The ‘beautiful’ 6ft long planter was meant to bring a spot of colour to a roadside in West Parley, Dorset. But the plan went awry when a local gardener who was passing by made the ‘hilarious’ find – with suspicions the display was ‘tampered’ with. Volunteers had been taking care of the plants every day, while the council had posted on social media saying they were ‘looking lovely’. Tray Veronica, the gardener who noticed the problem, said: ‘It was last Sunday I spotted the plants. I was taking my child to a friend’s house. ‘I just found it hilarious. The council were looking after these planters every day. ‘All the other plants are still in the planter. It’s just the cannabis that’s been removed. ‘The planters do look so beautiful. The council did a great job with them and I’m sure this was just someone’s idea of a joke.’ The offending plant was ‘not part of this year’s schedule’, a spokesperson for West Parley Parish Council has said. It has been removed and checks have been made on other plants in the area. ‘On 20th July, the parish council was alerted to a report concerning one of the village’s floral displays, which suggested it may have been tampered with and amongst the flowers was a plant not part of this year’s schedule’, a statement from the council read. ‘On the advice of the police, the plant was located, removed and has been secured by the parish council and arrangements are being made to pass it on to Dorset Police for identification and destruction. ‘An inspection has taken place of all the parish’s other planters, and this has not raised any further concerns.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
