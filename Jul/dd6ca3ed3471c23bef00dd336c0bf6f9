England Women’s manager Sarina Wiegman believes her side were not at their best in their Euro 2022 victory over Austria but she is still happy with the win. In the opening game of the tournament, the Three Lionesses edged Austria 1-0 with Beth Mead scoring the decisive goal in the 16th minute of the match. However, it was not the greatest performance from the hosts, who laboured against a stubborn Austria side and while they did create some great chances, a  lack of ruthlessness prevented England from adding to their lead. Speaking to BBC Sport after the match, Wiegman said: ‘I’m not frustrated. I just think we can do better. ‘After the first goal we had a huge chance. We have to be a little calmer in the final stage. We should have scored a couple of times and made it easier. ‘The first game in a tournament, it’s so important to win and have a good start. We have shown different phases – some good, some not so good. ‘We started not very good. We did a lot better [then]. The second half we created chances but were too sloppy on the ball.’ Wiegman lead the Netherlands to victory at the last Euros in 2017 and she is yet to lose a game since taking over England last September, with this their 13th win in 15 games. The match was played at Old Trafford in front of a raucous crowd of 68,000, a record attendance for the Women’s Euros. Wiegman added: ‘Overall I’m really happy. Don’t underestimate Austria. They’re a good, strong organised team. ‘It [the atmosphere] was so incredible. It’s hard to have an influence because the players can’t hear you. But that’s what we want.’ England’s Euro 2022 campaign continues on Monday with their next Group A game against Norway.
