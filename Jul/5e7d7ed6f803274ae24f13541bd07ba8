Temperatures are set to head towards 40°C in parts of the UK over the next week so keeping our cats and dogs cool is crucial. However, more than one in three people still don’t know the symptoms of heatstroke in their dog or what to do if they’re suffering. Taking care of pets, as well as farm animals and local wildlife, is important as the heat worsens. The RSPCA says it could be a ‘matter of life or death’ for pets. Esme Wheeler, dog welfare expert at the RSPCA, said: ‘The hot weather has gone from glorious to extreme, and we can’t stress enough how vital it is that pet owners take the situation seriously. ‘That means limiting or skipping walks, only taking very essential car journeys, leaving water available at all times, and preparing damp, cold towels and mats, and frozen treats. ‘We’re still getting reports of dogs being left in cars, and seeing a lot of dogs being taken to busy outdoor events like festivals, shows and fetes, and to the beach. ‘Don’t be that person who is dragging their panting dog along the pavement or plodding around a garden show. ‘We can’t stress this enough – please leave them at home in the cool where they’ll be safe.’ If you do notice the above signs of heatstroke in your dog, there are variety of steps you can take. Stop the animal from exercising if out and about and move them into a shaded or cool area, the RSPCA has advised. Offer small amounts of liquid and, if there’s one to hand, place a soaked cool towel over their head. The towel should be replaced once it heats up. Once these steps are taken, dog owners should call a vet straight away for further advice. There’s also a variety of tips on how to prevent heatstroke in the first place, which you can read below.
