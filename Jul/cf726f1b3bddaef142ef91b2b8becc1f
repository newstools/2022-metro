Love Island has been flooded with 3,617 Ofcom complaints in just one week following the explosive fall out from Mad Movies and claims of misogyny. The ITV2 show has been condemned by Women’s Aid over the ‘controlling behaviour’ exhibited in recent scenes on the popular dating series after the contestants were shown footage of each other’s Casa Amor antics. Over the course of the past seven days, Luca Bish has been seen blowing up at partner Gemma Owen while accusing her of ‘flirting’ with Billy Brown despite her insisting she wasn’t ‘entertaining’ the bombshell’s advances. Elsewhere, Davide Sanclimenti repeatedly branded Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu a ‘liar’ during explosive arguments, despite himself straying and kissing Coco Lodge in Casa Amor. An astonishing 2,481 viewers contacted the television watchdog on Sunday over the misogynistic behaviour by some of the male contestants. During the episode, Luca was unconvinced Gemma wasn’t flirting with Billy in the clips, and he fumed to the boys: ‘I don’t even want to talk to her tonight. Made me look like an absolute f*****g w****r  I ain’t going f*****g near that bird.’ Following the shocking scenes, Luca’s family insisted they do not condone his behaviour and said he would be ’embarrassed and deeply apologetic’ watching it back. A further 427 people reached out to Ofcom following Sunday’s episode of Aftersun to hit out at the comments made about Ekin-Su and the treatment of Jacques O’Neill, who quit the villa, during his interview with Laura Whitmore. During his chat with Laura, Jacques was asked about his decision to leave the show, on top of being quizzed about his ex-girlfriend Gemma Owen also being on the series. On Monday, the regulator received 413 complaints relating to alleged bullying and misogynistic behaviour from some of the male contestants. The episode in question saw Luca pick Tasha Ghouri as the islander riding on the back of her partner’s coat tails and using Andrew Le Page to get further in the contest. This caused major tension within the group, with Andrew eventually confronting the boys after hearing them bitching about him. Prior to that, 167 complaints were lodged following last Friday’s episode, with viewers taking issue with footage of Ekin-Su and George during Casa Amor. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2.
