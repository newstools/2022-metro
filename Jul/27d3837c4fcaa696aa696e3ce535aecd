Nicola Adams and her girlfriend Ella Baig recently welcomed a new addition to their family after welcoming a baby boy together! The couple were overjoyed to share the news, with the Olympian saying she ‘can’t believe’ the pair are officially parents. Their love story goes back four years, with the pair meeting in 2018 – and they’ve only gone from strength to strength ever since. And now they’re officially parents! From meeting outside a club to buying a place together and sharing their pup Brooklyn, it’s been quite the journey so far. The couple met in 2018 outside a nightclub, after Nicola, 39, overheard Ella, 24, admitting to a friend that she didn’t know who she was. At this point, Nicola had won gold in the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, so people were asking her for photos – but not knowing who she was seemed to pay off for Ella. ‘I remember being outside the club with my friend, and I’d had a couple of drinks,’ the model told The Sun. ‘But someone took a picture of her and I turned around and you know when you’re drunk and you do that loud whisper… I turned to my friend and went, “Why is everyone asking for pictures of her, she’s not even that fit?” ‘She heard me say that but she liked the fact I didn’t know who she was, as rude as I was. We carried on talking for quite a while and it went on from there.’ Things got serious fairly quickly between the pair, and after one year of dating, they bought a house together in Leeds. The couple live together in a gorgeous home, which features a huge garden, and a private gym. Also sharing the home is their bulldog Brooklyn, who has his own Instagram and has even featured with the pair on Celebrity Gogglebox. Nicola was already a household name thanks to her sporting achievements, but saw more success with her appearance on Strictly Come Dancing, which saw her appear as part of the first-ever same-sex pairing with Katya Jones. Sadly, the pair had to withdraw due to a positive Covid-19 test, but their impact on the competition was huge, with the pair also paving the way for John Whaite and Johannes Radebe to appear (and reach the final) as the first all-male pairing. Ella wasn’t fazed by the ‘Strictly Curse’ (which some claim have led to couples breaking up while one of them competes on the show). She told The Sun at the time: ‘I’m not worried about the curse. Nicki and me are best friends so I don’t really see anyone as competition and she doesn’t either. ‘The grass is never greener on the other side and me and Nicki have a lot of history together, so I don’t think anyone is going to steal her off me. ‘We did have a conversation about the “curse,” and we agreed I would meet her dance partner so there are no hard feelings or jealousy there.’ The same year, the couple made a series of TV appearances together on Celebrity Gogglebox (along with pup Brooklyn of course). They gave their takes on the best British TV of the week alongside Laura Whitmore and her boyfriend Iain Stirling, and Zoe Ball and her son Woody. Earlier this year, Nicola and Ella announced they were expecting their first child together ‘after what feels like a lifetime’ of IVF. Nicola revealed they had been trying for three years to have a baby using her egg and a sperm donor who resembles Ella. In a joint Instagram post along with a picture of them kissing and another of the baby’s scan, they wrote: ‘We’re so excited to announce that our family is expanding. ‘After what feels like a lifetime, we can finally say we’re going to be parents! We’re so excited to share this magical journey with you all, the ups, the downs everything in between ‘Welcome to the world little one.’ The sports star, who was the first woman to win a boxing Olympic gold medal, detailed their fertility journey in Vogue magazine. ‘We decided that Ella would carry the baby, that we’d use my egg, and find a sperm donor that resembled Ella, she said. ‘Unbeknownst to us, Ella went through her first rounds of IVF with an underactive thyroid which can dramatically impact the chances of having a healthy pregnancy.’ The star also revealed that their first round of treatment failed as Ella suffered a miscarriage. Earlier this month, Nicola and Ella confirmed the news that they’d welcomed a baby boy. In a statement, the boxer and Strictly Come Dancing star, shared her pride and love for Ella. Nicola said: ‘We are so excited to have welcomed our son into the world on Saturday morning at around 7am. Nothing prepares you for this moment in life but I am so overwhelmed with love and proud of Ella.’ She added to Hello: ‘We can’t wait to start this new chapter with baby Adams.’ They’ve since been pictured leaving the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital with the newborn, with Nicola writing: ‘Can’t believe it, it’s official me and @ella.baig are parents now 😆 @babyadamsadventures can’t wait to get you home 👶🏽🙌🏾 ❤️ #twomums #babyboy.’ Got a story?
