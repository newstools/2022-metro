Ever wanted to step into an A-ha music video? Well, now you can live your 80s cartoon fantasy in the Ink Café in Qatar, which looks just like a drawing. This black and white café is designed to look just like 2D art, with inky outlines on everything from the floor to the furniture. One visitor, Saad Halideen, has shared footage of what it’s like inside. Instead of photos on the walls, there are drawings and outlines of frames. The chairs and tables have black edges, giving the illusion of an ink outline. There’s even a carpet pattern drawn on the floor, and ‘cushions’ rendered on the backs of booths. He said: ‘The café is located at a market in Qatar and the unique design attracts lots of customers. ‘Not only is the design amazing, but the service and quality of coffee are great too. ‘It’s the only place in Qatar that is designed this way, it’s fascinating and grabs everyone’s attention. ‘I decided to visit because it was so different from any café I’d ever seen before.’ Do you have a story to share?
