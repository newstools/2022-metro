Lauren Goodger’s ex-boyfriend Jake McLean has died in a horror car crash in Turkey that has left Towie star Yazmin Oukhellou seriously injured in hospital. According to reports, McLean, 33, was driving in Bodrum when he lost control of the car. Emergency crews rushed to the scene, but sadly he couldn’t be saved. It’s understood that Yazmin is being treated for her injuries in intensive care. A source told The Sun Online: ‘Apparently Jake was driving when he lost control of the car and it went off a cliff.’ ‘It’s a complete tragedy and a total loss of life,’ an insider added to Mail Online. ‘Everyone is in shock and is hoping Yazmin makes a full recovery.’ Yazmin and McLean have been dating on and off since 2019 after she broke up from her long-term relationship with James Lock. The reality star confirmed her relationship with Jake in an Instagram video in December 2021. ‘So finally, I’ve announced my boyfriend on Instagram. I’ve been keeping it a secret for how long?’ she said. Jake then replied: ‘It’s only been a year!’ However, reports claim they broke up just a few months after. McLean and Lauren began dating in 2012 and the couple was in a relationship until 2016. While details of the fatal crash currently remain few and far between, Yazmin’s fans have been flooding her last social media post with their thoughts and prayers. ‘Praying for you at this sad time😢,’ wrote one.
