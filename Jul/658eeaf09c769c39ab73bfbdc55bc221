Sunburn is never funny, but some tan lines are more unfortunate-looking than others. From strange lines and patterns to painfully bright red skin, there’s a cocktail of burns out there roaming Britain’s streets this summer. According to research carried out by Medino, 77% of UK residents over the age of 18 don’t wear sunscreen to protect themselves from the UK sun. This is because there’s an idea that isn’t not needed here, compared to countries abroad – but this is horribly wrong. Exposure to the sun increases the skin of developing skin cancer and skin ageing – and this week temperatures are set to soar. So, before you scroll and laugh at this collection of terrible tan lines, remember this week to wear SPF, top it up, and seek out shade. You don’t want to be one of the painfully sun-damaged people we feature next time… Got a sunburn or tanline that’s worse than the above?
