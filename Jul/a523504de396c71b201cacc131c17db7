At least 15 people have died in a Russian rocket attack on a five-storey block of flats in east Ukraine. More than 20 could still be trapped under the rubble after the strike on Chasiv Yar, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk region. The Saturday night rocket assault is the latest in a recent burst of high-casualty attacks on civilian structures. At least 19 people died when a Russian missile hit a shopping centre in the city of Kremenchuk in late June and 21 people were killed when a block of flats and a recreation area came under rocket fire in the southern Odesa region earlier this month. Russia has repeatedly claimed it is only hitting targets of military value. Mr Kyrylenko said Uragan rockets – fired from trucks – were used on Chasiv Yar. The town of about 12,000 people is about 12 miles south-east of Kramatorsk, a city expected to be a major target of Russian forces as they grind west. The Donetsk region is one of two provinces along with Luhansk that make up the Donbas region, where separatist rebels have fought Ukrainian forces since 2014. Last week, Russia captured the city of Lysychansk, the last major stronghold of Ukrainian resistance in Luhansk. After the seizure, some analysts predicted that Moscow’s troops would pause to rearm and regroup before pressing on. But Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai said Russian forces are raising ‘true hell’ in the Donbas. He said: ‘So far there has been no operational pause announced by the enemy. He is still attacking and shelling our lands with the same intensity as before.’ He later said Russia had been forced to suspend operations when Ukrainian forces destroyed ammunition depots and barracks.
