Fancy becoming richer than Adele this weekend? Thought you might. Brits have the chance of scooping £191 million on Friday – the biggest EuroMillions prize of all time. The eye-watering jackpot is being rolled over after everyone across the nine countries that play lost out on Tuesday. The jackpot is now at its cap, meaning any money which would have boosted it even further will now go towards prizes in the next winning prize tier. Whoever scores it will be instantly richer than Adele (said to be worth £185 million), Miley Cyrus (reported to be worth £134 million) and Harry Styles (believed to be worth £75 million). They would be able to purchase not one, not two, but three £55 million townhouses in London’s Mayfair – with money to spare. Let’s not forget they come complete with steam-rooms and plunge pools, cinema rooms and fully-equipped chef’s kitchens. If someone in the UK won, we would become the luckiest EuroMillions nation, beating France’s 117 wins since the draw began in February 2004. Andy Carter, senior winners’ adviser at The National Lottery, said: ‘Friday will be massive, with a jaw-dropping estimated EuroMillions jackpot of £191 million up for grabs. ‘Here’s hoping that we’ll be celebrating our biggest-ever UK winner. Think of all the good that a win of this size could do. ‘Players should get their tickets early to be in with a chance of winning in this amazing draw.’ There have already been three UK EuroMillions’ jackpot winners this year. The most successful of which were Joe and Jess Thwaite from Gloucester, who bagged a record-breaking £184 million EuroMillions jackpot in May.
