A temple dating back 4,500 years has been uncovered by archeologists in Egypt. The remnants of the mud-brick building are believed to be one of the lost ‘sun temples’ dating back to the Fifth Dynasty of ancient Egypt (2465 to 2323 BC). They were found under the temple of King Nyuserre in the Abusir region, south of Cairo. The Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism announced the thrilling new find on Instagram on Saturday. ‘The joint Italian-Polish archaeological mission, working at the temple of King Niussere in Abu Ghorab, north of Abu Sir, discovered the remains of a mud-brick building below the temple,’ a statement said. ‘The discovery hints that the remains might belong to one of the lost four solar temples from the Fifth Dynasty, known only in historical sources but yet to have been found thus far.’ Part of the building was demolished by the pharaoh – the sixth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period – to build his temple, the ministry added. The team excavated several pots and beer glasses inside the building, which will help the team with their research. Some muddy stamps bearing the names of kings from the Fifth Dynasty were also unearthed. Photos shared by the ministry show the site where archeologists are still working. The first sun temple to the god of Ra was discovered in the 19th century, so this is an important find, which could help scientists’ understanding of ancient Egyptian history. Only two out of six or seven such temples have been uncovered in the country to date. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
