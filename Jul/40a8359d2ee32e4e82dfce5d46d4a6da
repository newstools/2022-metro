Two people were killed and two others injured in a series of shootings overnight in Canada. Emergency alerts warned of ‘multiple shooting scenes’ just after 6am local time in Langley, a city 30 miles east of Vancouver, in British Columbia. Two men were found dead, while another man was wounded in the leg. An injured woman was also rushed to hospital and is now in a critical condition. They were shot by a lone gunman, detectives believe, who was identified as Jordan Daniel Goggin. The 28-year-old suspect was later shot and killed by police officers, chief superintendent Ghalib Bhayani told a news conference. It’s believed Goggin, who was known to local officers ‘but had non-criminal contact’, was targeting homeless people in the city. An investigation into the shooting, including a possible motive, is underway, but the names of the victims have not yet been released. Harrowing photos from the scene show two black SUVs, similar to those used by emergency tactical units, with several bullet holes in the windshield and windows. ‘We are still investigating to determine if the gunman had acted alone,’ Bhayani said. ‘While the investigation is ongoing, all indications are that there was nobody else involved and there is no further ongoing threat to public safety.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
