The biggest ever EuroMillions winner could take home £191 million next week after the enormous jackpot rolled over. There were no winners in Tuesday’s £186 million draw so lottery bosses are adding another £5 million to the kitty. You will have to overcome odds of 139,838,160 to one, but if you do match all the numbers on Friday, you would instantly become five times richer than singer Dua Lipa, who is worth an estimated £36 million. You could even afford to buy a home on London’s billionaire row, where houses sell for as much as £75 million, or even the luxurious Doughty House manor in Richmond for a cool £100 million. The lucky winner would topple current British record-holders, Joe and Jess Thwaite, from the top spot. The couple from Gloucester scooped a record-breaking £184 million less than two months ago. Andy Carter, senior winners’ adviser at The National Lottery, said: ‘Friday will be huge – with an incredible estimated EuroMillions jackpot of £191 million up for grabs, we could be celebrating our biggest-ever winner. ‘Think of all the amazing communities that could benefit from a win of this size. Players should get their tickets early to be in with a chance of winning in this amazing draw. ‘Thanks to National Lottery players, more than £30 million is generated every week for Good Causes across the country. ‘This supports everything from local projects making a difference where you live, to our nations’ athletes at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.’ Tuesday’s main EuroMillions numbers were 07, 10, 25, 45, 48 – while the lucky star numbers were 03 and 06.
