A woman in her 50s has died and two others are injured after being hit by a double decker bus in Manchester. The group was at a bus stop in the Piccadilly area of the city centre when tragedy struck on Sunday night. A woman, also in her 50s, is in hospital with serious injuries following the collision. A man in his 60s was treated for minor injuries shortly after 9.30pm. One eyewitness told the Manchester Evening News: ‘I just saw the bus suddenly mount the kerb and crash into the bus stop. ‘There were hundreds of people standing around trying to help. The police were here within minutes.’ The bus driver remained at the scene to help officers as an investigation was launched. Stagecoach Manchester has confirmed one of its vehicles was involved in a ‘serious incident’. A spokesman said: ‘Our first thoughts are for those affected by the incident and their families. ‘Safety is our absolute priority and we are supporting the investigation into the circumstances involved in any way that we can.’ The road was taped off between Oldham Street and Lever Street until around 6am this morning and the bus stop outside Travelodge remains closed. Officers are appealing for anyone with dash or helmet-cam footage of the collision, or the area in the moments beforehand, to get in touch.
