Florence Pugh looked fabulous in a sheer pink Valentino gown on Friday night, where she chose to free the nipple – and then joke about it on social media afterwards. The star of Midsommar and Black Widow attended the Valentino Haute Couture Fall/Winter 22/23 fashion show in Rome Italy in head-to-toe bright pink. Her gauzy gown featured a flowing tulle skirt and see-through halter-neck top with ruffled collar, which the 26-year-old paired with a matching square earrings and ring set and towering platform heels. Letting her dress do most of the talking, the actress opted for natural make-up and wore her short blonde hair slicked back. Taking to Instagram following the event – where she rubbed shoulders with fashion royalty including Vogue’s Anna Wintour – Florence shared pictures of herself at the event to her grid. ‘Technically they’re covered?’ she pointed out in her caption, referring to the sheer nature of her dress. ‘Feeling magical in @maisonvalentino 🌸,’ she added. ‘@pppiccioli you absolute genius. Stunning. Stunning. Stunning evening.‘Thank you again, my beautiful team, for making my pink princess dreams come true.’ She also shared a tongue in cheek picture of herself to her Instagram Stories, first posted by her make-up artist  Alex Babsky, in which she covered each nipple with her index finger and gazed upwards and into the distance. Florence’s followers were wowed by her look, with one commenting: ‘Florence my lord my everything my lifeline 🙏🏻🧎‍♀️🧎‍♀️’ Another posted: ‘I personally love a technicality.’ ‘In love. Date me,’ shared singer-songwriter Ashe. The actress is next to appear in Don’t Worry Darling opposite Harry Styles, the trailer for which had fans all flustered after it dropped and showed the two sharing a few intimate moments – including one on the top of the dining table. Set in a 1950s utopian experimental community, Florence plays Alice, who becomes worried that her husband (Styles) and his glamorous company might be hiding disturbing secrets as he toils away on the mysterious Victory Project. Don’t Worry Darling is scheduled for release in cinemas on September 23. Got a story?
