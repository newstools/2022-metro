England remain on course to become European champions after they produced a brilliant comeback to beat Spain and reach the semi-finals of Euro 2022. The Lionesses were bidding to reach their fourth successive semi-final at a major tournament but appeared to be heading out after Esther Gonzalez put Spain in front in the second-half. Pre-tournament favourites Spain led for 30 minutes but Ella Toone equalised late on to keep England alive, before Georgia Stanway settled the quarter-final with a stunning winner in extra-time. Sarina Wiegman’s England, still unbeaten at Euro 2022, will play Sweden or Belgium in the semi-finals on Tuesday night.
