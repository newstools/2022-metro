Bad hair days will soon be a thing of the past. A Brooklyn-based hair brand that’s been a hit in the US has made its way across the pond and is now on sale in the UK. The brand, named amika (which means ‘friend’ in Esperanto), has 10 different collections – so there’s something for every hair type, texture and style. The team at amika is made up of creatives, hairstylists, chemists and hair enthusiasts – so you know you’re in good hands. What’s more, products are cruelty-free and are made without harsh sulfates, parabens or phthalates – with prices starting from £14. They also come in 100% recyclable packaging, with free recycling through Terracycle – which means they’re better for the planet, too. So there’s never been a better time to upgrade your hair routine. Some of the brand’s bestsellers include a Perk Up Dry Shampoo – which offers a freshly-washed look with no white residue. Instead, it restore hair’s volume without the itchiness, gunk or powder. There’s also the Bust Your Brass purple shampoo – ideal for toning and hydration – as well as Flash: a fast-acting rinse out treatment mask that boosts shine, hydrates, and softens hair in just 60 seconds. Alternatively, if you’re looking to strengthen and nourish hair, the Kure Bond repair collection is another popular choice. Browse some of the amika products here.
