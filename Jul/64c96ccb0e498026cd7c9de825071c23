Wimbledon 2022 has served up plenty of action for tennis fans – from the shock defeat of favourites like Serena Williams and Emma Raducanu to Nadal having to withdraw due to an injury. The last hope for a Brit in the final was dashed when 2021 returning champ, Novak Djokovic, beat Cameron Norrie to earn his spot in the final. Djokovic will be facing off against Australia’s Nick Kyrgios in the final, but have the two faced off before? The two tennis titans have faced off before – twice. In fact, they had a bit of a rivalry in the past – something which Kyrgios has claimed is now a ‘bromance.’ And, in both matches, the Aussie Kyrgios got the best of the 20-time Grand Slam winner Djokovic. Both times the two faced off was in 2017 – at the Indian Wells Masters and in the Mexican Open. During the Indian Wells game, Kyrgios beat Djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (3). During the Mexican Open at Acapulco, the sets went 7-6 (9), 7-5 to Kyrgios. In both matches prior, Kyrgios not only won, but he did so without dropping a set and without dropping serve. The Wimbledon men’s singles final will take place at 2pm on Sunday July 10. Either Djokovic or Kyrgios will not only walk away with the pride of victory, but also pocketing an impressive £2,000,000 in prize money. You can catch all the action live on BBC One, or stream it online on the BBC Sport website. BBC Radio 5 Live will also provide live commentary and expert analysis.
