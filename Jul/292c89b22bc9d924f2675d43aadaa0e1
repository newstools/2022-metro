An army captain has returned home from an overseas posting to a giant banner accusing him of having an affair. Pictures shared on social media show the sign on the side of a house with balloons and a so-called ‘confession’. His scorned wife claimed the Royal Army Medical Corps officer cheated on her with a United Nations official while he was in war-torn Somalia. The banner reads: ‘Hello, my name is Captain [surname]. I went on tour to Somalia and had an affair with [name] who works for the UN. It adds: ‘I kicked my wife out of our house and rendered her homeless, unemployed and broken.’ The banner, which features a picture of the soldier in uniform holding a dog, also mocks the Army’s leadership code about integrity being key to an officer’s role. It says: ‘I lack moral courage, discipline, respect for others, integrity, loyalty, selfless commitment.’ The house is believed to be on a married quarters estate in Colchester, Essex. The couple have not been named. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ‘We are aware of a social media post which makes allegations against a service person. ‘This matter is under investigation.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
