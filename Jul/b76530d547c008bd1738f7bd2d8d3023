The Duchess of Cambridge stepped out alongside Prince William today in a striking blue spotty number – for her first appearance at Wimbledon this year. Her outfit of choice – a long sleeved, blue polka dot dress – was perfect for an afternoon of watching tennis. Kate and William took their seats in the Royal Box to watch defending champion Novak Djokovic and Italy’s Jannik Sinner in their quarterfinal match. The duchess’ Alessandra Rich dress retails at £1,515 – although, it’s currently on sale for £454 via The Outnet. And the dress was a classic choice for the royal, echoing her signature style – with its midi design, nipped-in waist and subtle detailing. It’s also a piece we’ve seen before – as Kate also wore it more recently over the Jubilee weekend. She completed the look with Finlay sunglasses and pearl earrings.
