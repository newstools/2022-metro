A explosion was narrowly avoided when a campervan burst into flames in a petrol station. The American-style motorhome caught fire as the driver filled the tank at a Morrison’s garage in Dorset. Within minutes the fire had completely gutted the vehicle and spread to the forecourt roof and pumping equipment. Horrified witnesses fled fearing there could be blast while a thick column of smoke could be seen from miles around. The occupants managed to escape unharmed and firefighters got the situation under control before it was able to spread further. Barbara Davis, 66, who saw the fire, said: ‘We just came out and my husband said “what’s that smoke”? I looked across, and then we realised there were flames as well. ‘We thought we better get out quick and managed to get in the car and drive out. ‘As we drove past we could feel the heat from the fire and staff were all out in the road trying to direct the traffic away to stop anybody else coming in and to make sure that nobody was getting too close to it. ‘It was very intense and very hot. We didn’t have any windows open but we could feel the heat in the car and it was really strong. ‘As we came out into the road we could still feel the heat and could see the smoke was getting quite thick. ‘It must have gone up really quick though because we were only in the shop around five, maybe 10 minutes. ‘By the time it took us to drive past the garage the flames started to get really big. It was quite a shock.’ Another witness, James Tourgout, added: ‘It could have been pretty catastrophic if the whole station blew up. The firefighters must have done well in a very pressurised situation’. District fire commander for Weymouth and Portland, James Plumley said it took around 20 firefighters to stop the blaze getting out of hand, praising them for their ‘excellent job’.
