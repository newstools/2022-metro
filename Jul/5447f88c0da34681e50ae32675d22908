A Russian ice hockey player who had signed for an American team has reportedly fallen ill after being press-ganged into military service. Ivan Fedotov, a silver Olympic medal holder, was detained outside a rink in St Petersburg, according to Russia-based media. Authorities have accused him of evading service at a time when the Kremlin is desperate for more recruits. His lawyer told a Russian state news agency that he has been taken to a military hospital after falling ill. The 25-year-old goaltender signed a one-year entry-level contract with the Philadelphia Flyers in May. But the Fontanka.ru news website said on Friday he had been detained at the request of the military prosecutor’s office and was taken to an enlistment office. His lawyer, Alexei Ponomaryev, told state news agency RIA on Saturday that Fedotov was detained on Friday and then fell ill. He said: ‘As I understand it, due to stress, he had gastritis. Ivan feels bad. ‘He says that he is not being provided with full medical assistance.’ Ponomaryev denied accusations that his client had evaded military service. Russian men under 27 are expected to complete one year of national service but there are exemptions in place. Officially, conscripts are not sent to fight in Ukraine but multiple reports have emerged of young soldiers on national service and reservists being deployed. Fedotov, who was selected by the Philadelphia Flyers in the 2015 Entry Draft, led CSKA Moscow of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) to the Gagarin Cup, the league’s championship title, last season. A spokesman for CSKA Moscow told Reuters on Friday it was awaiting official information from relevant bodies. The spokesperson said: ‘At the moment Ivan Fedotov is not bound by contractual obligations with our club.’ The NHL has severed business ties with Russia but has not banned the more than 50 players on its teams.
