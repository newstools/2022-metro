Manchester United are close to confirming their first signing of the summer after agreeing personal terms with Feyenoord full-back Tyrell Malacia. A fee was agreed between the clubs earlier this week, with United paying an initial €15m (£12.94m) which could rise to €17m (£14.66m). The Athletic now report that personal terms have been agreed between the Red Devils and the Netherlands international, with the 22-year-old to sign a four-year contract with an option for another 12 months. No contract has been signed as yet, but a medical could be completed this weekend and Malacia become Erik ten Hag’s first signing as Manchester United boss. The left-back has been at Feyenoord for his entire career, making his debut in a Champions League fixture back in December 2017. He picked up his first Netherlands cap last year and has played five times for his country, hoping to be involved at the World Cup at the end of this year. The Athletic also report that a deal for versatile Ajax star Lisandro Martinez is also close, with Manchester United ahead of Arsenal in the race for his signature. Talks are said to be at an advanced stage, with Martinez preferring to link up with former boss Ten Hag at Old Trafford. The Argentina international can play at centre-back, left-back and in the middle of midfield and has picked up seven caps for his country. Top target Frenkie de Jong is still being pursued and United are favourites to sign the Dutch midfielder this summer, while Christian Eriksen is also wanted by Ten Hag.
