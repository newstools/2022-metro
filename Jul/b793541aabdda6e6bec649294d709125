Cristiano Ronaldo has been offered to Paris Saint-Germain in recent days – but the French champions have no plans to sign the veteran striker this summer. Ronaldo has informed Manchester United he wishes to leave and has not travelled with the squad for their tour of Asia and Australia. His agent Jorge Mendes is attempting to find the 37-year-old a new club but according to Le Parisien, PSG have passed up the chance to do a deal. Chelsea have also been offered the former Real Madrid star but Blues boss Thomas Tuchel is not thought to be keen on bringing Ronaldo to Stamford Bridge. Ronaldo did not report for pre-season training with United last week due to ‘family reasons’. United’s position has remained that Ronaldo is not for sale, with Erik ten Hag underlining his importance to his plans at a press conference on Monday. He’s not with us, it is due to personal issues,’ Ten Hag said. Asked if Ronaldo would be sold this summer, Ten Hag replied: ‘No, we are planning with Ronaldo for this season, so that’s it and I am looking forward to working with him. ‘I don’t know, he hasn’t told me this so I have read but what I say Cristiano is not for sale, he’s in our plans and we want to get success together.’ Ten Hag also confirmed that he has not spoken to Ronaldo since it emerged that he is pushing to leave Old Trafford. ‘I spoke with him before this issue came up I had a conversation with him, a real good talk.’ Ronaldo has also been linked with a move to Bayern Munich with Robert Lewandowksi determined to join Barcelona this summer. But the German champions reportedly have no interest in signing the Portuguese.
