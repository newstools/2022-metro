Getting on the property ladder is a far away dream for a lot of people in the UK. But if you can’t buy a home in your own country, you could always buy a village in France. And that is exactly what Paul Mappley and his partner Yip Ward did with their savings. Appearing on Channel 4’s Help! We Bought a Village, the pair said they have never owned so much as a studio flat in the UK. But they are now planning to create a luxury holiday destination in the historic hamlet of La Busliere, in Normandy, after buying it for €14,000 (about £11,775). It is made up of six cottages, two barns and a paddock, plus a two-storey workshop, cider press and communal bread oven. The two landscape gardeners were living in a caravan in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, when a friend offered them the chance to buy it in 2019. While the cottage has no electricity and needs a fair bit of work, Yip urged anyone thinking of doing the same to ‘just go for it’. He told The Sun: ‘In the area we were living before 2021 it was about £300,000 to buy a tiny place to live, and that was just never on the table for us. ‘We had always rented and we were living in a – really lovely – static mobile caravan belonging to our friend. ‘But when they looked to sell it, we began to worry. ‘So it was incredibly exciting when we heard from a friend about Le Busliere. We began to think: ‘This could really happen for us.”’ Paul admitted it has been ‘stressful at times’, adding they are short of money, but are ‘so grateful to be here’. ‘It was like a squat when we moved in, but we’re quite comfortable now,’ he said.
