Team England’s gymnasts won gold in the men’s team final at the Commonwealth Games, thanks in part to Joe Fraser who battled through a broken foot to compete in Birmingham. The 23-year-old had also suffered a ruptured appendix in the build-up to the Games and he was forced to pull out of the vault and floor apparatus as a result, which meant he could not compete for the all-around title. He did power through other disciplines, though, topping the scores in pommel horse and horizontal bars, while also impressing in the rings and parallel bars. Fraser’s performances were remarkable, as were those of Jake Jarman, Courtney Tulloch, Giarnni Regini-Moran and James Hall who all claimed gold. ‘I’ve been trying to defy the odds and get back fit – I’m just so proud of myself,’ Fraser said. ‘I’m hardcore. Numerous times I thought maybe this isn’t meant to be but the thought of performing in front of a home crowd, literally down the road from where I live, just made me want to push myself and achieve great things. He added: ‘I’ve faced so much adversity. Before the high bar, my coach said “I believe in you”, and that was exactly what I needed. ‘Sticking the dismount just made everything become real. Even with the injuries I’ve been managing, to walk away with that landing, I was just so proud of myself.’ MORE : Alex Yee wins England’s first gold of 2022 Commonwealth Games in ‘fairytale’ men’s triathlon MORE : Tom Daley’s powerful nod to gay rights at Commonwealth Games opening ceremony For more stories like this, check our sport page.
