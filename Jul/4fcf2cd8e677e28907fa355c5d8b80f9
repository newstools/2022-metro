Luca Bish’s family have said they do not condone the Love Island star’s recent behaviour on the dating series. The 23-year-old fishmonger has received criticism after he blew up at partner Gemma Owen and accused her of ‘flirting’ with fellow islander Billy Brown, after watching clips during the bombshell Movie Night episodes. After seeing how Billy tried his luck with Michael Owen’s daughter, Luca was unimpressed with the pair’s behaviour and appeared to place much of the blame on Gemma. His family have now addressed Luca’s expletive-filled ranting and said in a statement: ‘I want to apologise on behalf of Luca for his insensitive reaction on last night’s episode. I know that when he watches it back, he will be embarrassed and deeply apologetic. ‘We as his family don’t condone his behaviour last night, but we do understand he is in an intense environment where his emotions are heightened. Last night was not reflective of the boy we all love at home.’ They continued: ‘Please be aware death threats and nasty comments totally overstep the mark and something we as a family should not have to endure, for this reason we have turned off the comments and messages. ‘For all those who have sent messages checking in on us, we would like to thank you very much and we see you.’ During last night’s episode, viewers watched uncomfortably as Luca became increasingly convinced that Gemma was ‘entertaining’ Billy in the clips. He fumed to the boys: ‘I don’t even want to talk to her tonight. Made me look like an absolute f*****g w****r  I ain’t going f*****g near that bird.’ Luca then warned: ‘Bring a f*****g bird in now and watch me flirt. If she wants to play it down to me I will f*****g explode.’ After Sunday night’s shocking episode, Luca’s family pleaded with trolls to stop sending abuse in light of his behaviour. They wrote: ‘Please, please, please stop messaging abuse. Luca can’t even see it… the people that love him most can. ‘I’ve just been sick from crying so much at the death threats (an hour on from that last story). How can people be so inhumane.’ Alongside screen grabs of messages from trolls, the person behind the account added: ‘The hardest night of my entire life. This is happening every second. ‘Just so beyond grateful Luca isn’t here to read these. Heartbroken.’ Love Island airs nightly at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
