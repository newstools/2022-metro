A woman has been killed and three others taken to hospital after a caravan caught fire at a rural campsite. The early-hours blaze took place at Happy Days Retro Vacations, a small campsite in Saxmundham, Suffolk, home to seven airstream caravans. According to Suffolk Police, the fire did not spread beyond the caravan. Suffolk Fire and Rescue confirmed they were called to the site of the blaze at 4.40am this morning, at Wardspring Farm in Leiston Road. The website is now offline and was listed as being closed on some booking sites on Sunday. However, other holiday booking sites say a caravan at the campsite costs around £66 per night to rent. It is not yet known what caused the fire. The incident is being investigated jointly by Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service, East Suffolk Council and Suffolk Police. It comes as temperatures across the UK hit 40°C last week, the hottest temperature ever recorded in the country. Entire rows of houses in Wennington, close to the Dartford crossing, went up in smoke because of the weather. Experts say weather patterns like this will increasingly become the norm as a result of climate change. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
