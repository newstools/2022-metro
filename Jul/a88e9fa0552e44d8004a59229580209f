An adorable three-year-old pooch loves nothing more than being on (or in) the water. Coral the golden retriever currently lives on a boat with her owners Hannah Pattern and John Garza. The couple, from Florida, left their old lives behind and now live on the ocean with their four-legged-friend. Coral had initially planned to become a service dog – but sadly failed the training due to an eye condition. Now, instead of working full-time, she’s enjoying life at sea and spends her days swimming and relaxing in the sunshine. Hannah, the founder of a sustainable swimwear brand, describes her canine as ‘sweet and loving but with attitude and spunk.’ The 24-year-old adds: ‘She puts up with a lot being on the boat, and I think she loves the water more than John and myself. ‘I adopted her at six weeks old and the first time I tried to get her to swim she hated it, but she loved the boat. So I knew it was only a matter of time for her to realise how fun it is.’ The couple love their new life on the water and Coral is pretty thrilled with it too – she even dives in with her owners. ‘People think it’s absolutely nuts that she dives,’ Hannah adds, ‘She honestly just picked it up – that’s the best part. ‘I think she’s watched us dive so much so she’s like I don’t want to be left out.’ Do you have a story to share?
