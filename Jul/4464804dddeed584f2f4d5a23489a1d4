 TalkTV’s Kate McCann has returned to the network feeling a ‘little embarrassed’ after fainting live on air during the Tory leadership debate. The journalist had been hosting Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak’s latest head-to-head when she collapsed halfway through the event while the Foreign Secretary was speaking. The channel temporarily stopped broadcasting shortly afterward, with the holding sign telling viewers the network was off air reportedly raking in audiences. Kate returned to TalkTV on Wednesday night and addressed the unexpected moment. Asked how she was holding up, she admitted: ‘A little embarrassed, a little bit bruised, glad to be back and totally fine. ‘Not necessarily what any of us expected to happen last night, I don’t think. ‘It was one of those moments no one could really prepare for. I think both Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak were pretty shocked by it.’ Halfway through Tuesday’s debate, a loud crash was heard in the studio and Ms Truss looked visibly worried and could be heard saying ‘oh my God’ as she looked towards the ground and then walked away from her podium. News UK later confirmed that there had been a ‘medical incident’. During this time, the network aired a holding card that read: ‘We’re sorry for the disruption to this programme. We’re working hard to fix the issue and will return to normal programming soon.’ Before the disruption, Kate had been moderating the debate on her own after her scheduled co-host, Sun political editor Harry Cole, tested positive for Covid.
