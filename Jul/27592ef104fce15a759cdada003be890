Things may be a bit hot out there and the water may look enticing, but we’re still not sure jumping into the Thames is a good idea. But that’s what a group of lads have been up to from Tower Bridge in a bid to keep cool. Footage shows them jumping simultaneously at least 30ft from the landmark into the murky waters below. A crowd gathers as a fourth jumper waits for his mates to emerge from the river before leaping. ‘Flipping off Tower Bridge with the boys,’ amateur photographer Adam Szaniawski captioned the clip on Instagram. The RNLI has previously warned against such ‘extremely dangerous’ pranks. A teenager nearly drowned leaping off Tower Bridge in 2015. The river’s fast currents also make swimming in the water treacherous. Mr Szaniawski’s followers seemed to enjoy the stunt, calling it ‘sick’ – which means good – in the comments. One warned ‘I hope you fellas didn’t swallow any microplastics’, while another said there are probably ‘like 50 diseases in that river alone’. Mr Szaniawski’s Instagram page and YouTube channel features vlogs from visits to Chernobyl in Ukraine and images of him scaling high-rise buildings in London. Another video from two years ago shows him and his friends jumping into the Thames from different bridges during lockdown. Mr Szaniawski said at the time: ‘We got bored of sitting at home, so as lockdown measures eased down, we decided to go down to London and have some fun.’ Temperatures in the capital are continuing to rise this week, but Londoners are advised to look for other methods of cooling off – such as a cold shower.
