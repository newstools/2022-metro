After Tasha Ghouri had the nation in stitches with her cup song during the Love Island talent show, her family has released a clip of her ‘real talent’. The 23-year-old is actually a professional dancer – and a really good one at that. So after she flipped cups and sang the cup song, everyone watching at home wondered why we didn’t get to see her bust some moves instead. Well, thankfully her loved ones have shared a video dancing to Doja Cat and, seriously, she was stitched up on the talent show. Alongside the video, her fam wrote: ‘Tonight was JOKES but we thought it would only be fair to share her real talent.’ And they weren’t wrong. However, Tasha’s cup song wasn’t even the strangest moment of the night. That accolade fell on Indiyah Polack who took ear-splitting recorder playing to an entirely new level. She had the islanders cracking up as she squawked through Twinkle Twinle Little Star, with Tasha having to cover Andrew Le Page’s mouth when he couldn’t stop laughing. Even the Love Island subtitles had a pop at Indiyah. One fan shared a photo of the subtitles that read: ‘She plays “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” badly.’ BURN. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
