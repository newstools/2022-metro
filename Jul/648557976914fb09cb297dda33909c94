While Paige Thorne anxiously agonises over Jacques O’Neill during her stay at Casa Amor, bombshell Samuel Agbiji has left her shaken with some home truths about the rugby player. Jacques horrified viewers this week when he asked ‘Paige, who’ when reacting to the new villa bombshells. While the Casa Amor hunks have been watching Love Island, Samuel told Paige exactly how Jacques has been coming across to viewers, and he wasn’t kind to put it lightly. ‘He’s quite a cheeky chappy guy,’ Samuel began. ‘What I also believe is quite clear is you [Paige] like him more than he likes you, just an observation. ‘It’s not just that alone, but he’s aware of it which is why in a sense, he has had power in different ways in the relationship that you may not have realised.’ He continues: ‘He’s disrespected you in some arguments that he shouldn’t have done. ‘Now, if they put a girl in there that is confident, very flirtatious, that is as good looking as you and she applies pressure onto him, and goes forward on to him his head could potentially turn…. ‘He’s just one of those that in a flirty situation, he’s definitely flirting back.’ Last night’s Love Island spoiler revealed Paige breaking down in tears, and now it’s clear to see why. And she’s right to be scared as Jacques firmly told Dami Hope he needs to crack on. ‘I need to put myself out there,’ he said. ‘How do I know if what I’ve got with Paige is so good if I don’t even give it another chance with someone else? ‘For me to do that, I need to crack on. I can’t be sat around here and sulking for someone else.’ The boys really love that logic, don’t they? Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
