A pair of ‘real-life superheroes’ casually saved the lives of three children at the start of a standard work day. Binmen Nick Gardner and Mark Hewitt were on their regular collection run on a street in Ilford, Essex, on Monday, when they noticed a young boy with his head sticking out of the window while smoke billowed from flames engulfing his home. With no thoughts for their own safety, Nick shouted up to the youngster to stay where he was able to get fresh air as he ran to fetch a ladder, while Mark bravely kicked down the front door so two other children could escape. A young adult was also able to get out through the back door. The workers called 999 and firefighters rushed to put the fire out while Nick and Mark went back to finish their round. Nick told EssexLive: ‘We’re just pleased that no one came to any harm. We then got on with our shift as normal. ‘It wasn’t until later that evening that I realised what had happened. These things can take time to sink in.’ Mark added: ‘It all happened so quickly. I think the two young boys who managed to escape through the front door showed great bravery in my eyes. ‘If we hadn’t been driving down Mortlake Road that morning, I shudder to think what might have happened.’ It is not yet clear how the fire started but an investigation is under way. Redbridge Council’s chief executive Claire Symonds, said: ‘Nick and Mark showed incredible bravery and resolve. ‘Their quick thinking and decisive action saved lives, and we are all so grateful that they happened to be in the right place at the right time to make a real difference. ‘What was also amazing was that after this drama, they then went on to finish their round!’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
