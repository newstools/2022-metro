Residents at a block of flats feared it could become ‘another Grenfell’ when it went up in flames on Tuesday morning. Firefighters raced to the 16-storey Abbey View block in Garsmouth Way, Watford, at around 5am after a blaze broke out. An outside bin is thought to have been set alight before the flames spread to the nearby building. Andrew Carberry, who ran from his flat screaming ‘fire’ to try and alert his neighbours, said: ‘My only hope was to save lives. I didn’t want another Grenfell.’ He told the Evening Standard he heard ‘what sounded like an explosion’ from his front room before peering out the window and hearing the fire. Mr Carberry said he quickly got dressed and headed outside. ‘I shouted fire 20 times to alert the people in the tower block,’ he told the newspaper. ‘One family got out saying they heard my shouts, which is good.’ He said the worst damage was confined to the lower floors, where the fire appeared to have started. Herts Fire and Rescue said the first four floors were evacuated before eight engines managed to put the fire out. The ambulance service confirmed one person was treated at the scene for smoke inhalation and emergency crews continue to assess residents that have been evacuated. Hertfordshire Police said on Tuesday morning: ‘We are currently assisting the fire service at the scene of a fire in Garsmouth Way, Watford. ‘Road closures are in place at the junction with Meridan Way & in The Gossamers at the junction with York Way. People are asked to please avoid the area at this time.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
