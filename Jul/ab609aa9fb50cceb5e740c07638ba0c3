A man who throttled a woman in a ‘nasty’ attack at her home has become one of the first in the country to be convicted of non-fatal strangulation. Michael Strange, 33, from Runcorn, was jailed for a year at North Cheshire Magistrates’ Court last Monday, July 18. He earlier pleaded guilty to offences of intentional strangulation and ABH in relation to the same victim, as well as the criminal damage of her front door – all committed the previous day. The court heard the ‘nasty assault’ was an ‘unprovoked attack of a serious nature’. Non-fatal strangulation is a new offence which came into force just weeks ago on June 7. It carries a maximum sentence of 12 months imprisonment in the magistrates’ court and five years’ imprisonment in the crown court. The offence was created as part of landmark domestic abuse legislation and applies to perpetrators who strangle or intentionally affect their victim’s ability to breathe in an attempt to control or intimidate them. It follows concerns that abusers were avoiding punishment as non-fatal strangulation does not always leave visible signs of injury. Strange was also banned from contacting or approaching his victim or entering a named street. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
