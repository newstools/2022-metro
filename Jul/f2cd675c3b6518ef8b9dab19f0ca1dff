Thomas Tuchel has reservations about Cristiano Ronaldo joining Chelsea, according to reports. Ronaldo is pushing to leave Manchester United this summer and is keen to join a club who can challenge in the Champions League next season. Chelsea’s new co-owner Todd Boehly has held talks with Ronaldo’s agent about a possible deal for the 37-year-old, but Tuchel would also need to be on board with the move. According to MailOnline, Tuchel is ‘reluctant’ to bring Ronaldo to Chelsea as he believes the United forward could upset the balance of his side. The report claims that Tuchel wants Chelsea to play with a ‘fluid front three’ in attack, with incoming signing Raheem Sterling a key part of his plan. It’s also claimed that Tuchel is ‘mindful’ of how Ronaldo’s arrival at Old Trafford last year had an impact on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s attacking system at United. Ronaldo, meanwhile, has not joined up with United’s squad for their pre-season tour of the Far East and Australia. The Portugal international did not report for training on Monday due to ‘family reasons’. Chelsea have agreed a £47.5 million fee with Manchester City for Sterling and the England international is on the bring of becoming the club’s first summer signing. Chelsea are also waiting on a decision from Raphinha, whose preference is to join Barcelona but the Spanish club have been unable to reach an agreement with Leeds United. A £55m deal has been agreed between Chelsea and Leeds, and Raphinha is open to moving to Tuchel’s side if Barcelona are unable to finance their move. Chelsea are also in talks with City to sign Nathan Ake and have targeted Matthijs de Ligt, but the Juventus centre-back prefers to join Bayer Munich. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
