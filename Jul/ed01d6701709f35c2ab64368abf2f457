A 100lb sailfish stabbed a 70-year-old woman after it leapt out of the water. Katherine Perkins was hit in the groin by its pointed bill while she was standing in a boat about two miles offshore from Stuart, Florida. Her companions Louis Toth and Dominic Bellezza were trying to reel it in on a fishing line when it suddenly jumped up onto their boat. They applied pressure to Ms Perkins’ wound and rushed her to Stuart for medical treatment. The pensioner, from Arnold, Maryland, told police it happened so fast she did not have time to react. Sailfish are among the fastest fish species in the ocean, and are one of the most wanted in the sport fishing world. Similar to swordfish, they are recognisable by their extended, pointed bills.
