Congratulations are in order for Alexandra Burke, with the singer announcing the arrival of her first baby. Alexandra, 33, and boyfriend Darren Randolph welcomed the new addition to the family and while we don’t have any more details, such as a name, yet, we’ve been given a glimpse of the little one’s feet. In a photo, X Factor star Alexandra shared a shot of the baby’s adorably little toes, with well-wishers crowding the comments section with messages of congrats. Sharing the sweet news on Instagram this morning, the singer wrote: ‘Welcome to the world our little grape 🥰 ‘We already love you more than words can say 🍇🌎🤍’ Alexandra and Darren, 35, announced Alexandra’s pregnancy in February after less than a year of dating. Alexandra announced their baby news in a short video which showed her and West Ham footballer Darren walking their multiple dogs in a park, holding hands and taking selfies together. For the grand reveal, Darren bent down and kissed her baby bump before the pair shared a sweet kiss. It’s believed Alex and Darren have been dating since at least May 2021, as the singer appeared to confirm their romance by sharing a cute selfie of them together. They were heading for dinner at Japanese restaurant Roka, which Darren dubbed: ‘London date night.’ Confirming their relationship, a source told The Sun at the time: ‘It’s early days and Alexandra has deliberately taken things incredibly slowly. ‘They’ve had a series of dates but not been able to meet up as much as they would have wanted due to her hectic work schedule and the Covid restrictions. ‘Alexandra was extremely reluctant to date another footballer but Darren is the sweetest, most down-to-earth guy — and incredibly charming. He wore her down.’ The couple went public with their romance at the Dune premiere in London last October, walking the red carpet together and looking loved-up. Alexandra recently opened up about her pregnancy, revealing how the journey had changed how she felt about her body, writing for the first three or four months of pregnancy she really struggled accepting all the changes to her body. She wrote: ‘I’ll be honest and admit I’ve been through quite a few ups and down privately, BUT I now find myself in a totally different head space and I finally feel good about my body. ‘I’ve always had a passion for working out mainly because it made me feel good mentally. I’m not going to lie though, of course there was the physical impact too! ‘However when I now look back to life before I was pregnant I remember never being happy and always thinking I was never ‘good enough’ shall we say […] I was never completely happy with what I saw in the mirror.’ Alexandra, who will join the touring production of Joseph And The Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat on September 12, added she was ‘learning to show my body more gratitude, more appreciation’ and went on: ‘Having the blessing of growing a little human these last 9 months has honestly been one of the best feelings in the world. Feeling comfortable in my own skin I’ve decided to try and never be unkind to myself or my body moving forward. ‘I didn’t realise how much I used to worry about stupid things before this whole amazing experience, for what I now realise was for NO REASON! 😌 ‘So I guess what I’m trying to say, pregnancy aside, is that we must try to love our bodies more rather than looking for negatives or comparing ourselves to others. We put our bodies through way too much scrutiny. ‘It won’t always be easy, but I’m determined to continue this mindset of self love because I truly believe we can not be happy unless we truly love the wonderful bodies we are in!’
