A woman who had rented a GoCar wondered what the funny smell was until she pulled open the boot to find a dead body. The corpse, found on Monday, is believed to belong to the man who had rented the vehicle before her. The 40-year-old is believed to have been reported missing nearly two weeks before in Ireland. A source said the woman, in her 20s, was ‘stunned’ after making the discovery in the quiet village of Mullinavat. ‘She picked up the car at one of the GoCar depot spots and had just a short drive out to where she was heading, the village of Mullinavat, I’d say around five miles’, they told the Irish Mirror. ‘While she was driving she noticed a funny smell, she didn’t know what it was, thought it smelled like gas and thought it might be coming from the car engine when she started the car. ‘But it didn’t go away and so she stopped the car when she got to Millivant and that’s where she made the shocking discovery, there was the body of a dead man in the boot.’ GoCar is car sharing service that allows people to rent cars for as little as an hour, unlocking them with their phone. Europcar, the parent company of GoCar, was questioned on how often the vehicles are cleaned. They replied: ‘GoCar is assisting An Garda Síochána with its investigation into the tragic incident that occurred earlier this week in Kilkenny. ‘We express our deepest condolences to the loved ones of the deceased at this time.’ The Garda confirmed to Metro.co.uk they have stopped their appeal for a missing person.
