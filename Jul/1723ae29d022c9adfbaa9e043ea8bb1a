Cars driving on this stretch of melting road in Stockport sound like they’re ‘driving through water’. Extreme temperatures turned Broadstone Road into sticky, black goo yesterday as the heat liquified the asphalt. One onlooker described how his feet ‘got stuck’ when walking across the surface, while tarmac was lodged in the treads of his tyres. He added: ‘It sounded like it had just rained and the cars were drivingthrough the puddles.’ Temperatures hit a record 34.3C° in Greater Manchester yesterday – beating the previous record of 33.9C° from July 25, 2019. They then stretched to 38C° today while the whole country’s all-time highest temperature was exceeded. Roads in the sun can get as hot as 50C°, and at these temperatures, they begin to become soft, according to the Road Surface Treatments Association. This is because the road surface absorbs heat and this builds up during the day. When temperatures soar some councils grit the roads to prevent themfrom melting. Speaking last week Howard Robinson, chief executive of the Road Surface Treatments Association, said: ‘Drivers may be bemused to see the gritters out in the summer when they are usually spreading grit and salt during the winter. ‘However, this is effective standard practice for keeping a roadsurface safe during extreme prolonged hot temperatures. ‘Asphalt is a bit like chocolate – it melts and softens when it’s hot and goes hard and brittle when it’s cold – it doesn’t maintain the same strength all year round.’ Stockport Council has been contacted for a comment.
