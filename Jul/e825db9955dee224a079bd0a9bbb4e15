Adam Collard immediately shakes up the Love Island villa tonight as a first look shows the returning islander make a huge impression on Paige Thorne. The paramedic has been left heartbroken by Jacques O’Neill, who tonight will also try his best to win Paige over with an essay on his phone which is about the length of War & Peace. But it might be too late for the rugby ace after Adam pulls Paige for a chat and the Love Island girls cannot believe their eyes. ‘Jacques it out the window!’ Ekin-su Cülcüloğlu gasps to Gemma Owen and Tasha Gouri. And they’re not wrong, as Paige gets flustered chatting about the unexpected bombshell in the Beach Hut. ‘I feel like he has a lot of potential, he is ticking a good few of my boxes,’ she says. However, Paige might have competition as Adam also gets his sights on Ekin-su and Danica Taylor. Love Island viewers have been torn by the arrival of Adam, but no one was more stunned than his ex Zara McDermott, who he was coupled up with during the 2018 series. Her boyfriend, Made In Chelsea’s Sam Thompson, shared a video of the moment Zara saw her ex returning to the villa last night and her reaction was priceless. Adam, who’s been dubbed the ‘ultimate bombshell’, said of his return: ‘I’m going to ruffle a few feathers when I go in.’ Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
