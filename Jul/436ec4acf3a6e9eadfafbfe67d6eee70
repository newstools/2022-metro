A woman says her husband was left looking ‘like a pirate’ after their clothes arrived at an airport ripped to shreds. Karen Nowland and her husband, both from Glasgow, flew from Manchester to Sri Lanka with Etihad Airways last week for their holiday. When they landed in Colombo, they discovered all their clothes had been torn to pieces and stuffed inside plastic bags. After demanding an apology from Etihad Airways, Karen managed to find a funny side to the problem which she shared in a series of tweets. She initially wrote ‘What on earth happened?’ before posting: ‘Hey @etihad Look what happened to my husband’s bag somewhere between Manchester and Colombo!! Why are you ignoring our emails to @EtihadHelp? ‘My husband looks like a pirate. Not the tropical holiday look he had in mind.’ Karen added: ‘Have you ever seen baggage end up like this? Flight from Manchester. It arrived on carousel in Colombo in a plastic bag. ‘What on earth happened? @etihad aren’t replying to our emails. Not sure the backless look suits my husband.’ In a statement, Etihad Airways said: ‘We were unaware of this case, but reached out directly to the guest to provide full support as soon as we were alerted. ‘Unfortunately the guest was provided incorrect contact information to raise a baggage claim, but now we are aware the matter will be quickly resolved. ‘We are conducting a full investigation into the cause of the damage to the guest’s baggage, as well as our partner’s guest communication process to ensure this doesn’t happen again. ‘We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience our guest experienced.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
