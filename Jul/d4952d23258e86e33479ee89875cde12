Sir Lewis Hamilton appears to have removed his nose stud ahead of the first practice session of the British Grand Prix on Friday. The seven-time Formula 1 world champion has been involved in a long-running dispute with the FIA over wearing jewellery while racing, with the governing body threatening to ban drivers if they did not remove earrings and studs in compliance with the regulations. Hamilton arrived at the Silverstone paddock on Friday morning with the nose stud still present but by the time he got into his Mercedes for FP1 at 13:00, it had been removed. An FIA spokesman said: ‘The stud has gone.’ The dispute has been going on since April, when FIA president Mohammed ben Sulayem and F1 race director Niels Wittich announced they would be more heavily enforcing the jewellery ban that has been in place since 2004. Hamilton though has claimed on numerous occasions that he would not and could not accept the ban, reasoning that his jewellery had never caused safety problems before and that some items such as an earring could not physically be removed. ‘These ones on my right ear, they’re literally welded in. I [would] have to get them chopped off or something like that, so they will be staying,’ the 37-year-old said. Discussing the situation during a press conference on Thursday, Hamilton said: ‘It’s worrying – we’ve got bigger fish to fry. We’ve really got to start focusing on more important areas. ‘I will be racing this weekend. I’m working with the FIA. The matter is not massively important, I’ll work with Mohammed and his team to take the next steps forward.’ MORE : Lewis Hamilton thanks fans for their support in Nelson Piquet controversy MORE : Sebastian Vettel, Max Verstappen and more F1 drivers rally to support Lewis Hamilton amid racial abuse For more stories like this, check our sport page.
