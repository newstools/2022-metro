Lauren Goodger has posted Celine Dion’s poignant song A Mother’s Prayer on Instagram following the death of her baby daughter. At the weekend, the former The Only Way Is Essex star revealed that her second baby, a girl named Lorena, died after her birth. The 34-year-old – who also shares daughter Larose with boyfriend Charles Drury – shared that she didn’t suffer any pregnancy or labour complications, writing that ‘words can’t describe as a mother losing your baby that I carried for all these months perfectly and gave birth too for my angel to be taken from me’. In a new post on her Instagram Story, Lauren played the lyrics to A Mother’s Prayer, originally titled The Prayer by Celine and Andrea Boccelli. The lyrics from the re-recorded solo version by Celine, which played on Lauren’s Story, went: ‘Lead her to a place. Guide her with your grace. To a place where she’ll be safe.’ When Lauren announced that she and Charles, 24, had suffered the loss of Lorena, she wrote that her daughter was ‘fine and healthy’. Sharing a black-and-white photo of her late baby girl’s hand, she said: ‘I am broken 💔 I am back home from hospital Me & Charlie spent as much time with our baby girl Lorena and I haven’t said my goodbye yet. ‘Larose she is my rock that’s getting me through this or I wouldn’t survive… I will never ever get over this but I will learn how to live everyday with Lorena in my heart she will be with me always and I will be with her again one day … My 👼 Lorena I love you so much.’ Numerous stars shared messages of condolence for Lauren under her post, including Towie star Danielle Armstong, who wrote: ‘Oh darling heartbroken 💔 for you sending you strength and love and hope your get the respect and privacy you need to grieve 🤍 xxxx.’ ‘I’m so so sorry Lauren , sending you so much love & strength right now,’ said reality star Georgia Kousoulou, while Love Island’s Maura Higgins added: ‘So so sorry 🥺 sending all the love and strength ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.’ Former Celebrity Big Brother contestant Gemma Collins wrote: ‘Lauren I am devastated for you sending so much love right now,’ as TV personality Ferne McCann commented: ‘Lauren.
