Feyenoord defender Tyrell Malacia is set to become Erik ten Hag’s first signing at Manchester United, with the Dutchman expected to have a medical in the north-west today. United hijacked Lyon’s deal for the defender last week and Malacia informed the Ligue 1 giants that he wanted to move to Old Trafford. However, a dispute between Malacia and his representatives threatened to hold up a move to the Theatre of Dreams but the issue has now been ironed out. The Red Devils have struggled for signings so far this summer, with John Murtough dedicating most of his time to negotiating a deal for Frenkie de Jong. But Malacia is set to jet to England today to complete his medical with the club, before signing in a deal worth around £13m. The defender is set to rival Luke Shaw for a starting berth at left-back, while Alex Telles is expected to depart. Ten Hag is also willing to listen to offers for Eric Bailly, Axel Tuanzebe and Phil Jones. Malacia’s move could be announced on Monday, with United then hoping to complete deals for De Jong and Christian Eriksen. United will then attempt to convince Cristiano Ronaldo to stay at Old Trafford after the 37-year-old asked to leave the club.
