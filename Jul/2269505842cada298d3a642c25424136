Beauty trends are changing – and modern nail art is the new upgrade to a classic French manicure. Opting for subtle touches of colour and art can work still work for a wedding and add some interest to a beauty look. There are more options than you think, as Juanita Huber-Millet, the founder of nail destination Townhouse, tells us. Trends are changing, as she says: ‘For on trend brides, we are seeing a lot opting for florals – delicate leaves or florals for sophisticated wedding nail art. ‘These are usually done with a gorgeous natural base with the design in a wedding white to perfectly complement their stunning gown. ‘Nailing the perfect bridal look is about having every element in sync, from shoes to hair and you want to avoid any one item shouting too loudly. This is always kept in mind with nail art designs. ‘These trends instead bring an elegant accent to the manicure and act as a subtle accessory to the bride’s overall attire. ‘It allows the bride to showcase a bit of their style and personality in a super wearable and timeless way.’ At Townhouse’s new Kensington branch, the ‘bridal Frenchie’ is in high demand. Juanita adds: ‘The traditional crisp white is popular for short nails and softer milkier tones for longer nails. ‘Gold Frenchies and thinner lines are also very popular with brides. It’s less traditional and subtly bolder but it’s still a very chic look.’ Metallic tips An update on the French manicure – going for gold. Pick a skin tonal base and add gentle detailing in a lighter shade for delicate contrast. Sweet and feminine nail art. Pick one nail to have an enhancement, such as the word ‘love’.
