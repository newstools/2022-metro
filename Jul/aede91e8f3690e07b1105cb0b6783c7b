Just imagine what you could do with £186 million. You’ll have to overcome odds of 139,838,160 to one to win the biggest ever EuroMillions jackpot, but it’s surely worth a punt. If a single Brit scoops the top prize tomorrow, the UK would overtake France with the most lottery wins. Both countries are tied on 117 jackpots, with Spain third luckiest on 113, followed by Portugal on 80 and Switzerland at 24. The UK’s biggest ever winners, Joe and Jess Thwaite, who took home £184 million in May, could also be trumped if there is a lucky single winner. With a jackpot this size, a single winner could comfortably live off the massive sum for the rest of their lives. Camelot’s Andy Carter said: ‘I knew my team had been busy with big winners but I didn’t realise what an amazing run of EuroMillions luck the UK has had. ‘It’s great to travel to every corner of the country making new millionaires and we know that EuroMillions makes the biggest winners. ‘These dream-come-true jackpots not only transform the lives of the winners but also enable them to support the friends, family and communities around them. ‘I hope we are again celebrating reaching the top of the league table after Tuesday’s draw and we look forward to supporting any big UK winners we create.’ There have already been some very lucky winners this year. One winner scooped £109 million in February and a lucky player banked £54 million in June. Winning £186 million would make someone richer than singer and ex-One Direction member, Harry Styles, who’s worth £100 million according to The Sunday Times Rich List 2022. If the massive sum of money was laid out in £50 notes it would cover 580km. This would stretch from London to Edinburgh with enough to climb up Arthur’s Seat and back down again. To be in with a chance of winning, players need to get their tickets before 7.30pm tomorrow. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
