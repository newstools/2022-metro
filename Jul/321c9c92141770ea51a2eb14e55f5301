The Queen has sent a message of congratulations to England’s victorious women’s football team after they made history tonight. She said they have not only won the Euro 2022 championship but should be proud of their impact on the sport itself – with this tournament bringing attention to the women’s game that hasn’t been matched. In a statement circulated by Buckingham Palace, Elizabeth II said: ‘My warmest congratulations, and those of my family, go to you all on winning the European Women’s Football Championships. ‘It is a significant achievement for the entire team, including your support staff. ‘The Championships and your performance in them have rightly won praise. ‘However, your success goes far beyond the trophy you have so deservedly earned. ‘You have all set an example that will be an inspiration for girls and women today, and for future generations. ‘It is my hope that you will be as proud of the impact you have had on your sport as you are of the result today.’ The future king also joined in the celebrations, with Prince William, who is second in line to the throne, shaking the hands of each team member after they secured the trophy. Earlier today, Prince William shared a ‘good luck’ video made with his daughter Princess Charlotte, aged seven. In the recorded message, the Duke of Cambridge said: ‘We both want to wish the Lionesses the best of luck for tonight. ‘You’ve done amazingly well in the competition and we are rooting for you all the way.’ Filmed beside her dad in a garden, Charlotte added: ‘Good luck, I hope you win’. Smiling at the camera, she then waved and said ‘bye’. England won the European Women’s Football Championships in front of an 87,000-strong crowd at Wembley Stadium tonight. The team beat Germany 2-1 after extra time, securing the first major tournament title for any England team since 1966. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
