Naked and Afraid contestant Melanie Rauscher has reportedly died at the age of 35 under ‘mysterious circumstances’. Rauscher, who appeared on two seasons of the survival show, was found dead at a friend’s home on July 17. She was dogsitting at a residence in Prescott, Arizona while the homeowners were on vacation, Corey Kasun, a spokesperson for the local police department, reportedly said (via TMZ). According to the outlet, he added that the homeowners returned and discovered Rauscher deceased on the bed in the guest room. The dog was reportedly not harmed. The Yavapai County Medical Examiner will now determine Rauscher’s cause of death. Naked and Afraid sees contestants travel to hostile environments to test their survival skills without modern conveniences or clothing. Rauscher appeared on Naked and Afraid in 2013 and then again in the spin-off show XL. TMZ reports that close castmate Jeremy Mccaa, who has turned his Instagram account to private, paid tribute, saying he was ‘broken’. Metro.co.uk has contacted Prescott Police Department and the Discovery Channel for comment.
