A British tourist is fighting for his life after tumbling from a second-floor balcony in Ibiza. The man, 21, plunged to the ground from his holiday accommodation in the popular party resort of Playa d’en Bossa at 5.30am on Thursday. He has been admitted to an intensive care unit at the private Nuestra Senora del Rosario clinic with head injuries. Local reports quoting San Jose Town Hall sources claim the man was trying to jump between balconies when he fell. The unnamed tourist is believed to have been staying at adult-only Jet apartments. Carl Shepherd, 28, known to pals and relatives as Daniel, died at the apartment complex in August 2017 after a three-floor 5.30am plunge. It was reported afterwards the Brit had fallen asleep on a ledge between the terrace of the apartment he was in and a neighbouring apartment. Well-placed sources revealed at the time police had taken away several laughing gas canisters they found in the apartment he was sharing with friends. Officers also discovered several bottles of alcohol lying around on the floor of the flat. Friends insisted they didn’t play the ‘key’ part in his death and described the electrician, who grew up in London and had dual-US citizenship, as a ‘deeply-loved, warm and charismatic man’. It also emerged he was a cousin of British producer and actress Aletha Shepherd, a former Miss World Guyana. In 2019 Carl’s mum said after his inquest she suspected foul play.
