What can £10million get you? It seems an ‘architectural masterpiece’ could be yours for that price, according to a new property listing. A stunning eight-bedroom property is up for sale with a multi-level infinity pool, offering incredible views of the Pacific Ocean. Perched on the cliffs of the iconic Pedregal neighbourhood, the property’s setting is just as impressive as its split-level structure. Named The Mantea Casa Cabo, the house has luxury at every turn, including marble floors, a gym, a sauna, a swim-up bar, an outdoor kitchen and a cinema area. And, if that wasn’t enough, the main bedroom even has a private pool. Inside, the dining spaces have a light and airy feel to them, while the bedrooms are a slightly different vibe with dark wood and cool tones. There are plenty of spots for relaxing and sunbathing too – thanks to the multi-level design. And this can continue at the house’s professional spa, where massage tables and sunken-style baths offer more relaxation space. The 10-bathroom property is on the market with Luxury Portfolio International for $12 million (around £10million). Feast on more snaps of the luxury listing below: Do you have a story to share?
