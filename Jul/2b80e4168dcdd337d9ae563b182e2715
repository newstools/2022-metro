Four people are reportedly dead after a mass shooting at a state park in Iowa. Officers responded to a report of a shooting at a campground in Maquoketa Caves State Park just before 6.30 on Friday morning, according to the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. They arrived to find three people killed by gunshot wounds in a tent. Authorities have not yet released the names of the victims, but did confirm that they were related. Another camper, 23-year-old Anthony Orlando Sherwin, of Nebraska, was reported missing. ‘He was known to be armed. That of course heightened our awareness as well,’ said IDCI assistant director Mitch Mortvedt. Authorities found Sherwin using a plane to search the area west of the park. He was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Camp Shalom, a nearby Christian summer camp, was locked down and evacuated. All campers were reportedly accounted for. Maquoketa Caves State Park remains closed, but police said there is no longer a threat to the public. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
