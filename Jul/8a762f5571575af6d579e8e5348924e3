Tropical weather will hit the UK in the coming days with ‘muggy’ conditions bringing a mixture of 29°C heat and rain. Heavy showers moving in from the Atlantic are set to lash parts of the country over the weekend, while southern and eastern areas will be hot and humid, forecasters say. Thunderstorms may rumble before temperatures push into the high 20s from Monday. Met Office forecaster Tom Morgan said: ‘Many areas will be very warm and humid with plenty of cloud around, even overnight, with temperatures as high as 20°C in the early hours – meaning uncomfortable evenings for sleeping are in store. ‘The odd rumble of thunder may be heard in isolated areas, and it’s going to be pretty muggy and humid, typical of conditions seen in tropical countries. ‘Temperatures could climb as high as 29°C during the day in southern areas, but it’s going to feel uncomfortable and clammy.’ Around 30 to 40mm of rain could fall over Monday and Tuesday in northern, central and western areas, but ‘nothing too disruptive’ and ‘useful for farmers and gardeners’. The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) has specific worries about farmers struggling with a lack of rainfall and grass growth in central, eastern and southern parts of the country. Just last week, England was warned it could be facing a drought with restrictions on water usage if the dry weather continued. The right amount of rain could offset this threat and it looks like the country may get it. But the rain will not be around for too long, as things are expected to get fresher and drier from Wednesday – with temperatures in their low 20s.
