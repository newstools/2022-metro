One might assume he would get his information straight from the horse’s mouth. But Stanley Johnson has been pictured reading none other than Metro to get the latest on his son’s fight for political survival. The 81-year-old was spotted on the Piccadilly line of the Tube reading Wednesday’s edition of the newspaper – as the Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s leadership was on a knife-edge. The splash reads ‘Going! Going! Gone?’ in reference to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid sensationally quitting their Cabinet posts within minutes of each other on Tuesday evening. The pair handed in their notice in the wake of allegations against disgraced deputy chief whip, Chris Pincher, which the Tory leader initially denied knowledge of. But the bombshell resignations sparked a wave of almost 60 MPs following suit, forcing Mr Johnson to announce he was stepping down on Thursday. I’m A Celebrity star Stanley slammed the ‘Westminster witch hunt’ as ‘complete madness’ hours before his son threw in the towel. During an interview with Dan Wootton on GB News, he said: ‘I’m here to praise Boris not bury him, if you look at the facts, his achievements have been extraordinary.’ And when quizzed about whether the PM would step down, his father said: ‘I absolutely don’t see it’, suggesting he had been ‘derailed’ for ‘completely inconsequential reasons’. Last month Stanley jumped to the defence of his son, 58, over Partygate, insisting he had made the right calls on big issues. He slammed claims the PM was amoral as ‘garbage’ – and insisted everyone needed to move on from the scandal. Stanley is himself no stranger to controversy after being accused of forcefully smacking Tory MP Caroline Noakes on the bottom during a Conservative party conference in 2003. He told Sky News he had ‘no recollection’ of the Romsey and Southampton North MP.
