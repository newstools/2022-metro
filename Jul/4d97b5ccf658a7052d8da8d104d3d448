Britain has been warned it needs to prepare for wildfires after dozens of unprecedented blazes broke out during last week’s record breaking temperatures. More resources will be required in cities and towns to fight the growing threat with much of the country facing continued hot and dry weather, fire chiefs said. David Swallow, tactical advisor for the National Fire Chiefs Council, said: ‘There are very urban services that think that wildfires are low down on the risk list. ‘I understand the need to prioritise resources, but there needs to be a review.’ It comes as people were urged to use water wisely with areas facing drought – and possible hosepipe bans – in August if the dry spell continues. The Environment Agency (EA) convened the National Drought Group yesterday, bringing together officials from the Environment Department (Defra), water companies, the Met Office, the National Farmers’ Union and others. Most of England has moved into prolonged dry weather status, meaning the EA is taking precautionary actions to mitigate impacts. Most water companies are maintaining good reservoir storage but if further measures are needed, temporary use bans will be determined by individual companies. London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Jonathan Smith told the BBC the service had already been preparing for an expected increased risk, but added that risk was now immediate. Last week, the service saw its busiest day since the Second World War, with crews attending 1,146 incidents in a single day. A total of 16 homes were lost in a large fire in Wennington, east London. Two people were taken to hospital after a blaze engulfed several boats at a marina at Yalding, Kent, on Sunday. The cause is being investigated. On Monday, Dorset fire crews spent hours fighting clifftop flames near Boscombe after tinder-dry heather and gorse caught fire. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
