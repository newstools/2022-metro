It’s hot. You know what that means: frozen sweet treats are the call of the day. Rather than bulk-buying cheap choc ices, though, why not try something a little different? These frozen strawberry kisses are super tasty, good for you, and easy to make. Plus, they require just two ingredients and no baking or mixing. My son loves these, and they’ll be happily munched up by adults, too. They’re also great for teething babies, as a bonus. You can swap the strawberries for any berry you like.
