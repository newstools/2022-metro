Jacques O’Neill has quit Love Island, it’s been confirmed. The rugby ace has left the villa after a row with Adam Collard was teased in last night’s episode. A Love Island spokesperson said: ‘Jacques has made the decision to leave the Villa. ‘He will explain his reasons to the Islanders during tonight’s episode. We fully support his decision and look forward to seeing what’s next for Jacques.’ Jacques has endured a tumultuous couple of weeks after kissing Cheyanne Kerr during Casa Amor week, and subsequently upsetting Paige Thorne. During last night’s episode, he wrote her a grovelling apology which appeared to go down well – until the arrival of Adam. Adam cracked on with Paige who was clearly bowled over by the returning islander. In a teaser for tonight’s episode, it was suggested Adam told Paige his opinion of Jacques which didn’t go down well. Jacques was then seen blowing up, snapping: ‘Who the f**k is he?’ Just last week, Jacques also contemplated quitting the show once it looked as though his relationship with Paige was well and truly over. His behaviour in Casa Amor sparked enormous backlash from viewers, which didn’t get any better when Paige returned to the villa and initially he refused to apologise for kissing another girl. His family later confirmed he lives with ADHD and struggles with emotions. They did, however, stress that was not a ‘get-out clause’ for his actions. Jacques becomes the second islander to quit Love Island 2022 after Liam Llewellyn walked just days into the series. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
