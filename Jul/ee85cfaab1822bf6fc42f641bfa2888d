Three children are fighting for their lives in hospital after a fire broke out at a derelict pub. Firefighters rescued them after being scrambled to The Woodman pub in Stockport at 8.30pm last night. Paramedics rushed them in an ambulance to hospital, where their condition is described as ‘critical’. It’s understood the children are aged between 12 and 13 and suffered serious burns. Greater Manchester Police said detectives believe the fire was started ‘deliberately’. No further details were revealed, but officers issued a warning to all children about the dangers of playing in disused buildings during the summer holidays. Locals reportedly tried to open a door in a bid to save the kids before firefighters ripped it off its hinges and bravely entered the pub. The pub on London Road closed in 2011 and there have previously been fires reported within the boarded-up site. Detective Inspector Chris Aunins said: ‘We have launched an investigation in conjunction with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service into how the fire started. ‘We believe that it may have been started deliberately and so we are appealing for anyone with information, or anyone who may have dash cam footage to get in touch with police to help with our enquiries. ‘Now we are in the school summer holiday period, I’d like to appeal to parents and carers to explain to children the dangers of playing within disused buildings, as they pose a really serious risk with a number of potential dangers within them.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
