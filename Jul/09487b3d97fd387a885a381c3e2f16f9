Terrifying video has shown the moment a monkey brutally attacked a two-year-old girl. The child, a refugee from Ukraine called Paulina, had been playing outside when the animal suddenly appeared. Tugging her to the ground, the animal is seen in the footage viciously biting the young girl. Her screams were heard by her parents who rushed outside. Even as the girl’s mother picks her up, the monkey still lunges and grabs Paulina’s legs in a bid to continue its horrific attack. Her father can be seen in the video trying to kick the primate, but it shows little fear. Paulina is now fighting for her life in intensive care after the horrific ordeal, which took place in the Russian village of Terpigorievo. Her wounds, including lacerations on her arms and legs and serious blood loss, have been described as ‘severe’. The monkey had reportedly escaped from a ‘pet zoo’ belonging to a millionaire in a next door property. The wealthy neighbours also keep wolves, elephants and other wild animals near their home. ‘The parents came running to the screams and with difficulty freed their daughter from the animal’s clutches,’ said one local report. The victim was described as a refugee child from the war in Ukraine. Her parents are friends of the owner of the house where the attack took place. They had given the family refuge from the war started in February by Vladimir Putin. Police are now investigating the attack after the parents made a complaint, with  a criminal investigation underway. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
