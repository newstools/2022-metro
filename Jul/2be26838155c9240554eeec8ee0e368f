Love Island’s Ekin-su Cülcüloğlu is in tears during tonight’s episode, thinking about having babies with Davide Sanclimenti. After officially making Ekin-su his girlfriend via the power of tiramisu, she is feeling broody and emotional just days before the islanders will probably be welcoming the arrival of some weird baby dolls for that grim parents challenge. Looking head at her future with the Italian Stallion, Ekin tells Tasha Ghouri: ‘This place is magical. If we have kids I want to take them here,’ smiles Ekin-su. Excited, Tahsa replies: ‘Oh my god it’d be like, “This is where I met your dad!”’ Tearing up, Ekin-su enthuses: ‘Oh stop, you’re going to make me cry!’ Ekin-su and Davide are runaway firm favourites to win Love Island and have just been going from strength—to-strength in the days leading up to the final. Last night, Davide asked Ekin to be his girlfriend but Gemma and Luca Bish were quite literally the only people watching on and scowling. ‘We didn’t do something like that to know that we are exclusive and I’d prefer it to be this way,’ she said. But viewers were baffled and after Luca fell out of favour with the public, it only made matters worse. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
