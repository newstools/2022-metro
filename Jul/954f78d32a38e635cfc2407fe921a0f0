A man is in hospital with serious injuries after his home burst into flames following an explosion in the middle of the night. The detached £850,000 house, in Upper Basildon, Berkshire, has been completely destroyed by the blaze. Eight fire engines were called to the scene, and firefighters managed to stop the fire spreading to the neighbouring property. The house has been reduced to a shell, as drone footage reveals the roof completely destroyed with much of the interior incinerated.
