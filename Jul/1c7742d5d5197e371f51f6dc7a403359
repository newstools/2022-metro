For those of us trying desperately to get on the property ladder, a £15k house sounds pretty appealing. And it’s true – this two-bedroom house in Barr, Ayrshire, Scotland, does have bags of potential, as a detached home with its own driveway and garage, plus an enclosed courtyard. There’s just one – pretty major – problem: the property is missing a roof. Although perhaps you could spin that as a natural skylight? The house has a massive hole in the roof thanks to a fire, which has also left damage to the interiors. Some rafters remain, but they’re a tad charred, the windows are smashed, and there’s debris strewn across the drive. Oh, and potential buyers can’t have a peek inside due to safety issues. All that goes quite a way to explain the budget-friendly price tag. The house is being sold at auction by Slater Hogg and Howison, with starting bids at £13,500 and a £15,000 reserve. The listing reads: ‘Well located in the centre of the picturesque conservation village of Barr in Ayrshire. ‘Barr is nestled amidst the Carrick hills beside the converging rivers of Stinchar and Greg. ‘The site contains the remains of a significantly fire damaged two storey, two bedroom villa. ‘Externally the garden to the front of the property is paved and chipped, and to the left of the property is a driveway that leads to the attached garage. ‘To the rear of the property is an enclosed court yard and accessed from the garage and the living room of the property. ‘Please note that the property and land are sold as seen and can only be viewed externally for obvious safety reasons.’ If you fancy putting in a bid, you can find out more through the listing online.
