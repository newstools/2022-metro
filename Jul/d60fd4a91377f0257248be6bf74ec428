Turns out, Alexa can be your best friend this Amazon Prime Day, helping you access secret deals. This year, Amazon has announced its annual Prime Day sales event will return on July 12 and 13 for 48 hours. The online retailer usually knocks even more coin off its Fire TV and Echo smart speaker products – as long as you ask Alexa about it. So, if you have one of Amazon’s various Echo devices, you already have an upper hand. These Alexa-only discounts offer extra savings on top of the Prime Day discounts. Just ask Alexa, ‘What are my deals?’ to find discounts you otherwise would have missed. The deals are significant, especially on Amazon devices like Kindles and Fire TVs, as well as third party retailer items like headphones and smart speakers, with discounts up to 50% off. If you want the exclusive discounts through Alexa, you first need to have your Amazon Echo device set up for voice shopping. To do this: 1. Make sure you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network. 2. Open the Alexa app. 3. Select Devices on the menu bar. 4. Choose the Echo device you want to shop on. 5. Click the Settings icon in the upper right corner. 6. Scroll down until you see Follow-up Mode. 7. Turn on Follow-up Mode. 8. Repeat for all voice shopping devices in the Alexa mobile app. You’re all set! Now if you ask Alexa, ‘What are my deals?’ she should begin listing off some solid discounts. For future reference, Alexa-only deals are a thing even outside the Prime Day sales so you might want to set up voice shopping anyway. Shopping: This article contains affiliate links.
