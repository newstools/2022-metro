A driver was lucky not to be hit by a train during a dramatic chase involving armed officers. The suspect rammed his car through a gate and attempted to get away from officers by driving up a track in Essex. Police drafted in sniffer dogs and a helicopter when the man ditched his vehicle and ran off, according to the force. The incident happened overnight near Chelmsford and involved a Fiat 500.
