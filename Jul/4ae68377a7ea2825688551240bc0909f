Pesky seagulls are famous for their chip-stealing exploits at Britain’s abundance of beaches and coastal towns. But chips were off the menu for this big bird in St Helier, Jersey, who was spotted with a whole pigeon in its mouth. Stunned bystander Cameron Maguire could not tell whether the pigeon was dead or alive, as the seagull ploded by with it dangling from its beak. ‘I have seen seagull’s attack pigeons before so I wouldn’t be surprised if it killed it,’ Cameron said. ‘Plus, it’s a black back gull. Those are the largest seagulls you can get, they’re like the daddies over here. ‘It was only that morning when one snuck between my legs at lunch trying to steal my food, they don’t have much fear. ‘I didn’t think too much of it, nature is crazy like that. Cameron believes seagulls are misunderstood and are actually good at heart. He added: ‘Sometimes I think they are pests, they make a racket at all hours, day and night. They rip bin bags up and leave a mess and swoop for food. ‘I even saw one fake a limp to get some of someone’s sandwich once believe it or not, proper little cheeky chops. ‘But, they aren’t bad, just misunderstood and just trying to survive.’ It is not the first time seagulls have brazenly show their greedy behaviour. One recently divebombed an unsuspecting elderly couple in Dorset, stealing their chips as they sat on the seafront. The woman was oblivious to the approaching bird, as she paused for a moment with a sizable chip in her grasp. It immediately grabbed the chip and flew off before she could do anything.
