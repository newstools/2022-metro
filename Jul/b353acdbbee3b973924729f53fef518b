Tributes have poured in for a 25-year-old mum who died after falling out of bed and having a seizure during the night. Natasha Simpson, known as Tasha, was rushed to hospital from her home in Rhyl, North Wales, earlier this month. Doctors found an aneurysm in her brain and immediately had her airlifted to a specialist unit more than 100 miles away in Stoke. But the aneurysm – an abnormal bulge in a blood vessel – then ruptured, causing a ‘catastrophic bleed’. She was placed on life support after arriving on July 3 and was tragically pronounced dead on July 5, leaving behind her two-year-old daughter Naylah. Tasha’s sister-in-law, Sasha, said the child is ‘completely destroyed at the loss of her mother’. ‘Tasha was so full of life and had everything to live for,’ she added. The family is asking for donations via a Gofundme page to help with funeral costs and to help Tasha’s mother Debbie, 59, look after her granddaughter. A statement released by Sasha said: ‘Debbie is having such a hard time, both financially and emotionally. ‘Not only has she lost her daughter, and best friend, but, she now finds herself looking after Tasha’s daughter, Naylah, who is also grieving. ‘Debbie isn’t in great health herself, so is reliant on benefits, and no one expects to lose their daughter at 25, so no funeral plans had been put in place. ‘I am trying to raise some money, not only to help with the funeral, but, to give Naylah a couple of days out, maybe a little holiday once the funeral is over, something nice for her to help ease the grief.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
