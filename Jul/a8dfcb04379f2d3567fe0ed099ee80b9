Picking a hotel can feel overwhelming at times – as there’s so much choice out there. But every year the team Travel + Leisure make things a little easier, by rating hotels around the world based on their facilities, service, food and value. As a result, they compile some of the best hotels in the world – and the 2022 rankings are in. This year, it’s a hotel in Montalcino, Italy, that takes the top spot – called Rosewood Castiglion del Bosco. There’s no denying that the stunning scenery perhaps explains why this spot scoops first place – as Castiglion del Bosco is an 800-year-old estate in Tuscany surrounded by vineyards, on a 5,000-acre plot. It also boasts exceptional views of Unesco-protected Val d’Orcia Natural Park and the tiny hilltop town of Montalcino. The hotel itself is a delicate mix of traditional and contemporary and offers tennis courts, a spa, a cooking school and even a winery. Guests can pick from either 42 suites – with heritage features, antique furnishings, local textiles and artisanal accessories – or 11 one-of-a-kind luxury Tuscan villas dotted across the landscape. But this stunning setting will cost you, as prices for this luxury hotel start from €1,280 (around £1,095) per night. Close behind on the list of ‘best hotels’ is Grace Hotel in Santorini in second place, as well as the Waldorf Astoria Maldives Ithaafushi in third, which is on the South Malé Atoll in the Maldives.
