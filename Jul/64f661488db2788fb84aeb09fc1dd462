This is Reggie, the sweet dog who desperately needed a facelift. No, it wasn’t to make him look younger – don’t be fooled by his wrinkles, the little guy is only 18 months old. Thanks to the physical traits of his breed, the Shar Pei needed excess skin removed from his face so he could see. The rescue dog was signed over to the RSPCA Sussex, Brighton and East Grinstead branch in May, after living in unsuitable conditions. He was in a pretty bad way when staff first met him, with infected eyes and sore skin. But, even with his hard start in life, Reggie is still ‘a sweetheart’. Deputy head of dogs Lauren Pearce said: ‘He was bald with really sore skin on his back and infected eyes. ‘His vision was poor and he needed constant eye treatment so we worked with a vet to find a long-term solution.’ Two weeks ago, Reggie had surgery to help reduce the excess skin covering his face. Now, he’s recovered and is ready to find a forever home. Lauren said: ‘He is such a sweetheart, so so friendly and loves everyone. We’d like him to live in an adult-only home as he isn’t used to children, and it would be great if he could live with more experienced owners. ‘Sadly Reggie’s breed is prone to having problems due to their extra skin but with the treatment he’s had, we hope that this will help prevent further skin problems in the future. ‘Reggie is now fully recovered from his surgery and doesn’t need any medication. ‘He’s a young dog, so we hope the right person comes forward, so he can get stuck into enjoying his new life.’ If you think you could be right for Reggie, you can check out his profile on the RSPCA website.
