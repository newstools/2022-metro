Aldi has a number of offers in the middle aisle every week – called Specialbuys. From egg chairs to bedding, and fire pits to gin, there are always some great deals to be found. If you’re planning ahead to visit the iconic middle aisle – or you prefer to get your bargains online – we’ve got you covered. Here are our top picks of this week’s Aldi Specialbuys. This week, Aldi is packed with items for getting outside, from children’s garden toys to sun loungers. There’s also a chic dog bed with a built-in shade, so your pets can get in on the sunshine snoozing too. This dog bed matches the human-sized rattan garden furniture from Aldi, so your pet will be sitting pretty. With a collapsible shade (that’s water repellent and protects against UV rays) and a removable water bowl, it’ll be their new favourite spot to relax. Buy for £99.99 on the Aldi website now.
