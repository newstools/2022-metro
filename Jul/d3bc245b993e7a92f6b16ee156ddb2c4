Kate Garraway has revealed that her husband Derek Draper is now on the road to recovery after being in intensive care and ‘fighting for his life’ earlier this month. The Good Morning Britain presenter has been absent from presenting duties for the past two weeks to care for her partner, who has struggled with ongoing health issues since falling ill with Covid in March 2020 and subsequently falling into a coma. Derek was initially admitted to hospital after taking an ‘unexpected’ turn, however, Kate has now confirmed that he’s doing much better and that she will be returning to work on Monday. Taking to Twitter, she penned: ‘Thank you so so much for all your messages of support – they really do mean the world. ‘I’ve been off @gmb @smoothradio as Derek’s health took an unexpected & frightening turn for the worse that landed him back in intensive care & fighting for his life – again.’ Kate shared more details in a post on Instagram, adding: ‘Thanks to the extraordinary NHS teams & his own amazing life force & spirit Derek -please 🙏 God – is back on the right side of it now and I’m so looking forward to seeing you all back on @gmb from 6 a.m tomorrow & @smoothradio – hopefully celebrating @lionesses #worldcup win! Love ❤️ & see you in the morning!’ On Wednesday, July 20, a source confirmed Derek had been taken back to hospital ‘in a very serious condition’. ‘The family is very worried about him but Derek is in the best hands,’ the insider added to The Sun. ‘Kate is by his side and is keeping it together as best she can. She’s a total professional and devoted to her work – both on Good Morning Britain and Smooth – but she had no choice but to step away this week to be there with him. ‘This is an incredibly difficult time for her and their family.’ Derek has suffered long-lasting damage to his organs and requires daily care after contracting Covid two years ago. Last year, Kate won a prize at the National Television Awards for the documentary Finding Derek, which detailed her husband’s treatment and his subsequent return to their family home. Got a story?
