Jordan Pickford and Megan Davison have finally granted a peek inside their lavish beach wedding in the Maldives, a day they waited over two years for amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The couple, who legally tied the knot in March 2020, were at last able to celebrate their marriage with the spectacular day of their dreams on June 18. Taking to Instagram on Wednesday to share the first pictures of their idyllic ceremony, surrounded by friends and family, the pair wrote: ‘Worth the wait for the most magical day with my soulmate 🤍 Introducing The Pickfords.’ Shortly afterwards, Megan updated her Instagram user name to take her husband’s surname. The childhood sweethearts, who have been dating since the ages of 14 and 16, said their vows on a pink and white-flower festooned podium, surrounded by pampas grass, on the tip of a stunning white sand beach. They married for the second time in front of a small crowd of 13 friends and family. Gorgeous photos showed the Everton player and Euro 2020 star, 28, holding his wife, 26, up as they kissed, while in another they were seen throwing their heads back with laughter. Their three-year-old son, Arlo, also featured, wearing a matching cream linen suit to his dad’s, and being snuggled between both parents for a kiss. The pair were seen beaming with joy as they walked down the aisle after the ceremony, hand-in-hand, as they were met with confetti. England goalkeeper Jordan also spun Megan around for a twirl as they danced on the beach barefoot later on. Megan wowed in fishtail, off-the-shoulder bridal gown from the Autumn/Winter 2019 Athens collection by Berta fashion house. The dress featured corset detailing and appliqué flowers, which she paired with a floor-length veil and matching flower crown in her loose blonde hair. New husband Jordan was in a three-piece cream suit with beige bowtie and a pampas grass and flower corsage. Another sweet picture was shared to Megan’s stories on Instagram, with the mum joking it was a ‘tear-jerker’ as her son held up a sign during the ceremony reading: ‘Daddy, here comes Mummy!’ as he held her hand. Friends gushed over the stunning photos and offered their congratulations to the couple. ‘Oh my god 😍😍😍😍😍 this is beyond stunning lass 😮,’ wrote Vicky Pattison. Footballer Kevin De Bruyne’s wife Michele Lacroix added: ‘Congratulations 😍😍😍’ ‘The most gorgeous piks [sic] of the most beautiful intimate day! Love u both ♾ together,’ commented Italian footballer Fabio Borini’s wife Erin. Jordan and Megan legally wed in a casual ceremony in March 2020, reportedly with just their son and five guests in attendance at a registry office in Crewe, Cheshire. It’s understood that the couple also planned a larger party for family and friends in Sunderland, following their delayed more intimate Maldives marriage, which was initially planned for May 2020.
