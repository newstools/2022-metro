Love Island’s Coco Lodge has claimed some of the male islanders made ‘sexist’ remarks about her looks when the cameras weren’t rolling. The contestant, 27, was axed from the show this week after a rough deal when she was pied off by Andrew Le Page, 27, as soon as Tasha Ghouri, 23, returned from Casa Amor. Coco admitted she was left ‘lovely and bored’ being single in the villa, and to make matters worse she had to deal with vile remarks from some of the boys, who she claims compared her to the other girls and rated her a ‘four our of 10’. ‘There was comments made when the filming was off that I was a four out of 10 by some of the boys,’ Coco said on the Murad Merali podcast. ‘I don’t know who said it, Summer heard it.’ Calling the remarks ‘sexist’, she continued: ‘Yeah, you’re a four out of 10, Paige is a 12. I think they said it to Paige, I don’t really know. ‘These comments were made and I had a really hard time in there as it was. I was crying a lot for the first few days.’ Coco added that when she came out to see the public’s cruel remarks, they were just as hurtful. ‘I didn’t expect it,’ she said. ’It hurts to see because it’s about your appearance. ‘How I was perceived on the show isn’t my personality, they’ve edited me to look a certain way. But to comment about my appearance is honestly hurtful… They don’t choose the most flattering stuff.’ Coco also said this week her dad even called Love Island producers to complain about her edit on the show.
