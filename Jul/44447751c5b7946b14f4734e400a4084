Four bodies that were pulled from a pond have been confirmed as those of a father and his three children who went on a fishing trip and were missing for a week. The body of Kyle Moorman, 27, was found in the body of water near Bluff Road and Troy Avenue in Indianapolis on Tuesday evening, according to Fox 59. About five hours later, around 1.15am on Wednesday, fire department divers recovered a vehicle matching the description of the black Saab that Moorman was last seen inside. Three children were found dead inside the car. The Marion County Coroner’s Office identified them as Kyle Moorman II, 5; Kyannah Holland, 2; and Kyran Holland, 1. Their cause and manner of death have not yet been determined. Moorman took his kids to the pond on the evening of July 6, and his cell phone was last active at 12.48am the following day, his loved ones said. Family members searched the pond section for several days, as some expressed frustration that investigators apparently did not look in the area sooner. ‘We’ve been out here alone,’ Moornman’s sister Mariah Moorman told the TV station on Monday evening. Moorman’s aunt, Gloria Hamblen, said, ‘Nobody (will) help us’. Meanwhile, Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Assistant Chief Chris Bailey insisted that officers were trying their hardest on the case. ‘These are answers we might not ever have the answers to, but I guarantee you the detectives that are working behind me will do everything they can to provide answers to this family and our community,’ Bailey told Fox 59 at the scene. Crews with the TV station said they saw verbal confrontations between Moorman’s family and law enforcement officials in the course of the search. The Moorman family went so far as offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the whereabouts of Moorman and his children.
