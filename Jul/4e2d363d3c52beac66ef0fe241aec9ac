Soldiers from Ukraine have been seen flying the country’s flag after they recaptured Snake Island from Russia. The island gained international attention on the first day of the war when Russia seized it, with Ukrainian border guards rejecting calls to surrender. Ukrainian soldiers went viral after telling Russian sailors aboard the Moskva warship to ‘go f**k yourself’ over a loudspeaker. The island was soon captured by Russia despite the heroic efforts of Ukrainian soldiers to try and keep them at bay. Russia’s defence ministry recently claimed it had withdrawn to show Moscow is not interfering with UN efforts to export Ukrainian agricultural products. But Kremlin fighters have suffered massive blows around the area of south Ukraine in the past few weeks and Kyiv claimed to have regained control. The island is a prized strategic location, as it sits 80 miles off Ukraine’s south coast. In recent weeks, Kyiv has hit the island with air strikes to drive Russia out. Talking about the occupation on the island, spokesperson Natalia Humeniuk said: ‘The military operation has been concluded, and the territory (Snake Island) has been returned to the jurisdiction of Ukraine.’ Russian blockades of other ports in Ukraine are currently making it impossible to export grain to large parts of the world. Russia losing grip of Snake Island is expected to alleviate the problem of exporting grain. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
