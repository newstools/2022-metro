A pensioner was given an £100 parking fine – after she got stuck in a car wash queue. Colleen Russell, 69, received the parking penalty despite never actually leaving her vehicle during her visit. The pensioner drove to Sutton Court Service Station to use its car wash but on her arrival, was met with a 30 minute queue on June 25. She said the owners of the car park, have cameras monitoring the forecourt – fining anyone who stays for more than 30 minutes without a ticket. But the technology doesn’t take into account cars using the car wash on busy days. A week after her visit, Colleen, received a £100 parking fine from Euro Car Parks through the post. Colleen, a retired carer from Sutton, Surrey, said: ‘I’ve been going there for over 10 years, and this has never happened before. ‘I didn’t go in for petrol, and I didn’t go in to park – I was just in the queue for the car wash.’ ‘There were four cars in the line so I had to wait my turn to use the facility. ‘I’d like to know whether those cars were fined as well as they were also queuing just like me. ‘I just think it’s so unfair, especially because I’m a pensioner.’ Colleen has appealed the decision.
