Skepta has revealed he’s currently in hospital with a mystery illness after posting from a bed. The 39-year-old grime artist, real name Joseph Olaitan Adenuga Jr, asked his fans to keep him in their prayers as he shared news of his admission. Uploading a photo from the ward to his Instagram Stories, the Boy Better Know appeared to be lying down wearing a hospital gown. ‘Say a little prayer for me,’ Skepta penned along with the prayer hands emoji. While the reason for his hospital dash currently remains unknown, Skepta is currently on tour and due to perform at Rolling Loud Festival in Portugal on Thursday. Next weekend, he’s billed on the Gurtenfestival in Switzerland, which will also see performances from the likes of Erykah Badu, Jamie XX, Megan Thee Stallion, and Kokoroko. Earlier this year, Skepta said he couldn’t stop crying after fasting during Ramadan. ‘I woke up this morning happy and full of joy,’ he wrote on his Instagram story on the morning of Eid. ‘Everything I searched for in psychedelics, I found by fasting.’ ‘I’m so thankful and will definitely be fasting again, even on regular days simply because it is so humbling. Love to my brothers and sisters that fasted for Ramadan,’ Skepta added. Got a story?
