A Russian vodka tycoon who sacked a UK executive because he objected to ‘brutal’ staff pay cuts during the pandemic must pay him £1.6 million compensation. Yuri Shefler, 54, fired Vlad Zabelin over the phone to ‘punish’ the £180,000-a-year chief investment officer for complaining, a tribunal heard. Mr Zabelin accused Shefler, owner of Stolichnaya vodka maker SPI Group, of using Covid ‘as an excuse’ to impose the ‘unnecessary’ salary cuts when the firm was still making profits. But the billionaire – who has a Surrey mansion he bought for £14.5 million in 2008 – ‘lost patience’ with his executive and sacked him ‘out of hand’. Employment Judge Lewis awarded London-based Mr Zabelin £1,626,452 for unfair dismissal, finding against Shefler and UK subsidiary SPI Spirits. The tribunal was told that Shefler, who is married to a Victoria’s Secret model and is reportedly worth £2 billion, had slashed the pay of all his 2,000 workers by 30% when the pandemic hit. In March 2020 Mr Zabelin initially agreed to a salary cut for three months but was later informed it would continue – despite SPI ‘continuing to engage in expensive mergers and acquisitions’. In a phone call from Shefler in June that year, Mr Zabelin ‘expressed concern’ that SPI was using the pandemic as an excuse to cut pay and bonuses. As a result, Shefler ‘told him out of the blue’ that he was being dismissed, the judge said. Shefler, who has four children with model Tatiana Kovylina, 40, featured in Forbes’ list of the world’s richest billionaires in 2021.
