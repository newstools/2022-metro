Britain’s first hosepipe ban of the summer is being introduced after England experienced its driest July in more than 100 years. Southern Water’s temporary use ban will come into force for around 1.5 million people covering parts of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight on August 5. Bosses insisted there is no direct risk to customers’ water supplies but urged them to ‘act responsibly’ as they announced the measure. The company then issued a bizarre tweet suggesting people only fill up paddling pools ‘half way’ even though most will be forbidden from almost any outdoor water use in the coming days. It’s the first measure of its kind to be imposed in the region since 2012, and there is no indication how long it will last. The move was said to be ‘vital’ to protecting flora and fauna in the River Test and River Itchen where Southern Water sources its supplies. River flows were around a quarter below typical July levels, equivalent to a loss of around 25 million bathtubs of water, the company said. Overall rainfall this July has been less than a quarter of the average July in England, the Met Office added. England also saw its driest first half of the year since 1976. The ban means any households caught using a hosepipe for the following measures face criminal prosecution: There are some exceptions for businesses such as garden centres or car washes but many of these require special licenses. Dr Alison Hoyle, director of risk and compliance at Southern Water, said the decision was ‘not taken lightly’. Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
