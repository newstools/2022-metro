This is the moment that a new sinkhole emerged and swallowed a workman’s van. The back end of the vehicle was already hanging over the edge of the tarmac by the time a local TV station arrived. But then the floor gives way and the van rolls onto its side down the sinkhole in New York. Tony Papadodoulos, the van’s owner, can only watch on as it disappears into the abyss. Speaking to CBS2 he sadi: ‘I’m alright. I’m alright. Lose the van. Lose the van. It’s life.’ The sinkhole on Radcliffe Avenue in the Morris Park neighborhood of the Bronx had been growing and reached at least three car lengths. No one was injured. The sinkhole was filled in and an investigation has been started after it emerged that it is the second to emerge in less than a year. Resident Joey Saadah said: ‘It happened August 15 and it took them three months for them to fix the work and we didn’t have water. Now, we’re gonna have no water, of course.’ City Department of Environmental Protection officials were not able to immediately determine whether the massive storms on Monday caused the sinkhole to form. However, it began sinking and worsening during the deluge. The environmental protection department is investigating whether Monday’s sinkhole was related to the other one in the area last year. Flash floods on Monday inundated several lanes on the Major Deegan Expressway and caused a traffic backup. Water flowed over sidewalks and streets from Highbridge to Hunts Point.
