A popular paddling pool was closed in the sweltering heat after people used it to clean themselves. A group of travellers was seen using the water features at Fleming Park in Eastleigh to wash. It came after 30-35 caravans and vehicles camped without permission at a nearby encampment on Monday evening. Eastleigh Borough Council said they shut the paddling pool with immediate effect and would not open it until the group moved on. ‘Council officers have already visited the encampment (Tuesday 12 July) to request that the travelers leave the site and we are continuing to monitor the situation’, a statement said. This morning, it was announced that police had used Section 61 powers to ask them to leave the area. The pool is now open again after being drained, cleaned, refilled and the water quality tested. The Council said it had followed its ‘normal procedure’ for dealing with unauthorised encampments, as seen on its website. Those travelling are asked to contact local councils to apply for a pitch. Costs will usually include pitch fees, council tax and utilities like water. A Hampshire Constabulary spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: ‘Following a review of the circumstances, and in consultation with the landowners, the criteria for the use of Section 61 powers were met late last evening (12 July). ‘A request was made that the encampment leave the area, which they have since complied with.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
