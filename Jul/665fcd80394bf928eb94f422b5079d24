Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira has revealed that he has spoken to Jose Mourinho about joining Roma this summer. The Uruguay international has just spent the season on loan at Fiorentina but the Serie A club have not taken up their option of signing him on a permanent deal and have angered Arsenal by offering less than half of the €15 million (£12.8m) optional purchase clause which was agreed last year. Torreira has made it clear that his preference is to return to Fiorentina on a permanent deal having established himself as a key part of their midfield last season. But with Fiorentina unable to reach an agreement with Arsenal, Mourinho and Roma are now monitoring Torreira’s situation. ‘I spoke with Mourinho some time ago,’ Torreira told El Pais. ‘He’s a coach I admire, it’s a possibility that entices me, but it’s not easy.’ However, Torreira’s future at Arsenal may not be over completely as the 26-year-old has been included in the Gunners’ pre-season tour of the United States. ‘He would like to stay and play in Italy,’ Pablo Bentancur, Torreira’s agent, said over the weekend. ‘But today, Arsenal has called him up for the tour they will do in America, so he seems to be part of the program.’ Speaking last week, Torreira said about his future: ‘There is no chance [of staying at Arsenal]. ‘From the beginning they told me that I didn’t have a place, so I don’t want to stay either because I suffered a lot, it cost me a lot to adapt and my idea is to go to Italy or Spain. ‘What I wanted was to stay at Fiorentina, but it didn’t happen for various reasons, so we’ll look for a new direction.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
