A church has exhumed six graves in a bid to find a lost coffin after it had to tell a family they had been visiting the wrong plot for more than a decade. Now, a second family has been informed they have also been grieving at the incorrect grave for years. Tom Bell and his sisters were horrified when they were told the grave they believed their dad had been buried in for 17 years was in fact home to another coffin. The family only discovered the error after the death of their mum, Hilda,whose last wish was to be buried alongside her husband Thomas Bell atHoly Trinity Church, Wingate, County Durham. But when gravediggers came to prepare the grave for Hilda they discoveredthe coffin of a woman was buried where Thomas should have been. They then realised another man was also buried nearby. It is understood the relatives of the man, who like Thomas had been buried in the wrong location for years, have now been informed of the upsetting error. So far, six graves have been dug up in the search for Thomas’ coffin, yet his resting place has still not been found. It is understood a mix-up between the headstones on two plots after Thomas’ burial in 2005 along with inconsistent records after an original graveyard map was lost in a fire in the 1980s may be to blame for the error. The Bell family are now waiting for permission from the Chancellor of the Durham Diocese to exhume another grave where they believe Thomas’ coffin may lie. Tom Bell, a factory worker from Easington, Durham previously told of the hurt caused by the discovery. ‘Losing our mam was devastating,’ the 58 year-old said. ‘And then to be told the grave of our dad we have spent the last 17 yearsvisiting is not his is just unbearable. How could this happen? ‘Our mam is lying in a funeral home waiting to be buried and our dad issomewhere in the cemetery in an unmarked grave.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
