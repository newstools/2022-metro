Slouched over in the heat? Struggling to sit up straight? Pains from sleeping in a strange position? You’re probably desperate for something to sort your back out – but don’t want to pay a fortune. The good news is there’s an option out there for just £12.99 – the Houdian Back Stretcher Lumbar. Working to stretch out your body, it gently decompresses the discs in your vertebrae. This helps to relieve tension and pain – though, of course, any back injuries should be treated carefully with the help of a doctor. It’s recommended you use the device once or twice a day for five to 10 minutes each time. One happy customer said it was a good option for simple back stretching, while another said it was helping with their husband’s posture. Many who have experienced success with it say initially it’s uncomfortable – but then your back gets used to it. One woman with this experience wrote: ‘I feel realigned and any niggly pains in my lower back have been eased.’ If you’re in need of a quick fix at a low cost, this might do the trick.
