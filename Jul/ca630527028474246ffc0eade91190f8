The story of how BBC landed their famous interview with Prince Andrew is being turned into a film. The movie will reportedly delve into his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in a film called Scoop, Deadline understands Hugh Grant is on the shortlist of stars to portray the disgraced royal. Sam McAlister, who secured the chat with Prince Andrew, tweeted her excitement at the news finally being out in the open. ‘So here’s some news… can’t actually breathe with the excitement!!!! #Scoops #Scoop @thelighthouseft @BazBam @DEADLINE. ‘So…. Who should play me?’ McAlister spent 10 years producing interviews for the flagship BBC news programme Newsnight, and also just published a book with the same title. Scoops: Behind the Scenes of the BBC’s Most Shocking Interviews was released today, July 14. Acclaimed Your Honor screenwriter Peter Moffat is writing the script, while a director is yet to be found. Shooting is thought to be beginning in November. When asked by the publication about the plot, Moffat explained Scoop is ‘about how the BBC’s Newsnight team got the scoop, then the actual filming of it.’ He added: ‘The other thing is, “why did he agree to do it?”.’ The interview was dubbed a ‘car crash’ at the time, and Prince Andrew stepped away from his royal duties shortly afterwards. Earlier this year, he paid millions out of court to settle a civil sexual assault case brought by Ms Giuffre. He has consistently and vehemently denied all allegations against him. Got a story?
