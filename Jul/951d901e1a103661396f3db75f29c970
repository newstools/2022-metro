The two final candidates battling to be next Tory leader will lock horns in a live TV debate hosted by The Sun and TalkTV. Liz Truss – currently the favourite among Conservative members – will make the case for borrowing more and reducing taxes to fight the cost of living crisis. Rishi Sunak offers an alternative for the country, promising a ‘return to traditional Conservative economic values’ – seen as a return to instinctive Tory financial prudence. The debate will be held on Tuesday, July 26, and will be shown on TalkTV, following another debate planned on the BBC on Monday. Mr Sunak and Ms Truss have also signed up for a debate on Sky News on August 4. Tuesday’s debate will be hosted by political editor of The Sun Harry Cole and TalkTV’s political editor Kate McCann. The Sun’s editor-in-chief, Victoria Newton, said: ‘This is an important chance for Sun readers to quiz the two contenders vying to be their next PM, and ask questions about the issues that matter most to them and their families.’ Richard Wallace, head of TV, News UK Broadcasting, said: ‘TalkTV is proud to be showcasing The Sun’s critical all-live debate to decide the country’s next prime minister. ‘This synergy between The Sun and TalkTV will give the UK a great opportunity to see the candidates put through their paces.’ Since the start of the campaign, the two candidates have clashed more so than any other candidates. Foreign Secretary Ms Truss recently lashed out at Mr Sunak, claiming he would be taking the country in the wrong direction with his record over taxation. But her rival, who resigned as Chancellor earlier this month, has criticised the ‘comforting fairytales’ offered by other candidates. Mr Sunak said he would like to cut taxes but wanted to get a grip on inflation first. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
