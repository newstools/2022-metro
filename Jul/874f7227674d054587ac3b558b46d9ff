Erik ten Hag says ‘certain demands’ must be met at the club after footage emerged of the Dutchman criticising Jadon Sancho in training. The United boss has impressed the squad during pre-season by taking each training session, rather than delegating to his coaches. Ten Hag is famously intense and the former Ajax boss has a clear philosophy and idea of how he wants his team to play. While he does allow freedom in the final third, Ten Hag is trying to implement patterns of play that his side can rely on. In order to drum that into his players, Ten Hag has been on their case in training and has stopped sessions when they’ve failed to follow his orders. On the start of the side’s tour in Thailand, a clip went viral on social media of Ten Hag lambasting Sancho after the winger failed to deliver a pass to an overlapping defender during a training exercise. Ten Hag can be heard shouting ‘Hey! Jadon! Pass!’ to Sancho after he refused to listen to his advice. But Ten Hag insists he treats every player the same and that his criticism is designed to keep up ‘high standards’. Asked about his criticism of Sancho, Ten Hag said: ‘I look to the player and I have a certain demand.‘And I will tell them, if they have capabilities, but you have to invest. It is not just in terms of Jadon, it is for every player. ‘I will tell every player what I expect of them. I have high standards because you are here, you are playing for Manchester United, then you must bring every day on the pitch. That is an expectation I have.’ MORE : ‘The captain is really important’ – Erik ten Hag sends message to Harry Maguire following Lisandro Martinez signing MORE : Thomas Tuchel explains why four Chelsea players have left pre-season training camp For more stories like this, check our sport page.
