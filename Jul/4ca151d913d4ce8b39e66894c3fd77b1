Erik ten Hag is adamant that Manchester United will not sell Cristiano Ronaldo this summer. Ronaldo is pushing to leave Old Trafford before the end of the transfer window following a woeful campaign in which United delivered their worst-ever Premier League season. The 37-year-old did not report for pre-season training with United last week due to ‘family reasons’ and has not travelled with the squad for the start of their tour in Bangkok. But Ten Hag insists Ronaldo remains in his plans, despite his apparent desire to quit United. ‘He’s not with us, it is due to personal issues,’ Ten Hag said at a press conference in Thailand on Monday. Asked if Ronaldo would be sold this summer, Ten Hag replied: ‘No, we are planning with Ronaldo for this season, so that’s it and I am looking forward to working with him. ‘I don’t know, he hasn’t told me this so I have read but what I say Cristiano is not for sale, he’s in our plans and we want to get success together.’ Ten Hag also confirmed that he has not spoken to Ronaldo since it emerged that he is pushing to leave Old Trafford. ‘I spoke with him before this issue came up I had a conversation with him, a real good talk,’ said the United manager. Ten Hag also confirmed that Harry Maguire will remain United captain for the start of the upcoming season. ‘Harry Maguire is the captain,’ said Ten Hag. ‘Of course, I have to get all the players to know all the players, that takes time but he is the established captain for years, he has achieved a lot of success so I don’t doubt this issue.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
