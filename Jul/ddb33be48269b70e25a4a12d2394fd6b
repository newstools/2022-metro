Love Island star Billy Brown has insisted Gemma Owen was ‘giving him a vibe’ during their time in Casa Amor. The bombshell landed as the girls were tempted in the fan-favourite twist of Casa Amor, and found himself drawn to Michael Owen’s daughter. While nothing happened between the pair, Gemma – who had recently dropped the L-Bomb with boyfriend Luca Bish – was accused of flirting with him, leading to a massive row in the villa. On Sunday’s Aftersun, Billy appeared as a guest – and the infamous moment was brought up again. Host Laura Whitmore asked him directly that if Luca hadn’t been on the island does he believe he would have had a chance with Gemma. To which the ever-cheeky Billy replied instantly: ‘It’s not about whether he’s there or not!’ The audience immediately burst into laughter and applause, with Billy explaining what he meant. ‘If someone gives me the vibe I’ll bounce back,’ he said. ‘She was giving me a vibe 100%.’ His insistence comes after Luca and Gemma got in a blazing row after Mad Movies aired a clip of the 19-year-old ‘flirting’ with Billy in Casa Amor. A furious Luca accused Gemma of ‘entertaining’ Billy’s flirting, which she flatly denied. At the time, Luca called Billy over to the fire pit to join them and asked straight out: ‘Did you feel like she was flirting with you?’ with him replying: ‘Yeah, it was just flirty banter.’ Fans had been shocked at Luca’s behaviour after Mad Movies, as he whispered furiously to Billy during the show: ‘I don’t even want to talk to her tonight. ‘Made me look like an absolute f*****g w****r  I ain’t going f*****g near that bird.’ Earlier in the episode, the girls had been seen calling Luca out for egging on the boys to crack on with the new bombshells during Casa Amor, while himself remaining loyal to Gemma. The pair have since made it up, and on Sunday’s episode were voted one of the most compatible couples by the public, saving them from a brutal double-dumping. Deji and Lacey, as well as Nathalia and Reece, were not so lucky: they became the latest two couples to leave the villa following Sunday’s twist. Aftersun continues next Sunday at 10pm on ITV2.
