Michael Gove has told Boris Johnson to step down as prime minister, a bombshell report has claimed. The Levelling Up Secretary is one of the most senior members of Mr Johnson’s Cabinet, but was nowhere to be seen as the PM took a battering during PMQs. According to Mail Plus, it was because he had just told him to resign during a meeting earlier this morning. A spokesman for Mr Gove did not dispute this. Mr Gove famously torpedoed Mr Johnson’s first leadership bid in 2016, before agreeing to join his Cabinet in 2019. The explosive report comes hot on the heels of six ministers resigning in one fell swoop. It’s hard to see how the PM can survive the collapse of his Government, but he told MPs today he would not resign. Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid got the ball rolling last night when they dramatically stepped down over the Chris Pincher affair. Almost 30 ministers have now resigned within 24 hours. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
