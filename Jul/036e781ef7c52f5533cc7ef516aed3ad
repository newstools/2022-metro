Liz Truss’ leadership campaign got off to an awkward start after it was announced the UK’s next prime minister would be either her or Rishi Sunak. The foreign secretary’s first tweet after the votes came in said she was ‘ready to hit the ground from day one’. People were quick to point out that she had forgotten the word ‘running’ in her use of the popular phrase. The tweet was hastily deleted and a correct version posted – but not before it was screenshot. Around 180,000 Tory members will decide which of the two candidates will lead Britain, after Conservative MPs voted out Penny Mordaunt in the final round of voting. Ms Truss was cheered by supporters holding ‘Liz for leader’ and ‘Trusted to Deliver’ placards after making it into the run-off this afternoon. The Tory politician posed for photographs in Westminster with backers – including Attorney General Suella Braverman, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng and Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey. When someone said the decision meant more hustings for Ms Truss, she quipped: ‘I can’t get enough of hustings.’ Ms Coffey also told the crowd: ‘Ladies and gentlemen, we’re in it to win it.’ Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak has told supporters in a video message: ‘I won’t let you down’. The former chancellor said: ‘I’ll work as hard as I can to get our message out to the country. ‘We need to restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite our country. ‘I’m confident that we can do that and we’ve got a really important positive message to take out to all our members now – crucially, who is the best person to beat Keir Starmer and the Labour Party at the next election? ‘I believe I’m the only candidate who can do that.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
