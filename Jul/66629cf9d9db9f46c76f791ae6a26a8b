Love Island’s Gemma Owen has another acquaintance with her in the Majorcan villa – on top of her ex-boyfriend Jacques O’Neill. Casa Amor opened its doors for business on Friday night with a fresh batch of boys, and it turns out that the -year-old international dressage rider has mutual friends with newcomer Billy Brown. Clarifying her relationship with the 23-year-old bombshell, Gemma told the girls: ‘Me and Billy have mutual friends.’ She later explained: ‘One of my best mate boy mates on the outside is his best mate.’ But Gemma made sure to warn her gal pals that Billy is a ‘bit of a player’. ‘You can tell by his personality,’ she added. Gemma’s revelation comes after eagle-eyed Love Island fans spotted that Gemma already follows Billy on social media. ‘Wait Gemma follows Billy on Instagram,’ one pointed out, while another said: ‘Okay but why is nobody talking about how Gemma knows Billy.’ Billy reckons he’s going to bring the funniness and the vibes to the villa. Explaining why he’s single at the moment, he said: ‘I’m having fun. Since I split with my girlfriend around a year ago, I just thought I won’t take it too seriously. ‘If I find someone, I find someone, if not then I’ll do my own thing. I haven’t really found that one yet I don’t think.’ If Billy was given one chance to woo a lady, he reckons he’d try and make them laugh. ‘I bounce off of what I see or what they say,’ he said. ‘I am good at reacting and just going with the flow.’ Billy is among the six new bombshells headed into Casa Amor to temp the girls, with Ronan Keating’s son also thrown into the mix. Love Island airs Monday at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
