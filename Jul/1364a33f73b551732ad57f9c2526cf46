Derek Chisora says he wants to fight Deontay Wilder next after beating Kubrat Pulev on Saturday evening. The 38-year-old ended his run of three consecutive losses with a split-decision victory over Pulev at the O2 Arena. After an entertaining fight, two judges scored the fight 116-112 and 116-114 ito Chisora, while one judge scored in 116-112 in favour of Pulev. Chisora has vowed to continue boxing, despite being urged to retire from the sport after his second defeat to Joseph Parker in December. But Chisora is now targeting a fight with Wilder, who has not fought since his defeat to Tyson Fury last October. Speaking immediately after the fight, Chisora told DAZN: ‘I told Eddie, the other day, if he can get me the Bronze Bomber, I’ll be happy. ‘I want to fight everybody in my era, win or lose, I just want to fight.’ Speaking to iFL TV, Chisora said: ‘Yeah, I’d take the Bronze Bomber. ‘If he’s itching… the Bronze Bomber, give me some of that power, baby.’ Meanwhile, Eddie Hearn has described Wilder as a ‘dangerous fight’ for Chisora. ‘You’ve got to pick wisely for Derek Chisora,’ Hearn told Pro Boxing Fans. ‘People talk about the Deontay Wilder fight, I appreciate that’s a very, very dangerous fight. ‘I think can win, but it’s also a very dangerous fight and he punches hard.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
