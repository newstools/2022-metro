A woman stunned fellow bus passengers by urinating on board because the driver refused to stop. The woman and her friends are now wanted by police for causing £700 worth of damage and hurling abuse at passengers. The trio were travelling from Bournemouth to Ringwood in Hampshire on a double-decker bus. When the bus driver refused to stop the bus for the woman to get off and go to the toilet she decided to go where she was. While the woman was urinating, her male friend allegedly shouted at passengers and kicked the door and windscreen of the bus. Because of the disruption, all passengers were forced to leave the bus at the town of Verwood on the edge of the New Forest. The woman who urinated allegedly went on to assault two young women. Kate Hann, a community support investigator at Dorset Police, said: ‘We are carrying out enquiries into this incident and I am keen to hear from anyone who recognises the three people in the CCTV images. ‘I would also like to speak to the two young women, or possibly teenage girls, who say they were assaulted by the woman on the bus at the bus stop in Verwood to come forward so we can take their account of what happened. ‘The cost of the damage is £700 and the actions of this group forced the passengers to abandon their journey and get off the bus. ‘I am keen to identify the three people in these images and am urging anyone who has information that might assist our investigation to please come forward.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
