London Pride is a protest. It’s a celebration. It’s also a time when LGBTQ+ people have an excuse to wear their most brilliant outfits, get seriously creative with makeup, and show up in style. More than 1,000,000 people turned up to this year’s event, so we’re not going to even attempt to share every single brilliant style moment we spotted from the day. But once you’re done enjoying all the dog pics and fancy getting some style inspiration from London’s best and brightest, you can check out a handful of some glorious fashion and beauty moments ahead. Expect lots of sparkle, lots of drama, and a more-is-more colour palette. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
