A man has been shot dead after he reportedly killed five members of his family he had been holding hostage since last night. The attack happened in Douvres, a town in eastern France. Local media reported the man in his twenties killed his father, his stepmother and three siblings. The man had been entrenched in a house with his family since around 11.30pm yesterday, according to reports. Le Progres said that the victims were his father, who ran a building company in Ain, his stepmother, originally from Gironde, his 17 -year-old sister, his half brother, 15, and his half-sister, aged five. Police were on site this morning and the attacker was shot by the GIGN (National Gendarmerie Intervention Group) before noon. The house is sealed off as part of an investigation. Photos from the scene show emergency services guarding the area, with officers looking around to try gather evidence. The village was shocked by the crime, with local bar and pizzeria La Babilliere saying they would temporarily close ‘due to the events’. Its manager, named Tania, told Le Progres that many people has been phoning to try and find out what was happening ‘but we don’t know’. She added: ‘The gendarmes just told me not to open for my safety.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
