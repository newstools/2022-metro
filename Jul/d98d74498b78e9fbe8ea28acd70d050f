Love Island fans saw Paige Thorne move on from Jacques O’Neill as she shared her first kiss with bombshell Adam Collard tonight. The pair have been enjoying getting to know each other in recent days, amid Jacques’ decision to leave the villa last weekend. Tonight, they stepped things up a gear as Adam leaned in for a kiss, which Paige reciprocated, in sweet scenes. Adam teased Paige that he ‘didn’t know’ where he stood, leading to her saying he was in with a ‘60% chance’ of romance. But after the Geordie decided to pull her in for a smooch, she admitted that was now ‘maybe at 70%’. Who would have thought it? It comes after Paige’s former love interest, Jacques, decided to walk from the villa. When quizzed on Sunday night’s After Sun how he felt to see Paige moving on, Jacques seemed surprisingly calm. He reminded viewers he’d told her to ‘crack on’ after breaking the news he would be leaving just like he did ‘in Casa Amor.’ Fans reacted to the kiss after the pair seemed to be the only ones who managed to avoid drama tonight. One wrote on Twitter: ‘We are living in a world where ADAM F***ING COLLARD is the most respectful boy on love island #LoveIsland.’ Another shared: ‘Adam f***ing Collard is gonna win Love Island this year at this rate, biggest plot twist of 2022 #LoveIsland.’ ‘Two weeks from the finale and the only solid couple we’ve got is Adam & Paige x #loveisland,’ a fan weighed in. Someone else commented: ‘Paige and Adam came from nowhere and are about to win this money😭😭 #LoveISland.’ But could the pair really end up going all the way? Love Island continues tomorrow night at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
