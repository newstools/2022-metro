The cost of a single tub of Lurpak butter has soared to eye-watering £7.20 amid inflation. Chicken has also seen a huge hike price. A pack of 1kg chicken breasts from Sainsbury’s now costs £6.02 – up £1.18 from £4.84. Earlier today, the Bank of England told lenders to prepare for ‘deteriorated economic outlook’. It also predicted that increases in house prices would slow down later this year. ‘The economic outlook for the UK and globally has deteriorated materially,’ the Bank said as it published its latest Financial Stability Report.
