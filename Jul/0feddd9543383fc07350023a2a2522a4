A teenager has been charged with preparing a bomb to carry out a terror attack. Vaughn Conrad John Dolphin was arrested last week on suspicion of possession of explosives and other terrorism offences. He is also accused of having copies of manuals detailing how to make improvised explosives and firearms. The 19-year-old was detained in Cheshire by West Midlands Police Officers. Mr Dolphin, from Walsall, is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court tomorrow. A police spokesperson said: ‘Vaughn Conrad John Dolphin, from Aldridge in Walsall, was arrested on the night of 27 June at an address in Cheshire on suspicion of terror offences. ‘Today he was charged with eight counts under the Terrorism Act and two under the Explosive Substances Act. ‘It’s alleged the 19-year-old was in possession of quantities of explosive substances contrary to section 4 (1) of the Explosive Substances Act 1883. ‘He’s also charged with two counts of sharing online material that could encourage the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, contrary to section 2(1)(d) of the Terrorism Act 2006. ‘And the teenager faces six counts of possessing documents of a kind likely to be useful to a someone committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to section 58(1)(b) of the Terrorism Act 2000.’ In February, the security services lowered their assessment of the threat posed by terrorism to ‘substantial’ from ‘severe’, meaning that they judge a future attack to be likely but not highly likely.
