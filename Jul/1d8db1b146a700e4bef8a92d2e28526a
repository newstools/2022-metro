Human remains have been found in a burnt out mill in Oldham during a search for four people who were missing after a fire. The fire was extinguished over four days in May, but at the time it was believed nobody had been inside. On Thursday, police received a report that four Vietnamese nationals were missing and may have been involved in the fire. Greater Manchester Police have now declared a major incident after demolition workers found the remains at Bismark House Mill on Bower Street yesterday. GMP Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts said today: ‘Victims and the bereaved are at the forefront of our investigations into deaths. As such, whilst work is ongoing to confirm the identity of the deceased, we are liaising with partner agencies to ensure potential family members in Vietnam are fully informed and supported. ‘This news will understandably impact both the local and wider community. I can reassure members of the public that this has been declared a major incident to ensure both GMP and partner agencies respond to this incident in the most effective way. ‘Also, that specialist officers are following every line of enquiry to confirm the identity of the deceased, if anyone else was inside the mill during the fire, and the full circumstances surrounding that fire. ‘Any criminal offences identified as part of their investigation will be immediately and appropriately progressed.‘On behalf of the investigation team, I appeal to anyone with information to contact them directly or, anonymously, via Crimestoppers. ‘They’re particularly interested in hearing from anyone who knows how the building was being used in the lead up to May 7 or who has information about the fire itself.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
