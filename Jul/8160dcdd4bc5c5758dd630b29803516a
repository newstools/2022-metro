Rafael Nadal apologised for his conduct after he after defeating Lorenzo Sonego in straight sets to reach the fourth round of Wimbledon. Nadal cruised through the first two sets 6-1, 6-2, but was given a run for his money in the third which ended 6-4, with the 22-time grand slam winner growing frustrated with his opponent. The Spaniard called over Sonego in the last few games to call out what he perceived to be a unsportsmanlike behaviour, much to the Italian’s annoyance and confusion. Asked about what he said to Sonego, Nadal said after the match: ‘Not spicy at all, I just from the bottom of my heart I didn’t make it in a negative way. ‘I feel sorry if I bothered him but I did it in a right way. I feel really bad now if I bothered him so I feel sorry for that. That’s it, I will talk to him after but this is not a problem. ‘Probably been my best match here without a doubt during the Championships, against the most difficult player I faced. I have been able to raise my level, super happy for that and wishing Lorenzo Sonego the best for the season he is a great player on grass I think he has a great future here. The 36-year-old was also asked about how his fitness was and replied: ‘It’s always a tricky thing. ‘I went through some tough injuries in my career but in some way I feel very lucky that I am still able to play at my age. I never thought that would happen 10 years ago so I feel lucky so thanks to everyone who has supported to me in this journey.’ Nadal will face Van de Zandschulp in the fourth round.
