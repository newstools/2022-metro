A £270,000 Lamborghini Aventador has been seized after its owner was suspected of driving while uninsured. Police stopped the eye-catching supercar on the streets of central Milton Keynes on Saturday. Officers cruising by had noticed the vehicle, which hit speeds of 217mph, was without a number plate on its front bonnet. After pulling the motorist over, they also realised he was driving without insurance. Police tweeted: ‘Police spotted this beautiful Lamborghini Aventador driving in CMK without a front number plate. ‘Enquiries showed the driver could not prove he had insurance. Therefore the vehicle was seized and driver reported.’ Pictures of the car, including ones of it being loaded on to a tow truck, were also posted to the force’s Twitter account. It’s not the only Lamborghini taken off the streets this weekend. In Manchester, officers seized a bright green supercar on Saturday. It was being driven in an antisocial manner and, when stopped, warnings from police fell on deaf ears. Greater Manchester Police tweeted: ‘This Lamborghini had been sighted being driven in a anti social manner earlier this evening on Wilmslow Road, having been warned under S59, the driver then continued to drive in such manner! ‘Car seized and he’s been reported for driving without due care and attention.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
