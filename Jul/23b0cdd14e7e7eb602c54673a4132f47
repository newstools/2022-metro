People have mocked an e-fit of a man with facial tattoos who police want to speak to about the assault of a pensioner. Avon and Somerset Police shared an appeal online about an offender aged in his late 20s after an aggravated burglary in the village of Congresbury. What caught attention was not the details of the horrifying incident, but how bizarre the computer-generated image is. Constabularies often post e-fits of people they wish to speak to regarding crimes but some of them have left a little to be desired on the artistic side. ‘This is quite the e-fit of nightmares,’ one commenter wrote under the appeal. ‘Like they have taken his year-7 school photo and aged it with a felt tip pen…’ Another said: ‘Are those tattoos or did he not clean his face after having it pained as a leopard at the tea party the day before?’ ‘When caught I would love to see mugshot to compare,’ a man commented. Police in Somerset insist this one matches the description of a man connected to the incident, which happened around 1am on May 5 at a home on Chestnut Close. The offender broke into the pensioner’s home, before hitting him across the face twice, causing significant injuries. He then stole two golden chains the victim was wearing, including one necklace with a thick golden cross with diamonds. The pensioner, who is in his 70s, described the man as around 5ft 6-8ins, white, of slim build, with brown medium wavy hair. At the time, he was wearing a dark blue sweatshirt with a hooded coat and had tattoos on his face. He also had a chain tattoo around his neck.
