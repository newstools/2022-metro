Japan is dealing with a heatwave on an unprecedented scale. In the east of the country, temperatures hit 35°C for the seventh day running, while the western city of Nagoya was predicted to hit 40°C. They are the hottest temperatures to hit the country since records began in 1875, prompting the government to issue warnings. They warned energy supplies will remain tight amid rising energy prices, with calls to restart some nuclear reactors which have been switched off since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. It also told residents to relax mask wearing rules, a controversial issue for residents who wore face masks even before the pandemic. Deputy chief cabinet secretary Seiji Kihara told a news conference: ‘Since it raises the risk of heatstroke, please take off your masks outside if you are far away from others and not speaking.’ Residents have also been told to cut power as much as possible, while manufacturers shortened working hours. A few commuter train stations were shut off and an amusement park near Yokohama was closed to save energy. On Thursday, the power grid for 37 million residents in Tokyo crept close to usage levels that threatened outages – but the situation has now been eased. An official at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) told reporters on Thursday: ‘Due to the record high temperatures, we had (power) demand nearly equal to summer peak levels in June – before we were able to gather sufficient supply resources. That’s why things got tight.’It is not the first time Japan has experienced higher temperatures than expected with several events at the Tokyo Olympics being rescheduled last year. Cooler temperatures and rain are expected to bring welcome relief after another sizzling weekend. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
