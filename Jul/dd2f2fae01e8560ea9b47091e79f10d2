And with temperatures rising into the high 30s (and even 40s in some places) this week, it’s going to get even warmer, stuffier, and sweatier. Because most of our homes here in the UK are designed to retain heat – and because we rarely experience such hot weather, so aren’t exactly prepared – we feel it more than we would in more temperate climates. It doesn’t exactly make sense to have your home fitted with an integrated air conditioner when the forecast is normally ‘drizzle and cloud’. But there are a number of cost-effective ways to beat the worst effects of the heatwave. With Prime Day underway, Amazon is offering big discounts on all sorts of products for a limited time.
