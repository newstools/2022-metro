A British man has been found dead on a sunbed on the Greek island of Crete. Fellow sunbathers on the popular Stalida beach are understood to have become concerned about the man after they noticed he had not moved from the sun lounger ‘for hours’. When they approached the 54-year-old they realised he was unconscious and raised the alarm. Paramedics rushed to the beach at around 8pm on Saturday where they found people desperately trying to revive the man by performing CPR. The man was taken to Heraklion University Hospital but later pronounced dead, MailOnline reports. The man is understood to have remained in the sun without a break for several hours when fellow beachgoers decided to check on him. The man’s identity has not yet been revealed, and his body is scheduled to undergo a post-mortem examination to determine the cause of his death. A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: ‘We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Crete’.
