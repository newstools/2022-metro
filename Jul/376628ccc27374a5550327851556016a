A teenager was filmed fighting with a 34-year-old alleged love rival in broad daylight. A smartphone video showed the pair trading blows in Morley, Leeds, as temperatures soared this week. At first, the 18-year-old woman dressed in blue was arguing with the older person in red in an apparent dispute over a man. But the feud escalated quickly, with the pair trading punches while bystanders looked on. The two women continued the brawl, moving across the street with no one stepping in to stop the fight. The clip then cut to the two rivals fighting back on the other side of the street, but at this point, several other women had got involved and it had turned into a mass brawl. The two women were eventually split up, and they went their separate ways. It is understood police were not called to the incident. Metro.co.uk has contacted Yorkshire Police for comment. Earlier this month, two women got into a nasty brawl in front of horrified shoppers at Primark’s flagship Birmingham store. Footage shows the pair rolling around the floor and swapping blows after the fight broke out on July 9. The woman in the black top pinned her opponent to the ground and repeatedly said: ‘Let go, and I’ll let go of you’. She was later heard verbally abusing the woman while her friends laughed in the background. It is still not clear how the fight started, but police have said the incident was dealt with by security.
