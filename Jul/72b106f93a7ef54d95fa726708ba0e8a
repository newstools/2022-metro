If you had been relying on scooping yesterday’s EuroMillions jackpot before paying off the expensive koi carp pond in your new mega-mansion, we have some bad news. Nobody picked all the winning numbers, and the record prize has now rolled over to the draw on Tuesday. If you had won last week, you could have taken home £195 million – even more than the headline figure of £191 million. This is because the draw amount is actually set in Euros, and has reached the maximum of €230 million. That figure won’t change, but due to the fluctuating exchange rate, the amount you win in pounds will change based on the currency conversion. EuroMillions have assured us, however, that although the prize could end u being more than £191 million, it definitely won’t be any less. So you’d probably take that – especially as lottery winnings in the UK are tax free. The jackpot has now rolled over four times, meaning nobody has won the top prize in over a fortnight. That may not be that surprising, as the odds are one in 139,838,160 – i.e. extremely low. But eventually somebody will claim it, and if they are from the UK it will result in the country’s biggest-ever EuroMillions win. They would be able to buy 11 Boeing 747 jets, 23 Pisces-VI Submarines, or Southampton Football Club. As the prize has reached its cap, money that would have been added to the jackpot will boost winnings in the next tier, meaning several multi-millionaires could be created. Andy Carter, senior winners’ adviser at the National Lottery, said: ‘Tuesday will be massive with a sizzlingly sensational estimated EuroMillions jackpot of £191 million up for grabs. ‘Here’s hoping that we’ll be celebrating a record-breaking UK winner alongside record-breaking summer temperatures.’ The winning main EuroMillions numbers were 09, 17, 29, 38, 39, with the lucky star numbers 07 and 10. Friday night’s 14 biggest winners across all countries claimed almost £1.5 million each, while a further 14 took home £20,000. The winning Thunderball numbers were 01, 08, 27, 31, 34 – plus the Thunderball 03. Nobody matched all the numbers to scoop the top prize of £500,000, however, four people won £5,000 after choosing the five main numbers.
