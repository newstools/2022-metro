An actress who once starred in EastEnders has reportedly been arrested on suspicion of fraud. The woman, who has not been named, is said to be a household name on British television and best known for playing a main character on the BBC One soap. Police officers from the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (Ersou) reportedly arrested the actress at an east London address on Friday during an early morning raid. She was taken to Gravesend police station in Kent while in custody, and questioned before being released later that day pending further investigation. Details of the alleged fraud conspiracy have not been released but it’s claimed documents and electronic devices were removed from the property during the raid. A source described the fraud allegations as ‘large-scale’ and added to The Sun that the actress ‘would have been taken completely by surprise’ due to the early morning raid. Ersou confirmed the arrest to the publication and said the investigation was ongoing. The police unit was created in 2010 and is dedicated to tackling serious organised crime and the terrorism threat across the eastern region. It also has a dedicated economic crime team which tackles offences such as fraud and money laundering, as well as enforcing the latest Proceeds of Crime Act legislation.
