A premiership rugby club has changed the name of the bars at its stadium over ‘racism’ claims. For years, Exeter Chiefs have been facing mounting criticism over the continued association with Native Americans and their branding. Critics have previously denounced the team, claiming the name evokes ‘Britain’s forgotten imperial American past’. An American Indian rights organisation even called on them to drop their name and stop fans wearing traditional headdresses in November 2021. After reviewing their branding, the club said it will use imagery from the Celtic Iron Age Dumnonii Tribe earlier this year. In a further move away from the Native American Theme, the bars at the Sandy Park stadium have now been named after castles in Devon. The former Wigwam Bar is now called the Woodbury Castle Bar, and the Pow Wow Bar is the Powderham Castle Bar. Other changes include the Tomahawk Bar becoming the Dartmouth Castle and the Buffalo and Bison changing to the Castle Drogo and the Haldon Belvedere. The Cheyenne Bar is now the Compton Castle and the Campfire Grill is now the Totnes Castle. A statement from the club said: ‘With our roots deeply entrenched here in Devon, we are using our new Exeter Chiefs rebrand as the perfect opportunity to rename our bars and catering outlets here at Sandy Park after some of the magnificent castles within the region. ‘Castles represent the history, grandeur, and pride we feel about Devon, and we wanted to transmit this on our award-winning match days.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
