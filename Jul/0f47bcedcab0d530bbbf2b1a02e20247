The Queen braved the heatwave sun to make a surprise visit to a hospice with the Princess Royal to open its new centre today. The monarch travelled the short distance from her Windsor Castle home to Maidenhead – just under five miles – to tour the Thames Hospice to meet staff, volunteers and a patient. For more than 30 years the hospice has been providing palliative and end-of-life care and support to people across East Berkshire and South Buckinghamshire. Its services are free for those who need care, and more than 50% of the £13 million annual running costs come from charitable support. On Tuesday, the Queen celebrated the achievements of the NHS across the decades by awarding the institution the George Cross during a ceremony she hosted at Windsor. The 96-year-old head of state was joined by the Prince of Wales for event where health leaders from the four home nations were each awarded the medal.
