With reports that Ed Sheeran and Cherry Seaborn have called their second child Jupiter, we’re calling it: planetary and astrological baby names are set to be a fully-fledged trend. Ed and Cherry are not the first celebs to take inspiration from the solar system for their offspring’s monikers. Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost gave their baby the name Cosmo (like the cosmos, get it?), Chrissy Teigen and John Legend have a daughter called Luna (the Roman goddess of the Moon), and Ashley Tisdale also has a little Jupiter. You could dismiss these as just off-centre celeb choices, but the celestial name trend is starting to trickle down to us normals. Luna jumped up from number 11 in the girls’ baby name rankings to slot two for this year, Mars has risen by 300% since 2013, while searches for baby names such as Saturn and Comet are on the up in the past few weeks. All this means that if you want to get ahead of the curve, you might want to look to astrology and astronomy for your kiddo’s name. We’ve listed some ideas below, excluding certain planets, moons, and star signs that don’t quite work for baby names (Uranus and Cancer, we’re looking at you). Do you have a story to share?
