N’Golo Kante will reject a move to Arsenal to remain at Chelsea this summer, according to former Blues right-back Glenn Johnson. Arsenal are considering a surprise move for Chelsea midfielder Kante, according to reports. The World Cup winner has just a year left on his current contract with Chelsea and reports have claimed that Thomas Tuchel’s side could decide to cash in this summer. Chelsea are considering a move for Real Betis midfielder Guido Rodriguez as they weigh up possible replacements for the 31-year-old Frenchman. ‘Any team would want N’Golo Kante,’ Johnson told BettingOdds.com. ‘We all know what he does and what he’s going to do because he delivers every time he plays. ‘I can’t see Chelsea letting him go to Arsenal to be honest. Arsenal are nowhere near a threat to Chelsea, so I can’t see N’Golo wanting to go there just yet. ‘He’s got plenty more in the tank.’ Kante has not travelled with Chelsea’s squad for their pre-season tour of the United States and started just 21 Premier League games last season as his campaign was hampered by injuries. He has made 260 appearances for Chelsea across all competitions since his move from Leicester City in 2016. During his time at Stamford Bridge, Kante has won the Premier League, Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup. He was named Premier League Player of the Season for 2016-17 and in the following campaign he was crowned Chelsea’s Player of the Year. According to reports, Chelsea, who finished third in the Premier League last season, view Argentina international Rodriguez as a possible long-term replacement for Kante. The Blues are also close to signing Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly in a €40million (£33.8m) deal.
