While speaking about mental health has become more normalised, the reality of accepting it still has a long way to go. It seems one of the most taboo settings to accept mental health issues is in the workplace – which is tragic, considering it’s where most of us spend the majority of our time. A recent mental health index report by LifeWorks’ found that 91% of Brits believe people with mental health conditions are treated differently at work. Digging into the specifics, around a third struggling with mental health wouldn’t talk to colleagues or a boss about it, even though around the same number of people cite work as their primary source of stress. This is especially concerning considering the general mental health of those surveyed has declined this year. But it makes logical sense that this might be the case, as many employees will be working the same hours on the same wage – despite the cost of living crisis and inflation. In fact, work stress is currently affecting the sleep of 29% of people, and is to blame for greater emotional changes for 24% of individuals. Those who feel comfortable speaking about their mental health generally have better psychological health, the data shows, highlighting just how much influence a working environment can have on individual employee health.
