For legal reasons, the player – who is a full international – cannot be named and he is currently in police custody being questioned over the alleged attack which took place last month. The Metropolitan Police said in a statement: ‘On July 4, an allegation of rape of a woman in her 20s was reported to police. ‘It was reported the alleged rape happened in June 2022.’ The police added that the man ‘was arrested at an address in Barnet on suspicion of rape and taken into custody where he remains. ‘Enquiries into the circumstances are ongoing.’ A further statement from the police confirmed that the Premier League footballer in question – who was taken into custody in the early hours of Monday morning – is 29 years old.
