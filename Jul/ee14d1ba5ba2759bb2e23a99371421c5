Stacey Solomon’s wedding to Joe Swash is fast approaching and the prep is well underway – which includes a hair transformation for the bride, of course. The Loose Women star is set to marry the former EastEnders actor at their £1.2million Essex mansion, affectionally dubbed Pickle Cottage. After meeting back in their I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! days, Joe popped the question over Christmas 2020, but their big day has been postponed several times, both due to the pandemic and Stacey’s pregnancy. But now daughter Rose is here, the adorable couple can walk down the aisle, and that could be happening any day now. The former X Factor star has been keeping her followers in the loop with all her preparation, offering fans a glimpse into everything, from her hen party in Mykonos to the creation of the stunning decorations scattered around her home. Stacey has been enjoying life as as bold redhead for a while now, but decided to go for something more tame for her special day, revealing her new blonde locks to her Instagram followers on Friday night. She shared three gorgeous selfies, all showing a beaming smile on her face – as well as the sparkling engagement ring on her finger. Stacey’s new warm-toned hair resembles her natural colour, but she shared that it was certainly a process achieving it. Writing in her caption, she said she now feels like ‘me’ again, which is exactly what she hoped for ahead of becoming Mrs Swash. ‘It feels so so lovely to be blonde again 🥲 For some reason I just wanted to be back to me and my (not so natural but natural 😂) for our special day,’ she penned. ‘As much as I love changing to fun bright colours I didn’t want anything crazy for the wedding and just want to feel as me as possible 😂 I love it so much. It was a process but it was sooo WORTH IT 😉 Happy Friyay everyone. Not long to go!’ Her 5.5million followers went all heart eyes over the transformation, showering her with compliments in the comments. Famous friends and TV colleagues such as Katie Piper also had plenty of lovely things to say, with the author writing: ‘Really suits you 😍’. ‘Absolutely gorgeous girlie ❤️’, added Mrs Hinch, while a stunned Vicky Pattison commented: ‘Wow 😍’. Upon unveiling her new hair colour, Stacey also shared the ‘exciting’ news that she has partnered with L’Oreal and become an ambassador for the brand, after they watched her use their colour kits over the years. The loveable TV star said it took four days to transform her ‘do from red to blonde, with her friend of six years and professional hairdresser lending a hand. ‘I honestly love it so so much, it’s so soft and pretty’, Stacey wrote on her Insta Story.
