This is the smiling last selfie taken by a young mountaineer who died moments later when the collapse of a glacier triggered an avalanche in Italy. Tributes have been paid to dad Filippo Bari, 27, who was one of seven people killed and eight injured on 10,968 feet mountain Marmolada. He messaged his family with the image, saying ‘look where I am’ on Sunday. But tragedy soon struck and brother, Andrea, and parents, Emanuela and Giuseppe didn’t hear from him again. Filippo is seen wearing a climbing helmet and sunglasses as he poses with a big grin behind the mountain slope. He was a passionate climber and had been visiting the highest mountain in the Dolomites mountain range on a trip with friends. The hardware store worker, who lived in Malo with partner Jelena and son Filippo, 4, was planning on taking on Monte Rosa this week. Andrea Bari said of his brother: ‘Filippo was a great lover of the mountains and nature in general. ‘He had already done several high-altitude outings, always accompanied by experienced people and with all the necessary equipment.’ Up to five people are still missing following the ice, snow and rock slide, with hope of finding survivors fading nearly three days after the disaster. Authorities said today conditions in the Italian Alps are too unstable for search teams and dogs to work on the mountain. It’s predicted temperatures may dip on Thursday, lessening the risk of more avalanches. Trento prosecutor Sandro Raimondi said in an interview on Italian state radio on Wednesday that he has opened a formal investigation to determine if any negligence was involved. It appears at this point the avalanche could not have been anticipated, he said. Mr Raimondi added: ‘The unpredictability in this moment is the chief protagonist.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
