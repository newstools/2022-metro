A black family is suing Sesame Place for $25 million over claims of racial discrimination, alleging a costumed character at the amusement park ignored children because of their race. The lawsuit comes after a video that went viral on social media showed a performer dressed as Rosita seeming to ignore two young black girls during a meet and greet event. The performer, donning a full character suit, can be seen in the video walking down the street during a parade, giving high-fives to the children who approach. As the two young black girls reach out for their own high-fives, the Rosita performed appeared to wave them away before continuing down the parade. The family involved in the lawsuit is separate from the family who shared the video online. Four employees are named in the civil suit and alleged to have ignored Quinton Burns, his daughter Kennedi Burns and other black guests during the meet and greet. The lawsuit was filed in a Philadelphia federal court against SeaWorld Parks, the owner of Sesame Place. It claims the park’s ‘performers readily engaged with numerous similarly situated white customers’ while allowing ‘pervasive and appalling race discrimination’ to take place. Performers dressed as classic Sesame Street characters ‘Elmo,’ ‘Ernie,’ ‘Telly Monster,’ and ‘Abby Cadabby’ all refused to engage with the Burns family and ignored all other black guests in the park, the lawsuit claims. The Sesame Place park has issued several apology statements, the first explaining the character had difficulty seeing in the costume and had been gesturing ‘no’ to a parent who was asking them to hold a child for a photo, which isn’t allowed. In a separate statement, Sesame Place says they will review the lawsuit and ‘are committed to deliver an inclusive, equitable and entertaining experience for all our guests.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
