Noah Schnapp has played down his Doja Cat drama after he shared DMs she sent him about co-star Joseph Quinn. The 17-year-old Stranger Things star – who plays Will Byers in the hit Netflix show – was blasted by the 26-year-old singer after sharing their private messages in which she asked him to set her up with the Eddie Munson actor. He has since taken to TikTok to reveal he apologised and cleared the air, insisting there was ‘no hard feelings’. Now, he has explained to Variety: ‘Yeah, I mean, look, I’m super unserious on social media and pretty goofy, so I posted that not thinking too much of it, but obviously it hurt her feelings. ‘So, as I should, I apologised and she was totally okay with it, and was like, “I’m sorry how I reacted.” It was all good. I love her. I’m like the biggest fan of her music, and I told her that. I was like, you’re literally my role model. ‘It’s all good. People make such a big deal out of everything when it’s on the internet, but, like, in reality, it’s like a two minute thing.’ The Need To Know star had initially messaged him: ‘Noah can you tell Joseph to hit me up,’ before adding: ‘Wait no. does he have a gf [girlfriend]?’ Noah then replied: ‘LMAOO slide into his dms,’ to which Doja wrote: ‘idk [I don’t know] his IG or Twitter. Doesn’t have a DM to slide in,’ before Noah sent her his page. He then shared the messages on TikTok, which led to Doja calling him out for posting them without her agreement. Things were a bit awkward after she called him out publicly, even referring to his actions as ‘borderline snake s**t’. She lost over 200,000 followers after telling her Instagram followers: ‘I think that, to be fair, first let’s be chill about it. Like Noah is a kid, but, I don’t even know how old he is, but he’s not even over – like there’s no way he’s over 21. ‘But when you’re that young, you make mistakes. You do dumb st. I’m like trying to be super fair. You do dumb s**t, you say dumb s**t, you f**king f**k up relationships with people. You make mistakes.’ She added: ‘The fact that Noah did that, like went and posted a private conversation between me and him is so unbelievably socially unaware and whack. ‘That’s like borderline snake s**t, that’s like weasel s**t. And I’m not saying that encapsulates his entire personality – like I don’t imagine Noah that way.’ However, Noah later reassured fans that they had sorted things out, as he shared a new TikTok video of him doing quick maths using a filter, set to Doja’s song Kiss Me More. He added: ‘Guys everything is all good I apologised and I still follow her and love her music no hard feelings.’ Got a story?
