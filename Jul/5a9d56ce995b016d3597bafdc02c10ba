A funeral boss has been arrested after four bodies ‘in a state of decomposition’ were found in a self-storage unit. The 50-year-old man was detained after police were called to premises in Water Road, Wembley, at around 9.30am last Friday. The Met said four bodies were recovered at the location, which did not have specialist equipment installed. An industry source told the Mirror the deceased were ‘maggot-ridden’ after being kept in non-refrigerated conditions in hot weather. Police said all of the deceased were elderly and the deaths are not being treated as suspicious. They added urgent enquiries were conducted to establish the identity of the deceased and to notify affected families. Enquiries are also ongoing to establish the full circumstances of the incident, led by detectives from Specialist Crime. The arrested man has been bailed to a date in early August. Detective Superintendent Barry Loader of the Met’s North West BCU said: ‘I know these will be concerning developments for local people, and in particular those directly affected by what has happened. ‘Through the hard work and commitment of colleagues from Specialist Crime, all of the deceased have been identified, their families have been informed and subsequently the bodies returned to the families following consultation with HM Coroner. ‘The Met has provided dedicated family liaison officers to those affected. I would encourage anyone with concerns to speak with their local Safer Neigbourhoods officers or to call the Met on 101.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
