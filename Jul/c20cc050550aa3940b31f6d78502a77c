Portugal’s tropical archipelago is getting two new travel routes, making its incredible islands more accessible than ever before. These volcanic islands are filled with natural wonders from hot springs to bird-watching sanctuaries, plus lush vineyards and charming seaside villages. And for more active adventurers, the islands boast the perfect conditions for diving, hiking and even fossil hunting. Here are our top picks of the Azorean islands to visit – and why. Nicknamed the black island, this is home to (what else?) an ancient volcano, Ponta do Pico, which at 2,351m is Portugal’s highest mountain. Known for its wine, vines run along the ground on top of small black rocks. This is the place to come if you like diving. There are sites along its coast, including a shipwrecked freighter. For reef diving, meanwhile, head to the north-east coast, where Ferreiro de Fora offers colourful fish and coral. Long and narrow, this island is only four miles across at its widest point. It’s famous for its fajãs – coastal plateaus home to the island’s smaller villages – and is networked with hiking trails through these. This island has the largest marine fossil deposits in the northern hemisphere, from molluscs to cetaceans. You’ll also find basaltic formations and columns similar to the Giant’s Causeway. The least-visited and smallest island of the Azores has a population of about 400 but it’s best known for birdwatching. You’ll see herons, snipes, woodcocks and northern wheatears.
