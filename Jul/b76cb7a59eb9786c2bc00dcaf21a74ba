A 14-year-old girl has died in a horror incident at a theme park in Denmark, police said. Tragedy struck this afternoon when the rear part of a 82ft-tall rollercoaster in the Tivoli Friheden park in the city of Aarhus came off the rails. ‘The rear two seats’ of the ‘Cobra’ ride were hanging ‘under the wagon train’, manager Henrik Ragborg Olsen told local media. Police were called to the scene at 12.50pm local time after several people got stuck in the ride but it is still unclear what went wrong. Three people were immediately rushed to hospital, with the girl confirmed dead shortly after. A 13-year-old boy has also sustained injuries to one hand in the accident and his parents have been informed, police say. The seriousness of their injuries is still unknown. After the incident, all guests were evacuated and the park was closed for the rest of the day, police added. A statement on the Tivoli Friheden Facebook page read: ‘The accident happened while the track was in operation and the rear wagon broke off. ‘There are two people injured. Their condition is currently unknown. ‘The park was immediately evacuated to visitors and will remain closed until further notice. ‘We have gathered the guests who are related to the injured – and those who sat on the train – and are offering psychological help to those who need it. ‘The cause of the accident has not yet been determined, but technical assistance from experts has been requested. ‘Out of respect for the injured, we encourage our guests not to share any pictures that may have been taken in connection with the accident.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
