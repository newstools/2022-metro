Prince George looked less than impressed as Nicholas Kyrgios swore and yelled during the Wimbledon final. The tennis player lashed out at the umpire over someone in the crowd for distracting him as he took on Novak Djokovic. Kyrgios, who is competing in his first ever Wimbledon final, lost his cool during the fifth game of the third set when a woman could be heard heckling him. But George – clearly being raised to be a proper English gentleman – looked disdainfully at the finalist during his rant. The incident occurred during the fifth game of the third set with the scores at deuce, when a woman could be heard heckling Kyrgios as he attempted a serve. The Australian turned to the umpire and said: ‘Distracting me when I’m serving in a Wimbledon final? There’s no bigger occasion. ‘You didn’t believe me [the first time] and now it’s happened again. It almost cost me the game. Why is she still here? ‘She’s drunk out of her mind in the first row speaking to me in the middle of a game. How is that acceptable? ‘Kick her out. I know exactly who it is. It’s the one with the dress… the one who looks like she has had about 700 drinks bro.’ As well as being subjected to a barrage of bad language, George also sat in the scorching 28°C in a navy blue suit. The future king appeared too shy to answer when questioned on who he was supporting between Djokovic and Kyrgios. His dad Prince William whispered: ‘Djokovic’, but then joked: ‘We’ll see how long it lasts. He’ll support the winner.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
