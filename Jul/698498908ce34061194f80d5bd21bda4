The world of property really is a fascinating place. What you can get for one sum of money somewhere, is a totally different kettle of fish in another area. For example, just under £1million would get you a rather lovely and spacious home in many parts of the country – even two houses in some spots. But in London, it seems this price will get the likes of this derelict five-bed terraced house – which is currently on the market. The property up for sale in Lower Clapton Street, East London, is in desperate need of repair. So while the asking price is £950,000 – buyers will need to sink a whole lot more into renovating the property. That’s because currently there are holes in the ceiling, there’s plaster missing, wallpaper hanging off the walls and gaps in the floorboards – amongst other issues. However, those willing to put the work (and money) in will get 2631 sq ft to play with – including five bedrooms, two reception rooms, a kitchen and two rooms on the lower ground floor. The listing stresses that the property is in need of modernisation, but there is potential for an extension – subject to certain consents. There’s also a decent-sized rear garden. And, in terms of location, the house is a stone’s throw from Clapton station – plus Hackney Downs Park, Millfields Park and Hackney Marshes are all easily accessible. Anyone looking to take the house on can bid at auction for the property – which is taking place on July 19 with Savills. Do you have a story to share?
