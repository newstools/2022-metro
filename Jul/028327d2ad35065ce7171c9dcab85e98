We all know how traffic jams on motorways can be a nightmare. But a bunch of drivers were treated to the soothing sounds of a brass band who decided to play some music after a lorry caught fire, halting all traffic. They were filmed getting into the groove, clapping their hands and busting some moves on the M6 near Preston on Friday. Some motorists even played table football and organised parties in the middle of the usually busy three-lane motorway. The massive blaze caused huge tailbacks on the motorway as firefighters performed a ‘complex recovery operation’. It might sound like an unusual incident, but strange things often happen on the M6. In November 2021, a mountain of bottled water was left strewn across the busy motorway after two lorries crashed into each other. One of the HGVs mounted the central reservation, shedding its huge load of water bottles in the process. The other lorry came to a rest next to it causing gridlock near Morecambe, Lancashire, between junction 35 and junction 36. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
