A burglar who commented on his own police appeal saying ‘If you see me keep your mouth shut’ has been jailed for breaking into an off-duty PC’s house. Jack Martin, 21, tried to raid police officer Georgina Care’s home in south Wales but was confronted by her before he could take anything. He ran off and tried to steal a neighbour’s car keys, but had been pursued by brave PC Care. She arrested him after she heard witnesses shouting: ‘He’s jumping the fence.’ In a police interview, Martin claimed he had been with another man who ran away. He admitted burglary and burglary with intent regarding the incident in Cwmbran in June. In 2019, he previously taunted police on an appeal for her whereabouts posted online: ‘If you see me keep your mouth shut’. Prosecutor Talia Keskin told Cardiff Crown Court the recent offence was a ‘third strike’ burglary conviction for Martin. Judge Niclas Parry said: ‘These were serious burglaries for the following reasons. ‘They occurred at night, the properties were occupied, there was a confrontation, you were acting with another, you were acting under the influence of alcohol and you were on licence after being released from another sentence. ‘And on top of that you have two previous convictions for burglary and two previous convictions for attempted burglary.’ Martin, of no fixed abode, Newport, was jailed for two years and three months.
