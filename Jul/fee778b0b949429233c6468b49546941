At least 21 people have died after drinking dodgy alcohol in western India. Dozens more have also fallen ill in the Ahmedabad and Botad districts of Gujarat state, where the manufacture, sale and consumption of alcohol is prohibited. Local media said several suspected bootleggers were arrested on suspicion of selling the contaminated booze. Deaths from illegally brewed alcohol are common in India. Illicit liquor is much cheaper than the real stuff and is often spiked with pesticides and other chemicals to increase its potency. It has become hugely profitable on the black market across India where bootleggers pay no taxes. They sell enormous quantities of their dangerous product to the poor masses at a cheap rate. In 2020, at least 120 people died after drinking spiked alcohol in India’s northern Punjab state. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
