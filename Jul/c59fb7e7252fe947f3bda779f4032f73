A 16-year-old girl has been injured after being shot outside a house party in Manchester. The teenager was taken to hospital in a stable condition with a wound believed to have been caused in a drive-by-shooting. Police say the girl is not believed to have been the intended target of the attack in the city’s Moss Side area, just before 10.30pm last night. Her injuries are understood to not be serious and officers are with her as she continues to recover in hospital. Investigators believe a single shot was fired by a passing vehicle at a crowd outside the address where the party was being held. Greater Manchester Police said: ‘Inquiries are moving at pace to establish the reason for the incident and, ultimately, the people responsible for it. ‘An extensive cordon is in place as we continue to investigate the scene, and we thank the local community for their cooperation while this takes place.’ Chief Superintendent Robert Cousen said: ‘My thoughts are with the victim whose physical injuries are thankfully not serious and she is able to talk to our officers in hospital. ‘But that does not diminish what could’ve happened here as incidents of this nature are always reckless, serious and risk lives being lost. ‘We’re doing all we can to unpick the circumstances of this incident and to ensure that whoever is responsible is caught and brought to justice.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
