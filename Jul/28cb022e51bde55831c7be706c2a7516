A gruesome video shows how a severed snake head somehow ended up in an in-flight meal on a budget airline. The clearly recognisable face with eyes was filmed glistening on a meal tray by a steward. It happened on a Thursday SunExpress flight from Ankara in Turkey to Dusseldorf in Germany. SunExpress told flight website One Mile at a Time: ‘It is our top priority that the services we provide to our guests on our aircraft are of the highest quality and that both our guests and employees have a comfortable and safe flight experience. ‘The allegations and shares in the press regarding in-flight food service are absolutely unacceptable and a detailed investigation has been initiated on the subject. ‘Until the research process in question is concluded, all preventive measures and actions, including stopping the supply of the relevant product, have been taken immediately.’ Sancak Inflight Services provide in-flight meals for the airline. They said the snake head must have been added to the meal after they prepared it. ‘SunExpress Airlines is a valuable client in our country and a popular airline in Europe, which recently decided to further expand its fleet and route network,’ they said in a statement. They again announced a tender for catering services on board. ‘We did not use any of the foreign objects that were supposedly in the food when cooking (due to the technical and thermal conditions used in the in-flight catering facilities).’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
