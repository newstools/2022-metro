This is the dramatic moment British tourists on a trekking tour survived a huge avalanche in Kyrgyzstan. Footage shows a torrent of snow coming down the Tian Shan mountains, forcing the group to take cover. Incredibly, most people there were completely unscathed – with one person cutting her knee and riding to the nearest hospital and another falling off a horse, sustaining some bruising. Harry Shimm, who uploaded the video to Instagram, has said ‘if we had walked five minutes further on our trek, we would all be dead’. He said that he had broken away from his tour group of nine Brits and one American to take pictures after they reached the highest point in the trek. But he soon heard ‘ice cracking behind’ and kept filming until the last moment before he dodged under nearby shelter. Acknowledging that he ‘took a big risk’, he explained: ‘I felt in control, but regardless, when the snow started coming over and it got dark / harder to breath, I was bricking it and thought I might die.’ Harry continued: ‘Behind the rock it was like being inside a blizzard. Once it was over the adrenaline rush hit me hard. I was only covered in a small layer of snow, without a scratch. I felt giddy.’ When he found his tour group, they were ‘laughing and crying, happy to be alive’ following the terrifying experience. ‘It was only later we realised just how lucky we’d been’, he added. The Tianshan mountains are mainly split between south-eastern Kyrgyzstan and its north-east border with China. They formed part of the Silk Road, an ancient trade route that linked the West with the Middle East and Asia. The highest peak in the Tian Shan is Jengish Chokusu, at 7,439 metres (24,406 ft) high.
