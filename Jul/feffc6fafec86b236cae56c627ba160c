After Adam Collard started making moves on Paige Thorne in last night’s Love Island, his ex Rosie Williams has sent her family a warning. Rosie, 30, was dumped by Adam, 26, during the 2018 series, and his behaviour even sparked a statement from charity Women’s Aid. Last night, the personal trainer said he was a ’relationship guy’ which viewers couldn’t quite believe. Rosie isn’t buying Adam’s lines whatsoever and insisted the first ever islander to return to the villa has ‘gone on for fame’. ‘He’s done it once and didn’t find love. Well, actually he found it with Zara [McDermott] and ruined it,’ she told The Sun. After Adam cracked on with Paige, Ekin-su Cülcüloğlu, and Gemma Owen, Rosie said she’s been in touch with the person running Paige’s social media account and told them: ‘I hope my Welsh sister doesn’t do it. Tell her to stay away.’ Adam’s other ex, Zara McDermott, was absolutely floored to see Adam return to Love Island. Her boyfriend Sam Thompson actually captured the moment Zara saw Adam announced as the new bombshell, posting a video on Instagram of her freaking out. Already Adam is living up to his promise to ‘ruffle feathers’ as a preview for tonight’s episode showed a row break out between him and Paige’s partner Jacques O’Neill who has since quit Love Island altogether. From a glance, it looks as though Adam told Paige some home truths about Jacques who was not impressed. ‘Who the f**k is he?’ snapped Jacques before all hell broke loose. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
