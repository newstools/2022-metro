While most humans would struggle to stay upright on a surfboard, these dogs look like seasoned pros on the waves. They’re taking part in the UK Dog Surfing Championships, an annual event that’s now in its fourth year. Held at Branksome Dene Chine Beach in Poole, Dorset, the ‘Dog Masters’, as it’s known, kicked off this morning (Saturday July 23). Owners and their furry friends got on their boards for a number of dog surfing heats, with family entertainment provided throughout the day for spectators. Organiser, Mark Reeves said: ‘We’re really excited because after three years undefeated, reigning champions James Clarke and his beagle Bear have announced their retirement – so we’ll have to crown a new top dog!’ Up to 3,000 visitors are expected throughout the day, and around 30 dogs of all breeds are competing in the championships.   There’s no need for playful pooches to be a natural on the waves, though, as a doggy paddleboarding race is open to entrants of all abilities. Dogs are monitored to ensure they’re happy and safe in the water – and if the pictures are anything to go by, it seems like they are. One owner donned a Scooby Doo costume to guide their pet through the swell, while some competitive canines seemed to take nabbing the top spot very seriously indeed. All in all, a thoroughly adorable event. Check out these pictures to get your ‘aww’ fix for the day. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
