There’s a new kid on the block when it comes to hair colouring, delivering vibrant temporary shades like you’ve never seen them before. After attracting plenty of hype, Schwarzkopf Professional and The Unseen launched Colour Alchemy earlier this month to a waiting list of hundreds. The reason for the hype around the temporary hair colour is its uniqueness, being the world’s first temporary hair colour that changes depending on the temperature and light. The first-of-its-kind formulation uses patented structured light technology to give you iridescent never seen before colour in an instant – think mood rings, for your hair. As the temperature changes, or it’s exposed to the sun’s UV rays, the colour you see transforms too. Rich reds turn to hot pinks and deep blues turn to neon greens, creating the effect of an Aurora Borealis or resplendent peacock feathers. The product is applied to dry hair with a brush, and initially appears to look clear. However, after a blowdry (although you can leave it to dry naturally), the iridescent shades start to show up on the strands. Once you’re ready to switch your look back, simply wash the colour off. Available in five holographic hues, Colour Alchemy works on everything from blonde to black hair without the need for pre-lightening or bleaching. This doesn’t just save you time, it ensures no damage to your hair and scalp. It’s also cruelty free and housed in recyclable secondary packaging and a glass bottle. A great way to update your look without commitment, you’ll be turning heads as your dye turns you into a human chameleon. Colour Alchemy is available from The Unseen for £66, and in selected Schwarzkopf salons. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
