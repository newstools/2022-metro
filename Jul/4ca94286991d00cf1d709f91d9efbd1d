We shouldn’t have to say this, but it really isn’t a good idea to joke about bombs at an airport. On too many occasions people have been kicked off planes and airports have been evacuated over throwaway references to explosives. Still, there are people out there who’ll go ahead and make a joke as if nothing could possibly go wrong. But everything went very wrong for a Swedish national handball coach in Copenhagen who told security he had a bomb in his luggage. He allegedly ‘became angry’ when he was asked about what he had in his suitcase, and before he knew it, a bomb disposal team were at the scene. Terminal 2 of Kastrup Airport was evacuated by police this morning following the passenger’s joke and was closed for an hour, Denmark’s TV2 reports. Nothing dangerous was found in the 29-year-old man’s luggage and the cordon was lifted, but travellers faced long queues when they were allowed back inside. ‘We’d like to emphasise that you should not joke about this kind of thing, as we have to act on it,’ Copenhagen’s police tweeted. ‘The owner of the bag has been arrested and charged for making a threat.’ Swedish national team spokesman Robert Wedberg, told Sweden’s Sydsvenskan newspaper: ‘He’s been dismissed, or removed from all his assignments…It’s a police matter.’ Jokes about bombs at airports are absolutely not a good idea, but even a member of security decided to crack one at Vienna International in 2019. British humanitarian campaigner Ravi Singh was left feeling humiliated when the member of staff scanned his turban with a device and joked: ‘Yes, we found explosives’. At the time, he told Metro.co.uk: ‘If I made that comment I would be thrown in jail. I was so upset.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
