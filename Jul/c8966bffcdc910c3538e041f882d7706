Geri Horner and her daughter Bluebell enjoyed a night in Sheffield on Tuesday as they cheered on the Lionesses to victory in their Euro 2022 semi-final against Sweden. The former Spice Girl, 49, shared a rare photo of her 16-year-old daughter as they rocked matching personalised England shirts with their names emblazoned on the back. Among the mass of content excited footie fan Geri shared on her Instagram was a post dedicated to snaps with Bluebell. In one picture, the Wannabe chart-topper – which will soon celebrate its 25th anniversary – stood with her arm around her daughter, who she shares with ex Sacha Gervasi, as they took in the action on the pitch with their backs to the camera. She then tenderly planted a kiss on Bluebell’s cheek, who hugged her back. The duo also beamed for the camera in another snap together, showing off matching smiles, russet locks and blue eyes in their all-white (very on brand for Geri) outfits. ‘A moment in history! @lionesses #letgirlsplay 🏴’ the mum-of-wo exclaimed in the caption of her photos with Bluebell, following England’s thoroughly convincing 4-0 defeat of Sweden ahead of Sunday’s final. Fans were bowled over by the duo’s likeness, dubbing Bluebell ‘little Ginger Spice’ as one gushed: ‘Gosh your daughter is looking so grown up she’s beautiful and you are so alike 😍’ ‘Mom’s smile,’ noted another, while one follower commented: ‘She looks just like you.’ ‘She’s adorable looks so like you Geri, girl power right there on the pitch and standing beside you 🙌❤️,’ shared a fan. Another post included video clips of Geri celebrating some of the Lionesses’ goals, at one point yelling ‘Amazing!’ and then later singing Sweet Caroline alongside the whole stadium after the national side’s win. ‘Girl power @lionesses! So proud of you. #weuro2022 female football even better than the boys!’ she penned, with a winking emoji. ‘Come on Wembley!’ she added. Bluebell, whose full name is Bluebell Madonna, saw her moniker inspired by the flower after mum Geri revealed she’d been noticing them everywhere as she came to the end of her pregnancy. Geri’s grandmother was also part of Parisian cabaret dance act The Bluebell Girls, offering a family connection. The performer welcomed her second child, son Monty, with husband Christian Horner in 2017. Geri is due to return to Sheffield in November to pick up an honorary doctorate award from Sheffield Hallam University for her work championing children, young people and women’s rights. Ahead of her 50th birthday in August, fans have also been driven wild by reports that she will reunite with Spice Girls bandmates Emma Bunton, Mel B, Mel C and Victoria Beckham to take part in their first performance together in 10 years at her party. The party is set to take place on September 17 and will be the first time the Spice Girls have performed as a five-piece since 2012, when they performed at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics.
