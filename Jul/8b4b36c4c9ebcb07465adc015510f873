A pet store manager from Kentucky, US, has turned the rainwater cistern under his garage into an eel pit. Animal lover Nick Tobler said he was inspired to create the eel habitat when he and his brother moved into their grandmother’s old house. Once there, he inspected the home’s underground rain cistern, which was designed to store rainwater for conversion into fresh drinking water. He then decided to stock this ‘underground cave’ with some of the slippery creatures. Now, Nick is sharing his journey on TikTok through his account @CowTurtle. He currently has more than 426,000 followers and his videos get views well into the thousands. In the clips, he is often seen filling the cistern with water, eels and goldfish. ‘The very first video I posted was a week before we moved into this house,’ he told WWLT-TV. ‘I see the manhole corner in the corner of my garage, I was like “oh cool, my house comes with a future eel pond.”‘ While he often shows videos of his other pets, his eel videos are by far the most popular on TikTok. Nick also thinks eels are ‘cute.’ ‘Oh, I think they are adorable,’ he told CNN. ‘I like weird things.’ The internet has fallen in love with Nick and the eels, with people even naming them. ‘Crunch Wrap Supreme’ is the name of the biggest, while the smallest is called ‘lil bathtub.’ Nick is now planning various ways he can complete his man cave. A director’s chair is currently situated there but he also plans on adding a hammock. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
