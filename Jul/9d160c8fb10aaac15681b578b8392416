Towie star Yazmin Oukhellou is stable and recovering in hospital after surgery, her representative has confirmed. Yazmin was injured in a fatal car crash in Turkey, which claimed the life of Lauren Goodger’s ex-boyfriend Jake McLean. A statement on behalf of the reality star continued: ‘Yazmin and her family have requested privacy at this time. ‘Any updates will be given in due course.’ According to reports, McLean, 33, was driving in Bodrum, when he lost control of the car. Emergency crews rushed to the scene, but sadly he couldn’t be saved. A source told The Sun Online: ‘Apparently Jake was driving when he lost control of the car and it went off a cliff.’ ‘It’s a complete tragedy and a total loss of life,’ an insider added to Mail Online. ‘Everyone is in shock and is hoping Yazmin makes a full recovery.’ Reports claim Tazmin’s mother has also flown out to be by her bedside while she recovers in hospital. Towie cast members have voiced their support and well-wishes for Yazmin, with Harry Derbridge saying that he ‘can’t stop’ thinking about her. ‘Wishing you a speedy recovery!’ he continued. ‘Can’t wait to give you a big cuddle.’ Ella Wise shared a video of Yazmin, writing: ‘Can’t stop thinking about you,’ while Amber Turner shared a photo of herself and Yazmin, writing: ‘Thinking of you. Can everyone keep Yaz in in their prayers tonight.’ A Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office spokesman said: ‘We are supporting the family of a British man who died in Turkey and are in contact with the local authorities. ‘We are also providing support to the family of a British woman who has been hospitalised.’ Yazmin made her Towie debut in 2017 and her relationship with co-star James Lock was documented on the reality TV show.
