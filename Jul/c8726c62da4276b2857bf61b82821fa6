A man’s body has been found after a 21-year-old swimmer went missing in water close to Clacton Pier in Essex on Tuesday. Five people were pulled from the sea after swimmers got into difficulty, but one was still missing despite a large search. The swimmers who were rescued were taken to hospital on Tuesday, the hottest day ever recorded in the UK. But one man, 21, was still unaccounted for more than 24 hours on and the search was scaled down. Essex Police said a man’s body had been found in nearby Jaywick this morning but formal identification had not yet taken place. A statement said: ‘Emergency services involved in the search for a man who was last seen in the water close to Clacton Pier have this AM located a body of a man in Jaywick. ‘Formal ID has not yet taken place. ‘We’re liaising with international partners to contact the family of the 21-year-old.’ This week’s heatwave saw a new record for the hottest day ever seen in the UK, of 40.3C, in Coningsby, in Lincolnshire on Tuesday. This beat the previous record of 38.7C in Cambridge three years ago, by 1.6C. In the hot weather, there were numerous fatalities of people who had been swimming to try and cool off, for examples in rivers or at the coast. The body of a teenage boy was recovered from the River Thames in Richmond, London, on Tuesday. On the Isle of Wight on the same day, a tourist died after being pulled unresponsive from the sea.
