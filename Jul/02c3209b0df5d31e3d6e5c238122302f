After Andrew Le Page had Love Island viewers cringing beyond imaginable levels with his confession to Tasha Ghouri on Friday night, one fan has captured the moment in a pretty delicious looking cake. After the drama that was Casa Amor last week, Tasha returned to the villa to find Andrew coupled up with Coco Lodge. However, Andrew swiftly pied Coco off to make it work with Tasha and insisted all he’d done with the new bombshell was kiss and cuddle a bit in bed. But in the words of Dakota Johnson: ‘Actually, no. That’s not the truth, Andrew.’ Coco told the islanders Andrew actually ‘sucked my t*ts’ and let him know that juicy bit of gossip was about to spread around the villa like wild fire so he should probably let Tasha know. What happened next was excruciating beyond belief. Andrew told Tasha that actually he ‘licked Coco’s t*t or whatever,’ and her face said it all. The it got worse when Coco revealed that he also told her he wanted to ‘ruin her’. Love Island viewers called the drama the ‘funniest moment ever’ and one fan has taken their appreciation of the ordeal straight to the oven and baked a cake. Instagram user Cateinthekicthen shared her masterpiece alongside the caption: ‘I did what had to be done.’ We cannot thank you enough. Since t*t-gate, Andrew and Tasha’s relationship as just become more painful to watch after they stared longingly into each other’s eyes and grinned for a weirdly long time. She’s now gearing up to dump Billy Brown and will inevitably recouple up with Andrew again. Love Island continues at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
