Sunday has rolled around with scary speed, and – yet again – you’re stuck for what on earth to make the kids for dinner. I’m here to help, with a simple recipe that ticks all the boxes. My chicken pot pie is easy to make, requires just a few ingredients (and minimal faff), and pleases children and adults alike. I made this for my son, Zac, for the first time and he was a huge fan. It’s such a simple, cheat’s version of making a chicken pie using things that you likely already have at home. The recipe below makes four medium pies. I had leftover mix, which I then used in a bigger pie with added shredded chicken, onions, and mushroom, which was even better.
