Katie Price’s fiancé Carl Woods has denied any rumours of a split between the two, after it was speculated she was seen without her engagement ring and telling strangers she was ‘single’. The pair, who became engaged in April last year, reportedly split earlier this year, but were since seen back together again, and more recently, were rumoured to have broken up after the former glamour model quit social media. But now, Carl has hit back at the rumours in a new Instagram story, which features Katie in the background. ‘All of you are full of s***’, he began, showing Katie walking behind him. ‘Look here she is, I’m still at the f***ing house.’ He continued: ‘Why don’t you all just f*** off? Because do you want to know the truth? I’m the best f***ing fella she’s ever had.’ ‘And I’m the one that suffers the s***, no one else, so all this “He’s a bad person,” f*** off everyone because you’re full of s***, because I’m on the front line, I suffer the s*** and I’m the one that helps her. No one else. ‘None of you that write this b******t actually knows what goes on. I support this woman through everything. I’m the one that gets the flack, no one else. ‘So, no, we haven’t broke up, I’m still at her house so f**k off because you know nothing and you pretend. ‘I’m absolutely tired of being tarnished to be this bad person, and yes I am ranting because you know what, I’ve suffered months and months of it. ‘I’m the one that’s been made a mug of all the time and no one else, and I suffer and I help, so f*** off. ‘And look, here we are at the house having a lovely happy day, there’s Harvey, there’s Katie in the kitchen, so do one. ‘The truth is, I deserve some recognition for everything that I do. Nobody sees behind the scenes. I deserve some recognition and I get nothing. ‘Because, when the s**t hits the fan, I’m the one picking the pieces up. Me, I’m on the frontline.’ It was previously claimed that the former glamour model had been telling strangers that she’s single, and was spotted without her engagement ring. ‘Katie was letting her hair down and telling people that her engagement with Carl was over,’ a source revealed. The onlooker added to The Sun: ‘She said that the couple had been rowing non-stop on holiday and things had come to blows with her deciding to call it a day when they returned home. ‘Those close to Katie hope it is over for good after their rocky romance has taken its toll on her.’ Katie’s engagement to Love Island 2016 star Carl came after just 10 months of dating, and will marked her fourth marriage. The news follows Katie quitting social media earlier this month, due to ‘personal reasons’ amid ongoing legal woes. Got a story?
