Looking for a new and unique rental opportunity in the capital? Well, we’ve got a doozy for you right here. This compact studio flat, located in Primrose Hill, is described as a ‘small apartment with a sleeping gallery’ in a ‘quiet building.’ Photos show the small living space and narrow kitchenette, with what looks like a ladder planted smack bang in the middle of the cooking area. The white painted wood doesn’t look like the sturdiest thing we’ve ever seen but, hey, it’s quirky. And where does that ladder lead? Up to the ‘sleeping gallery’, which is just about roomy enough for a mattress and a small chest of drawers. Cosy! Thanks to the slanting roof, the top of the bedside drawers touches the ceiling, so it looks like most people would have to resort to crawling or hunching their way around the room. There’s also no garden or parking available – but there is a bathroom, you lucky things. According to the ad, the flat can accommodate two tenants – sounds perfect for a couple who really, really like being close to each other. Interested? Well, for £1,250 a month – which is £430 more than the average rent for the area (according to SpareRoom) – it could be yours. It came on the market on July 13 with OpenRent and the minimum tenancy length is 12 months. Do you have a story to share?
