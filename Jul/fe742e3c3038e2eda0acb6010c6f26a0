A man and two boys have been charged with the murder of a ‘kind-hearted and loving’ teenager in Wolverhampton. Ronan Kanda, 16, died at the scene after being attacked with a knife just before 9pm on Wednesday. A post-mortem examination revealed he had been stabbed twice on Mount Road in Lanesfield. Josiah Francis, 20, from Birmingham, and two 16-year-old boys – who cannot be named for legal reasons – will appear at Wolverhampton Magistrates’ Court on Monday.
