Nick Kyrgios blasted a heckling drunk fan for having ‘700 drinks’ and got her ejected from his Wimbledon 2022 final against Novak Djokovic. The incident occurred during the fifth game of the third set with the scores at deuce, when a woman could be heard heckling Kyrgios as he attempted a serve. The Australian world No.40 made a strong start to the Wimbledon final, winning the first set before Djokovic battled back win his seventh title on Centre Court. A furious Kyrgios turned to the umpire during the third set and said: ‘Distracting me when I’m serving in a Wimbledon final? There’s no bigger occasion. ‘You didn’t believe me [the first time] and now it’s happened again. It almost cost me the game. Why is she still here? ‘She’s drunk out of her mind in the first row speaking to me in the middle of a game. How is that acceptable? ‘Kick her out. I know exactly who it is. It’s the one with the dress… the one who looks like she has had about 700 drinks bro.’ Kyrgios was taking part in his first-ever Grand Slam final and hailed his runner-up finish as the best result of his career. It has been a controversial tournament for Kyrgios – who recorded wins over Cristian Garin, Brandon Nakashima, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Filip Krajinovic and Paul Jubb before receiving a bye to the final after Rafael Nadal’s injury. Kyrgios has been involved in arguments with umpires, line judges, fans, journalists and fellow players – calling one line judge a ‘snitch’ who had ‘no fans’. He has also been slapped with several fines, has broken Wimbledon’s dress code and has constantly hit a controversial underarm serve during matches.
