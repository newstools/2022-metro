An enormous snake with two dogs inside its stomach has been caught in north eastern Thailand. The 22ft-long python was found in wasteland with a massive bulge in its belly – and locals believe it has been living on stray and pet animals. The giant serpent was spotted slithering across abandoned construction materials at a vacant lot in Sisaket province on July 9. Video footage shows animal handlers pulling it out of an elaborate nest it had built under a pile of old concrete posts. One, Piyachat Charoensopha, explained: ‘It was one of the biggest snakes we have seen so far. ‘The python might have lived in that wasteland for a while and lived on stray animals.’ Piyachat added that a villager was looking for their two missing pet dogs, which are likely be the creatures inside the snake’s stomach. He continued: ‘A villager was looking for two dogs. ‘There were two dogs inside the snake so we believe it was the missing pets.’ The snake was found easily because of its size – and could barely move because of the size of its latest meal. It was then taken to a rehabilitation facility and will be looked after by vets. A number of python species live in Thailand, including the reticulated python, which is considered the longest snake in the world. In 2021, a farmer in Chon Buri province came across another massive 20ft-long python that required eight rescuers to pull from fields.
