Lightning strikes have killed at least 20 people in one of India’s poorest states in the space of 24 hours. Nitesh Kumar, the chief minister of Bihar, pleaded with residents to stick to advice from the region’s disaster management authority and stay indoors during bad weather. The latest fatalities mean the state has now recorded 181 deaths from lightning strikes this year alone, according to The Times of India. Although a global phenomenon, India experiences particularly high numbers of lightning-related deaths, with hundreds dying each year during monsoon rains. It is thought the fact that so many people work outdoors, tending crops and livestock in open fields, compared to other countries makes them more vulnerable as they are so exposed to the elements. Mr Kumar announced that the families of each of the deceased would be entitled to compensation amounting to £4,154. Some 1,697 people died from lightning strikes in India in 2020/21, according to an annual report by the Lightning Resilient India Campaign. Although a slight drop on the 1,771 deaths recorded in the previous financial year, lightning was still the biggest cause of accidental fatalities caused by natural occurrences, the Independent reports. A study by the non-profit Climate Resilient Observing Systems Promotion Council states that India recorded more than 18 million lightning strikes between April 2020 and March last year. That represented a 34% increase when compared to the previous 12 months. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
