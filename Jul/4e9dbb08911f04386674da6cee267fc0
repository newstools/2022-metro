Yazmin Oukhellou has spoken out about her horror crash, saying her mum has been sleeping in bed with her due to the awful nightmares she’s been left with. The Towie star was left injured in a terrifying car crash, which killed her boyfriend Jake McLean. They were in Turkey where their Mercedes went over a 70ft cliff – despite the best efforts of emergency services, McLean’s life could not be saved. ‘I have nightmares every single night since the accident,’ Yazmin told The Sun. ‘I have not stopped waking up in the night about it. Mum stays in bed with me every night.’ She is currently waiting for news from doctors about her arm, which she has been told is likely to need surgery. Yazmin previously told the outlet that she had to break her own arm to escape the crash, saying: ‘It was lay there and bleed to death, or snap my own arm to try to save us.’ ‘I am just hoping for the best and do you know what? I could have been like Jake and not survived, so I am just very grateful that if that is the worst case scenario I will deal with it as best I can,’ she added. ‘At least I am still alive.’ After the crash, Yazmin came across a man walking his dog who was able to help her and she was rushed to hospital. However, McLean was declared dead. Yazmin and McLean had been dating on and off since 2019 after she broke up with her long-term partner James Lock. Former and current Towie stars have wished Yazmin a speedy recovery on social media, and offered their condolences to the family and friends of McLean. His former girlfriend Lauren took to Instagram the day after the news broke, writing: ‘R.I.P Jake. I have no words right now. ‘My thoughts are with your family and friends.’ MORE : Towie’s Yazmin Oukhellou reveals she had to break her own arm to escape car crash that killed boyfriend Jake McLean MORE : Yazmin Oukhellou emerges in sling as she’s pictured for first time since crash in Turkey that killed Jake McLean
