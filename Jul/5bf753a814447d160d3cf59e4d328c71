The Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for extreme heat across England and Wales. Exceptionally high temperatures are forecast from Sunday into early next week. It is feared the mercury could hit a record-breaking 43°C, far surpassing the hottest day on record. That came in July 2019 when temperature dials surged to 38.7°C in Cambridge. Central, southern and eastern England are already sweltering in 30°C heat today. It could become the hottest day of the year so far if temperatures rise to 33°C. People are being urged to check up on those who may be more vulnerable, including the elderly and those with heart and respiratory problems. Water companies are also telling Brits not to waste water during the heatwave. Irresponsible use during these hot spells can lead to people not having any water running through their taps. This is not due to a shortage but because companies can’t treat water quickly enough to keep up with demand. A Southern Water spokesman said: ‘We do not anticipate the need for temporary use bans across the whole of our region in the coming months. ‘However, we may require extra measures in certain areas where water is scarcer and the pressure on supply is greatest, such as Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. ‘We are working closely with local communities and partner agencies in these areas, to keep disruption to a minimum.’ Got a story?
