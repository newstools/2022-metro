The iconic Aysgarth Falls, known for their starring role in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, have dried up in the heatwave. Waterways and reservoirs are quickly evaporating as temperatures exceed 40°C for the first time ever in the UK. The blistering heat has reduced Yorkshire’s iconic triple flight of waterfalls, near the village of Aysgarth, to tiny rockpools. They have attracted visitors for more than 200 years, including William Wordsworth and the great British artist JMW Turner. The beloved stretch of the River Ure runs from Richmond down towards Ripon, where it meets the River Ouse. It relies on rainwater to keep the falls flowing and it’s hoped a good shower will get it running again in the coming days. A spokesperson for the Yorkshire Dales National Park said: ‘The dryness of the beck is not unusual as it has happened once or twice over the last few years. ‘The unusual aspect about today (Monday) is not so much the water level but the hotness. We’re not used to seeing these temperatures in the Dales.’ It comes as the mercury topped a record-breaking 40.3°C at Coningsby, Lincolnshire – beating the previous extreme of 38.7°C, set in Cambridge in 2019. This is the first time 40°C has ever been recorded in the UK, with five areas now confirmed to have exceeded the unprecedented high. It has created tinder-box conditions across the country, with the London Fire Brigade declaring a major incident as crews tackle grassfires across the city.
