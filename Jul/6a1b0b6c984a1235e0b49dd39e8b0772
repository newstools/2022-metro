Jimy Sohns, the lead singer for American rock band The Shadows of Knight, has died at the age of 75. The musician’s death was confirmed by his daughter, who shared a heartfelt message as she told her ‘rock n roll angel’ to ‘fly high’. Earlier this week, a statement on the official Facebook page for the band confirmed that Sohns had suffered a stroke, although he was being cared for in hospital at the time. ‘We are sorry for the relaying the miscommunication regarding Jimy’s health situation. He is currently in the hospital after suffering a stroke on Friday,’ the message on Friday July 28 read. ‘He has not passed away but can certainly use the love and support from his friends and fans.’ However, just a couple of days later, Sohns’ daughter, Raechel, confirmed her father’s death. ‘From Jimy’s Daughter Raechel: “My dads is gone at 5:10pm! He wired for me to go outside and left us! Fly high my rock n roll 📐 😇”,’ the announcement on The Shadows of Knight’s Facebook profile said. The person who runs the account then continued: ‘Absolutely devastated. My thoughts go out to Jimy’s family and friends at this time. ‘My best friend is gone, and I will miss running this page with him. His legend will live on forever.’ Several fans made tribute to the late rocker, who was as young as 16 when he co-founded the band. ‘So sad and sorry about the loss of Jimy. Prayers for his soul and his family. The music community will miss him,’ one person wrote. ‘Very sad and so sorry to hear. So much history and so much to say. Rest In Peace my good friend and rock and roll brother,’ another said. Musician Steven Van Zandt, a member of Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band, wrote on Twitter: ‘RIP Jimy Sohns. Good friend and lead singer of the Shadows Of Knight. They were one of the archetypes of Garage Rock and helped define Chicago RocknRoll. Deepest condolences to his family. He will live forever in the Underground Garage.’ One of The Shadows of Knight’s biggest hits came with the release of their song Gloria in the mid-1960s, reaching number 10 in the Billboard national charts and selling over one million copies. In August 2016, musicians who made up The Shadows of Knight’s original line-up reunited for the first time in 49 years to perform a concert. Then two years ago, Sohns and guitarist Jerry McGeorge – who joined the band in 1965 – released a new single called Wild Man 53 years after their last collaboration. In April this year, Sohns shared on Facebook how much he loved interacting with fans, writing: ‘I loved signing autographs then and I still love signing them 55 years later…share your autographs here if you have one, would love to hear your stories.’ Got a story?
