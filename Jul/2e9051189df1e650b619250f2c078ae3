Gritters across England are being mobilised in response to the sudden burst of warm weather. This weekend, the mercury may rise again to 31°C in places such as London, Reading and Oxford. Water companies have even urged people to ration water supplies to prevent limits from being imposed. Work is already underway to fix a stretch of the A140, which links Norfolk and Suffolk, which was damaged by the heat yesterday. Councils have now fleets of gritters at the ready to respond if more roads ‘melt’ due to high temperatures. Hampshire County Council said the machines will be spreading light dustings of sand. This ‘acts like a sponge to soak up excess bitumen’, according to the local authority. Road chiefs in Doncaster and Lincolnshire also have gritters poised to be sent out on similar excursions. Gritters are normally used to distribute salt during the winter to stop ice forming on roads. The areas most likely to be targeted by the vehicles this week are those with older road surfaces, in rural locations and south facing. Any motorists who find tar stuck to their tyres are advised to wash it off with warm soapy water. Residents are being urged to report any road problems on their local council’s website. This week’s hot weather comes with a warning, with a Level Three Heat Health Alert has been issued by the Met Office and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Those most at risk from the heat are older people, those who find it hard to cool down and people who spend a lot of time in hot places or outside. To keep cool people are advised to stay hydrated, keep out of the sun between 11am- 3pm and avoid exercising during the hottest parts of the day.
