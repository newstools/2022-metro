England Women’s Euro 2022 campaign got off to a winning start as they edged Austria 1-0 in the opening game of the tournament. In front of a record-breaking attendance at Old Trafford, the Three Lionesses were made to work for the victory by a stubborn Austria side, with both sides struggling to generate any meaningful chances in the opening stages of the game. But on the 16th minute, the deadlock was broken as Beth Mead brilliantly controlled a Fran Kirby pass before lobbing goalkeeper Manuel Zinsberger, with the ball just crossing the line in time before an Austrian defender could hack it away. The game opened up after that, but England frustratingly could not finish any more of their chances in the first-half with Ellen White missing two great heading opportunities, while Lauren Hemp had a shot well-saved from close range. The second-half proved to be a similar affair with the hosts controlling the tempo of the match but unable to add to their lead, with Chloe Kelly coming shooting just wide after an excellent counter. It was a solid defensive job by Austria who always looked dangerous but lacked much creativity in the final third with England keeper Mary Earps largely unchallenged. While not the most spectacular of results, it was a great win from which Sarina Wiegman’s side can build on, with their next Group A match on Monday against Norway.
