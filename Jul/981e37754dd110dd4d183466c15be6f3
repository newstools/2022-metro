Boris Johnson will make a statement to the nation today following the collapse of his Government, Downing Street has confirmed. The Prime Minister has woken up to a fresh wave of resignations, now totalling more than 50, and it appears he has finally realised his time is up. Nadhim Zahawi, who was appointed as Chancellor just 36 hours ago, may have delivered the final nail in the coffin with a blistering statement telling him to resign. It is understood Mr Johnson’s team is now writing his resignation letter, which he is expected to read out in front of 10 Downing Street at 12.30pm. The PM refused to budge last night despite a face-off with his own Cabinet ministers, who told him he had lost the confidence of the Tory party and could not continue in office. Mr Johnson lashed out by sacking Michael Gove and even pledged a new economic programme last night – even though he’d struggle to implement anything without any ministers. But the writing was clearly on the wall for the most controversial leader in recent times. He is now set to become the third Conservative PM brought down by Tory infighting in the space of six years. If he does step aside today, he could become a caretaker leader while his successor is decided in a Tory leadership contest. But given the chaotic nature of the past few weeks, Tory MPs may be looking for a clean break with Mr Johnson a long way from Downing Street during this turbulent process. Got a story?
