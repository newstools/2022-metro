Ajax are now demanding around £52million in total for Manchester United to sign Lisandro Martinez and will not entertain bids with additional add-on payments. The Argentina international is desperate to join the Red Devils and he has twice urged his club to negotiate in good faith with United. However, the Dutch giants have tried to start a bidding war for Martinez’s services between United and Arsenal in order to extract a bigger fee for the 24-year-old. United’s latest bid of around £43m was rejected by Ajax as the club felt the offer was too low and it included £5m of add-ons. Despite the rejection, United felt that they were getting closer to an agreement but Dutch outlet the Telegraaf claim Ajax now want £52m upfront for Martinez. The Amsterdam club will not listen to offers with add-ons and feel that they can get an upfront fee for the centre-back. Erik ten Hag is desperate to sign Martinez and he had hoped to have the defender at the club for the tour of the far-east. United expect to complete the signing of Christian Eriksen on a free transfer this week, while they remain locked in negotiations for Frenkie de Jong.
