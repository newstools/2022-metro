A woman who left several children with broken bones after crashing into them has had six points put on her licence. Dolly Rincon-Aguilar, 39, is believed to have pressed the accelerator instead of the brake in her Toyota Rav4 outside Beatrix Potter Primary School in Earlsfield, south west London. She mounted the pavement, hit a tree and then smashed into 11 people, including seven children, trapping some of them under her 4×4. Injuries included fractures to children’s faces, skulls, legs, arms and eye sockets, while a seven-year-old boy had to have emergency treatment for a blood clot. Rincon-Aguilar, from Wandsworth, denied eight counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving but was found guilty at Kingston Crown Court. As well as the points, she was ordered to pay a £3,000 fine and £930 costs. Jurors heard Rincon-Aguilar was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, had no health issues or problems at the time and got her automatic driver’s licence in 2019. There were no obstructions due to the weather, radio or a mobile phone and the vehicle had tax, MOT and insurance. Rincon-Aguilar said: ‘I think my heart is broken in two. I just wish that I could take away all the pain and all the frustration.’ The court heard from PC Sean Wakeman from the Metropolitan Police, who said there was ‘unintended acceleration due to a misapplication of the accelerator pedal’. He said: ‘Had she applied sufficient pressure to the brake pedal, the Toyota would have come to a stop and this might have avoided any casualties.’ Asked about the police’s conclusion there was ‘pedal misapplication’ – she said: ‘I think that is all right.’ A close friend of Rincon-Aguilar said she is ‘just the most kind and most generous and most selfless person I have ever met’, while her father-in-law, Neil Livingston, said she was an ‘honest, forthright, rather shy’ person.
