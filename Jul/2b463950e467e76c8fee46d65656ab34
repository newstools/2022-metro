When you’re pregnant, some people think you and your bump are fair game for random touching and unsolicited comments. One mum has taken to social media to share some of the frustrating comments she’s got from people on the size of her bump. Eliana Rodriguez, who was pregnant with her second child (yes, singular) at the time, shared a clip of her lip-syncing along to the lyrics ‘I didn’t even notice’ from Doja Cat’s ‘Say So.’ Over the video are captions quoting what people have said to her, including: ‘You are huge’, and ‘You look like you’re having twins!’ Other quotes are: ‘You must be in so much pain!’ and ‘Have you checked if there’s another baby in there?’ In the video, Eliana, from Las Vegas, Nevada, has bared her bump, and admittedly it is not small. But whether your bump is tiny or massive, it’s doubtful a pregnant person is unaware of it, so why some people decide to comment on others’ bodies at will is beyond us. Some people have unfortunately voiced their opinions on her bump in the comments of the post, which has earned nearly 7,000 likes so far, thus proving Eliana’s point even more. Others have voiced their annoyance at unsolved bump comments, and support for Elaina, with one writing: ‘ ‘It’s SO annoying isn’t it,’ one person wrote. ‘I’ve noticed people say this to almost every pregnant woman… There’s a whole baby in there what do they expect?’ Another commented: ‘Twins or not twins no one should harshly judge, or negatively comment about a woman’s pregnant belly. Different women are built differently.’ ‘People need to put a sock in it,’ said one mum-to-be. ‘Currently pregnant and I am this close to being rude to everyone that has something to say about the size of my belly.’ Do you have a story to share?
