Manchester United have submitted an improved offer for Ajax defender Lisandro Martinez who is now hellbent on joining a Premier League club. The versatile Argentina international defender has informed the Dutch club of his intention to leave before the transfer window closes amid strong interest from both United and Arsenal. Both English powerhouses have failed with a series of bids that have failed to match Ajax’s valuation but United now appear to be in pole position after tabling an offer €50million, including bonuses, according to De Teleegraf. Ajax have been adamant all summer that they are determined to keep hold of their best players, especially in light of Ryan Gravenberch’s departure to Bayern Munich. The Eredivisie champions have also been fending off interest in the likes of Jurrien Timber and Antony, who are both on Ten Hag’s wishlist, but United’s latest offer for Martinez is likely to be too good to turn down. According to TyC Sports in Argentina, meanwhile, Martinez now has his heart set on a reunion with Ten Hag and has decided to snub Arsenal. Mikel Arteta had viewed the 24-year-old as the perfect candidate to offer cover for Gabriel Magalehaes and Kieran Tierney, who missed the vital run-in last season with a serious knee injury. The Arsenal manager and technical director Edu were reported to have been in regular contact with Martinez in order to convince to join their rebuilding project at the Emirates, but the chance to work with Ten Hag has proven to the decisive factor in his decision. The Gunners are likely to now focus on alternative targets with Benfica’s Grimaldo on their radar.
