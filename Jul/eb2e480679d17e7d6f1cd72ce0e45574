Neymar says he wants to stay at Paris Saint-Germain and the club have not told him they want him to leave this summer, although his manager admits he does not know what will happen with the Brazilian during the transfer window. After Kylian Mbappe surprisingly changed his mind on a move to Real Madrid and stayed in Paris, the future of Neymar was brought into question. The striker was linked with a move to the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City, but no bids have come to pass for the 30-year-old. The former Barcelona star replaced Mbappe in a friendly win over Urawa Red Diamonds on Saturday and spoke about his future after the match, insisting that he has no intention to leave and the club have not suggested they want him to either. ‘I still want to stay here with the club,’ Neymar said after the 3-0 win in Japan. ‘So far the club hasn’t said anything to me so I don’t know what their plans are for me. ‘I don’t need to prove myself to anyone — I just need to play my football and I have to be happy playing football.’ New PSG manager Christophe Galtier was much less bullish, though, and admitted that he did not know whether Neymar would stay or go this summer. ‘What will happen in the near future when the transfer window closes, I don’t know,’ said Galtier. ‘We announce he’s leaving, we announce he’s staying — I haven’t spoken to Ney about this. But he doesn’t seem to be bothered about what is said about him and his situation at the club.’ MORE : Glen Johnson urges Chelsea to go ‘all out’ for West Ham star Declan Rice and responds to shock Neymar links MORE : ‘Not true’ – Pep Guardiola shuts down Neymar to Manchester City transfer links For more stories like this, check our sport page.
