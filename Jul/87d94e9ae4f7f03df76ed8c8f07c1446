Disaster has been avoided after a speedy reaction to an explosion close to the base of the Hoover Dam. A large cloud of black smoke rose from a building near the iconic dam shortly after 10am. Incredibly the fire was extinguished by workers at the site before the Boulder City Fire Department arrived. Footage from a tourist at the scene at the time shows the plume rising from part of the 726-foot tall dam as a person in the background can be heard saying, ‘My goodness, something has just blown up.’ A second video shared to TikTok shows a different angle of the explosion, which social media users speculate occurred at the dam’s generators or turbines. Preliminary investigations suggest that a transformer had caught fire, according to the Bureau of Reclamation. They added that nobody was injured and power supplies were not affected. The Hoover Dam impounds the largest US reservoir, Lake Mead, where human remains were discovered earlier this year as drought caused its water levels hit a historic low. The historic dam, located about 30 miles southeast of Las Vegas, was constructed during the Great Depression. Its situated along the Colorado River on the border of Nevada and Arizona and receives millions of tourists each year, making it the most-visited dam in the world.
