London’s Soho was well and truly filled with people celebrating the 50th anniversary of Pride last night, as it returned to the capital for the first time in two years. The West End neighbourhood, an epicentre for the LGBTQ+ community, was decorated with an abundance of rainbow flags lighting up the streets with colour. Iconic venues in the area hosted their own after-parties while many revellers gathered in the streets to mingle. Couples shared kisses, friends drank and danced, and the police officers were seen smiling amid the fun, despite being banned from joining the parade. Earlier in the day, over a million people paraded through the capital to mark the big Pride milestone. The celebration, which had been halted due to the Covid pandemic, returned to the capital for what organisers called the ‘biggest and most inclusive event in history’. Crowds had been led by the Gay Liberation Front whose activists took part in the original 1972 parade, where 2,000 marched in protest of police treatment towards the LGBTQ+ community. This year saw some 600 groups and organisations join the parade from Hyde Park Corner to Whitehall. In Trafalgar Square, famous faces such as Dame Kelly Holmes and Peter Schofield – both of whom have come out in recent years – addressed the crowds, while an array of artists performed.
