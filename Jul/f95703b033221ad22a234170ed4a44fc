The US has confirmed the first two cases of monkeypox in children. One of the infections was a toddler from California and the child was not an American resident, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday (CDC). ‘CDC and public health authorities are still investigating how the children became infected,’ stated the agency. ‘While both children have monkeypox symptoms, they are in good health.’ ‘Both of those children are traced back to individuals who come from the men-who-have-sex-with-men community, the gay men’s community,’ said CDC Director Rochelle Walensky during a virtual event with the Washington Post. The two children ‘are doing well’, Walensky added. Children under the age of 8 are at ‘especially increased risk’ of developing severe cases of the disease, according to the CDC. CDC officials last week said they were aware of monkeypox cases in adults only. The majority of cases have been found in men who have sex with men, and cases have been for the most part ‘adjacent to the community most at risk’, Walensky said. As of Thursday, there were 2,593 monkeypox cases in the US in 44 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, according to the CDC.
