England men’s captain Harry Kane has sent a message of good luck to England’s women side ahead of tonight’s Euro 2022 final against Germany. The Lionesses will walk out to a record-breaking crowd at Wembley, where they will be hoping to win a first major trophy. It would be the country’s first since 1966 when the men beat Germany at Wembley to lift the World Cup. Kane came close to ending the wait last summer when his side were narrowly beaten by Italy on penalties at Euro 2020, which was postponed 12 months because of the pandemic. And the Spurs striker has sent a message to the Lionesses ahead of tonight, wishing the side all the best. ‘Hi Lionesses, I just wanted to wish you all the best for today’s game against Germany,’ said Kane. ‘It’s going to be an incredible experience, incredible atmosphere at Wembley. ‘I can’t wait to be there myself, so I’m wishing you all the best. ‘Good luck, go get that win, the whole country’s behind you. ‘Really looking forward to it, so all the best.’ Germany beat England 6-2 the last time the two teams faced each other in the tournament, which was the final in 2009. England have never won the tournament, while Germany have lifted it on eight occasions. Sarina Wiegman, England’s manager, does have a successful history in the tournament though, having led the Netherlands to victory five years ago.
