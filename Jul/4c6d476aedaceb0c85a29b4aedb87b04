Love Island kissed goodbye to two couples as Deji Adeniyi, Lacey Edwards, Reece Ford, and Nathalia Campos were dumped from the villa in scenes that aired on Sunday night. With just eight days left before the final, the competition has been hotting up and the fight for the £50,000 prize is well and truly underway. The public had been voting for their favourite couples, and it was soon the end of the road for the four islanders. Speaking after their exit, Reece said: ‘I didn’t find love in the villa, but I’m sure there’s plenty of girls out there waiting for me.’ Meanwhile, Lacey said of Deji: ‘I came here to find one thing which was a connection and I feel like I found it.’ Despite being friend zoned by Davide, Nathalia is rooting for Davide and Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu to win. ‘Davide and Ekin-Su have a very good chemistry,’ she revealed. ‘They get along very well, they are also very entertaining so I think they have a very big chance of winning the show.’ And despite locking horns with Ekin-Su over pizza, Nathalia insisted that there’s no beef between them anymore. ‘The pancake competition, that was just hilarious, two grown-ass women battling it out over pancakes, that was just funny and it was a good way of breaking the ice with Ekin-Su. ‘Me and her are good now, we have no problems, you can always solve whatever problem you have in the kitchen.’ Love Island continues on Monday at 9pm on ITV2.
