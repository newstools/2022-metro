Thomas Strakosha is close to joining Manchester United, with the goalkeeper available on a free transfer after leaving Lazio this summer. The Red Devils are looking for a new deputy for David De Gea after Dean Henderson moved to Nottingham Forest on loan in search of first team football. The 27-year-old made 208 appearances for Lazio, the only permanent club of his career so far, with a loan spell at Salernitana in 2015-16. He wasn’t a guaranteed starter at Lazio over the last two years, though, making just 32 Serie A starts in two campaigns, so he let his contract run down and expire this summer. Strakosha is not going to be getting a lot of first team football at Old Trafford either, but talkSPORT report that a deal is close to being agreed for him to sign for Manchester United. Born in Greece, the ‘keeper has picked up 19 caps for Albania and has won silverware at Lazio, lifting the Coppa Italia in 2013 and ’19. Henderson has gone on loan to Nottingham Forest on a season-long loan and it is not clear what will happen to him after that campaign with the newly-promoted side. 31-year-old De Gea only has one year left on his current contract, although could be offered a new deal as he remains the clear first choice with the gloves. New manager Erik ten Hag will make his decision on the position over the coming season as to whether he will stick with the Spaniard of place his faith in another stopper.
