A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a body believed to be that of a missing woman was found in South Yorkshire. Abi Fisher, 29, had not been seen since she left her home in Castleford, West Yorkshire, on Friday night. Her family said it was ‘completely out of character’ for her to leave without telling them where she was going. Today, police said they had launched a murder investigation after finding a body in undergrowth off Southmoor Road, near Brierley in South Yorkshire, yesterday. Although the body is yet to be formally identified it is believed to be that of Ms Fisher. Her family have been updated and are being supported by specially trained officers. A man, 29, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in custody. Police have appealed for footage from anyone with a dashcam who was driving on the B6273 Southmoor Road between Hemsworth and Great Houghton between 8.15am and 9.15am on Saturday. Detective Chief Superintendent Mark Swift said: ‘On behalf of the police and Abi’s family, I would like to express our thanks to everyone who has assisted in the search for Abi. ‘We know that there has been a real community effort to find her and that this update will be upsetting for many. ‘The body has not yet been formally identified and we will update in due course when this has been confirmed. ‘We are carrying out extensive enquiries and as part of that are appealing to the public to help us by providing any information that could help our investigation. ‘We are particularly keen to hear from anyone with dashcam footage from Southmoor Road on Saturday morning and have set up a specific portal for footage to be submitted to.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
