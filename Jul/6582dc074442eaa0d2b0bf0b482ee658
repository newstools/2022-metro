As Boris Johnson addressed the nation and announced his resignation as Prime Minister, his wife, Carrie Johnson, stood right by, baby Romy in tow. What does one wear as your husband quits his job after receiving a record number of resignations from the Cabinet? A nice red frock with a teeny-tiny polka dot print, of course. You could read plenty into the choice of colour (defiant? Powerful? …An unexpected show of support for the Labour party?), but it’s worth noting that this isn’t much of a depature for Carrie – she also wore a red dress for an appearance at the Conservative Party conference in 2021, and for the Queen’s Jubilee thanksgiving service in June this year. Going for a simple, summery style of dress rather than a full-on power suit or anything especially spangly fits in with the message that Carrie was at 10 Downing Street purely as Boris’s partner, showing support rather than any political ambition. This time around, the red dress in question is a £325 one from L.K. Bennett. It’s a re-wear, rather than a new buy just for the occasion – she donned the same frock to meet Joe Biden. Perhaps we’ll see it sell out as people scramble for their own resignation red outfit. If you do fancy buying said dress, you’re out of luck, as while it was on sale for £225, it’s since sold out (pre Boris’s resignation, not as a result of). Accessory-wise, multiple rings on her fingers, small gold hoops on her ears, and a snazzy papoose on her front. Note the flash of red on Romy’s socks – now that’s colour coordination.
