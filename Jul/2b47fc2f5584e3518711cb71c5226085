Nick Kyrgios has been charged with a common assault of his ex-girlfriend Chiara Passari and is due to face court in Australia in August, reports the Canberra Times. The alleged incident took place in December 2021, as confirmed by police in Canberra. ‘ACT Policing can confirm a 27-year-old Watson man is scheduled to face the ACT Magistrates Court on the 2nd of August in relation to one charge of common assault following an incident in December 2021,’ police said on Tuesday. The allegation is that Kyrgios grabbed Passari, with the charge carrying a maximum sentence of two years in prison. Barrister Jason Moffett confirmed that Kyrgios was aware of the charge and will not comment on it at this stage. Moffett told the Canberra Times: ‘It’s in the context of a domestic relationship. ‘The nature of the allegation is serious, and Mr Kyrgios takes the allegation very seriously. ‘Given the matter is before the court … he doesn’t have a comment at this stage, but in the fullness of time we’ll issue a media release.’ Kyrgios and Passari dated from 2020 to late last year, with the tennis star now engaged Costeen Hatzi. The 27-year-old is currently in London preparing for a Wimbledon quarter-final against Cristian Garin on Wednesday. It is a far more serious controversy than those which have followed Kyrgios around at Wimbledon this summer, most recently over him wearing a red cap and shoes, which is against the dress code at SW19. Asked about dealing with controversy during tennis tournaments, he said: ‘I haven’t moaned. I love it. ‘It’s just more attention for me. What’s that saying? Any publicity is good publicity, right?’ MORE : Nick Kyrgios refuses to back down in row over breaking Wimbledon dress code MORE : Nick Kyrgios and Stefanos Tsitsipas hit with big fines after spicy Wimbledon clash For more stories like this, check our sport page.
