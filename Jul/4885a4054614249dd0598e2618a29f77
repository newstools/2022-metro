A British honeymooner died while swimming in dangerous currents despite red flags warning people not to get into the water. Thailand is in the middle of its annual rainy season, bringing tropical monsoon downpours, strong winds and extremely powerful ocean currents. This is why people were banned from swimming on the Kata Noi Beach, in Phuket. But Ali Mohammed Mian, 34, decided to go for a swim on Thursday anyway. The strong waves dragged him away from the shore, where he started drowning and became unconscious. Lifeguards pulled him out and gave him CPR but he was declared dead. He had only been on honeymoon for two days before the tragedy happened. He has been identified and his family in the UK have been contacted. Another Thai swimmer, Surasit Phonglaohaphan, 55, died in the exact same way. The men were not believed to be swimming together but they were rescued at the same time. ‘They disobeyed the red flag and were swept away by the waves,’ local lieutenant colonel Kittipong Nupheng said. Two other tourists, a couple in their 30s, also had to be rescued after swimming in the sea. But they were taken to hospital and survived. It all comes after backpackers Anna Carreras, 21, from Spain, and Rahul Ramkurrun, 22, from France, drowned last Sunday. They had ignored red flags and went for a swim on the island of Koh Chang islan, in Trat province. They had told hotel staff they were going to watch the sunrise, after an alleged night out drinking with friends, but they ended up in the water instead.
