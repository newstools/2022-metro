 A mum pushed over in a fiercely competitive parents’ race at sports day has vowed ‘next year, it’s war’. Chelsey Walford, 24, was about to win the race when red-haired Katie McDermott, 25, took drastic action and knocked her over. The shove left Chelsey, from Coventry, with cuts and a bump on her leg. She was even given an ice pack by the teachers. Chelsey said: ‘I wasn’t expecting it. My leg is bruised and I have cuts but I didn’t get hurt. The teachers got me an ice pack after. ‘There was a big bump on it but that’s gone down now, just got the bruise. Dirty tactics – it’s got to be done. Next year, it’s war!’ Katie last week admitted she was prepared to do anything to win. ‘I told my daughter I would be number one, so I had to be,’ she said. ‘I could see she was winning so I just gave her a quick nudge and she took off in the air. ‘I don’t know what possessed me to do it, I was just thinking about how I wanted to win so badly. ‘I didn’t know the mum very well. Everyone was shocked but we just carried on as normal afterwards. ‘If you see this, sorry that I pushed you, I didn’t mean to send you flying. I don’t regret it though, because I won.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
