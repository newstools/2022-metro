Ever heard of ‘cheengu blue’? We hadn’t either, until the calming shade made its way to our Pinterest feeds. Stylist journalist Leah Sinclair explained: ‘The cool tone has seen a surge of interest on the social media platform, with people sharing how they incorporate the hue in their clothes, make-up and homes.’ Cheengu blue is similar to baby blue, like a lighter version of cornflower blue or Pantone’s colour of the year, Very Peri. Many of cheengu blue images online are tagged as a ‘South Korean aesthetic’ – and while there’s very little information out there about what cheengu actually means, it may derive from the Korean word chingu, which means friend. The chambray hue is featured on everything from milk cartons to handbags, with cloud and ocean imagery alongside cutesy daisy prints and clean lines. Not only is the colour calming, it goes perfectly with neutrals and brights alike, conjuring thoughts of fresh washing hung out to dry against a perfect blue sky.
