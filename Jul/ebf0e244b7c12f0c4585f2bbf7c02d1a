Zhou Guanyu has thanked fans for their support after the Alfa Romeo driver crashed heavily at the start of Sunday’s British Grand Prix. As the lights went out for the race at Silverstone, AlphaTauri’s Pierre Gasly clipped the Mercedes of George Russell, sending the Brit into the side of Zhou and flipping his car upside down. The Alfa Romeo subsequently skidded at high-speed towards the barriers at Abbey Corner before landing into the catch fencing. The race was red flagged instantly and it was some time before the marshals were able to get the Chinese driver out of his car, before he was taken on a stretcher to the medical centre. Almost an hour after the crash, the grand prix restarted with Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz Jr. taking his first ever Formula 1 victory, and during the race the FIA announced that Zhou was okay and had been discharged. He was later pictured talking to F1 CEO Stefano Domenicali and took to Twitter to update fans of his condition, saying: ‘I’m ok, all clear. ‘Halo saved me today. Thanks everyone for your kind messages!’ Upon seeing the crash, Russell stopped and ran from his car to check on Zhou, before retiring from the race, although he did not wish to. ‘First of all, the most important thing is that Zhou is ok,’ the Brit posted on Twitter. ‘That was a scary incident and all credit to the marshals and medical team for their quick response. Obviously gutted to end the race this way and I’m sorry for the team and the fans. Cheering LH [Lewis Hamilton] on from the garage.’ MORE : Zhou Guanyu involved in serious multi-car crash at British Grand Prix MORE : Carlos Sainz Jr. wins dramatic British Grand Prix after huge first lap crash For more stories like this, check our sport page.
