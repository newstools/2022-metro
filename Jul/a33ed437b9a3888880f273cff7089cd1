For a certain time during the early noughties, the Motorola Razr was the coolest phone around. The flip phone famously toted in a bright shade of pink by Paris Hilton was in everyone’s hands long before the iPhone arrived. And although Apple’s all-conquering gadget has ended up dominating our pockets, the time is ripe for a comeback. Motorola has confirmed it will be launching a new version of the Razr in China on August 2. Whether it comes to the UK after that remains to be seen, but it’s a fair bet we could be seeing Motorola Razrs on the shelves of Currys once again. And although it’s likely to look pretty similar to the iconic design of 2004, a lot has changed on the inside. The Moto Razr 2022 is tipped to feature top-of-the-line specs like a 120Hz folding screen, a Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor and a triple-lens camera system. As Paris would say; that’s hot. Motorola clearly isn’t aiming the new Razr at the iPhone crowd, but instead is likely hoping to steal a march on Samsung. The South Korean tech giant has been steadily releasing foldable phones (where the actual screen bends) for a few years now. Samsung’s next pair of foldable phones, the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Z Flip 4, are rumoured to launch on August 10. So Motorola clearly wants to disrupt the party with the return of the Razr. Of course, this Razr reboot can have all the specs in the world, but if you can’t hang up on someone without closing it, we’re not interested. Details are scarce at the moment, but we’re pretty confident you’ll be able to slam this new phone shut when you’ve finished getting sassy with your caller. Now, let’s just hope the new one comes in pink.
