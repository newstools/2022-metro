Christine McGuinness has broken her silence after she and her husband Paddy McGuinness were plagued by split rumours, saying the pair are ‘really good’. The couple, who have been married for 11 years, faced rumours when fans thought that Paddy, 48, had had his tattoo dedicated to Christine removed. However, Christine, 34, has shut down any speculation, saying: ‘We’re really good, honestly.’ She added to OK!: ‘We have had difficult times but when I look back at our marriage and see where we are now, I think, “Wow, you know, we’ve done alright!” ‘I first met Paddy 14 years ago and now we’ve got three gorgeous kids, we’ve been married for 11 years, we’re both busier than ever, but doing really great stuff. ‘I couldn’t ask for anything more from him. I’m so grateful. I’m happy, I’ve got no complaints.’ Christine also praised Paddy’s parenting skills, with the pair sharing twins Leo and Penelope, and daughter Felicity. Christine met Paddy while modelling at an event in 2007 and the pair married three years later at Thornton Manor. Paddy joked in his autobiography that although he and Christine don’t have much in common, the things that matter made their marriage last, explaining: ‘We don’t like the same films, TV programmes or food, we wouldn’t have a night out together, and we annoy each other most of the time. ‘I hardly know any of her mates, and aside from living in the same house we have totally separate lives. ‘So why are we still married after a decade? Answer: we laugh and make love… a lot.’ Got a story?
