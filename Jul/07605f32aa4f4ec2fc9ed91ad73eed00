A mother-of-three has been banned from driving for a year after being caught hugely over the limit 13 hours after a coke binge with her boyfriend. Emily Stopforth – nicknamed Crazy Em – was stopped in her BMW X5 on February 9 because the front seat passenger was fidgeting so much. They could smell cannabis coming from the vehicle so they carried out a drugs test. They found that she was 11 times over the legal limit for benzoylecgonine – the main metabolite of cocaine. Stopforth, 29, from Southport, Merseyside, tried to avoid a ban by saying that she needed her car to ferry around her children. Her defence solicitor Amanda Sheppard said: ‘At the end of January her mother had been given a diagnosis of sclerosis of the liver with a life expectancy of two years. ‘Shortly after this she took an overdose and ended up in A&E and a few weeks later she went off the rails a bit and took cocaine on occasions. ‘She did take cocaine on a night out with her partner. It was a rare night out, she has three children and was in bed by 10pm. ‘She did not think that the cocaine taken the night before would still be in her system. She’s not a frequent user of drink and drugs necessarily and therefore she did not understand the consequences of how that would stay in her system for a number of days after that.’ Chairwoman Angela McIntyre said: ‘It was an expensive cocaine hit with everything that has happened. I would not bother doing it again.’ She was banned for a year and ordered to pay just under £300 in fines and costs. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
