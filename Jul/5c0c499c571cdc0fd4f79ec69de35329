Nelson Piquet used both racist and homophobic language to describe Sir Lewis Hamilton, new footage has shown. Former Formula 1 world champion Piquet was heavily condemned earlier this week after a video of the Brazilian using a racial slur while discussing Hamilton emerged. But on Friday, the matter was escalated further after more footage of Piquet was revealed where he again used the same racial slur as well as homophobic language while talking about Hamilton, his former teammate and world champion Nico Rosberg and Rosberg’s father Keke, himself a world champion who raced against Piquet in the 1980s. On a Brazilian podcast, he said: ‘Keke? He was a s***! He’s worthless. ‘His son [Nico] won the championship. The ‘n*******’ was [more focused on] giving a** at that time. He was kinda bad.’ Piquet appears to be referring to the 2016 title battle where Nico Rosberg pipped Mercedes teammate Hamilton to become world champion. His comments had already received widespread backlash from those within the F1 community and beyond, with reports suggesting that the three-time title winner has now been banned indefinitely from the F1 paddock. Piquet had issued an apology to Hamilton but claimed he was not a racist and that his remarks had been mis-translated. Hamilton for his part has further reiterated the need for change and has called for ‘older voices’ to not be given a platform to share their ‘archaic mindset.’ ‘These old voices are, you know, whether subconsciously or consciously, do not agree that people like me, for example, should be in a sport like this, do not agree women should be here,’ he said on Thursday. ‘Discrimination is not something we should be giving a platform. We need people to be bringing people together. We are all the same and the comments we are seeing are not helpful.’ MORE : Lewis Hamilton backs down in Formula 1 jewellery row ahead of British Grand Prix MORE : Lewis Hamilton thanks fans for their support in Nelson Piquet controversy For more stories like this, check our sport page.
