WhatsApp’s in-chat reactions is soon going to include every emoji, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Monday. Since May, users have been able to react to messages with six emojis: the thumbs-up, heart, hands together, mouth open, crying face and tears of laughter face. The latest update will allow them to react with any emoji in the app, and adapt them with the in-built skin tone selector. Zuckerberg made the announcement in a Facebook post on Monday, giving users the opportunity to comment on the news. Some users were pleased to hear the news. One wrote: ‘I LOVE this!! Can’t wait to see it in action.’ But the bulk of users responded to the Facebook founder’s post with requests for further upgrades to WhatsApp and other services owned by its parent company, Meta. ‘Give poll option in Facebook,’ said one user, while another asked: ‘Can we have voice note on the comment section?’ Others requested WhatsApp saved photos at a higher quality, or offered cloud media services. The company announced several other improvements to the service on Monday, including allowing users to send files up to 2GB in size within the app. This is a major increase on the previous limit of 100MB. WhatsApp says this will help small businesses and school groups collaborate better through the app. In addition, the company is also going to allow users to add up to 512 users to a group. WhatsApp says larger groups are one of its most commonly requested features.
