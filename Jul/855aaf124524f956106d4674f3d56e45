Erik ten Hag admits he wants to strengthen in midfield and attack this summer, with the club ‘looking’ for players that fit the right profile in those areas. United have signed just one player so far this summer following the £13million arrival of Tyrell Malacia. The club have spent almost two months in negotiations for Frenkie de Jong, while they have agreed personal terms with Christian Eriksen over a move to Old Trafford. But Cristiano Ronaldo’s desire to leave the club has complicated matters for Ten Hag, who had not planned on signing another centre forward. And the Dutchman admitted today that the club are working on signing a central midfielder and an attacker. ‘We want to have the right players,’ said Ten Hag.‘We have a really good squad, we are working on to develop our way of playing and if the opportunity is there we will strike [to sign new players]. ‘I said already definitely we are searching for players in midfield and I think that we have a need in offence. We are still working for players.’ Asked specifically about the club’s pursuit of De Jong, Ten Hag refused to get drawn on the speculation. ‘I never talk about players that are not contracted to Manchester United.‘I cannot tell anything about this issue.’ MORE : Jurgen Klopp rules out more Liverpool transfers and makes blunt midfield situation claim For more stories like this, check our sport page.
