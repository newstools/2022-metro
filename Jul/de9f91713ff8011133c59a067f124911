Looking for ways to make yourself feel better on flights? Well, it turns out there’s a viral video for that. Vlogger Anna Paul shared a hack on her TikTok page, saying it came ‘from a real pilot’. In the video, which has over 4million likes so far, she holds up a pot of jelly and says: ‘So, pretend this is the air that you’re flying in – this jelly right here. ‘And this napkin is the aeroplane, and that is you flying through the sky, there’s pressure from the bottom, there’s pressure from the top, and from the sides. ‘There’s pressure coming from everywhere. And now, when there’s turbulence, it’s like this…’ She then taps the pot, showing how the jelly shakes but the napkin, which she’s suspended in the jelly, doesn’t fall any lower in the pot. She says: ‘You feel the plane shaking, but this is not just going to fall down. ‘It’s stuck in there because there’s pressure coming from the bottom and the sides. This is what turbulence is. ‘So, you can chill there – you’re wiggling in jelly – it’s not going to automatically fall just because it’s shaking. ‘There has never been a plane crash from turbulence, so you don’t have to be scared, OK? ‘When you’re in a plane, and you feel turbulence – imagine yourself in jelly like this – and know that you can’t just fall, it’s stuck. There are some sceptics in the comments, but mostly people have posted messages of thanks for sharing this tip. One person wrote: ‘Omg that’s so smart never thought of that before,’ while another said: ‘Another pilot told me it’s comparable to a pothole or bump in the road when ur driving’. Someone else quipped: ‘IDK… I looked out my window and saw no jelly.’ Do you have a story to share?
