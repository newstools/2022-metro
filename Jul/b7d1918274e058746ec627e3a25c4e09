Panic spread across the nation last month as a shortage of Cadbury Flakes threatened the distribution of Mr Whippy 99s everywhere. Luckily, one TikTokker has found a way to make the perfect dupe for Mr Whippy’s creamy vanilla ice-cream – with just two ingredients. All you need is double cream, condensed milk and a whisk. ‘Rumour has it you can make Mr Whippy ice-cream with double cream and condensed milk, so obviously I’m going to give this ago,’ said Emma Ord. In a video that has now been watched 2million times, Emma adds a full tub of Elmlea double cream to a bowl before whisking it with an electric whisk. Once it had thickened up, she added a full tin of condensed milk – although you don’t need to use the full can. She then layered up the cream concoction with chocolate drops in a tall tub before storing it in the freezer. The next day, she posted a taste test saying the ice-cream was a success. ‘It is absolutely amazing,’ says Emma. ‘It doesn’t go rock hard and it tastes the exact same as Mr Whippy.’ Best of all, the whole tub only cost £2.10 – these days, that’s less than a singular Mr Whippy cone from the local ice-cream van.
