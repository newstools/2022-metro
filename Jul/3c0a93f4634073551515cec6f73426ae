A leaked copy of an estimate for renovations at Boris Johnson’s Downing Street flat shows he had some extravagant plans for the place. Items on the list – in excess of £200,000 – include the infamous ‘hand-crafted’ gold wallpaper, said to have cost a total of £2,250. Other items suggested by designer Lulu Lytle included a £500 tablecloth, a £3,675 drinks trolley, a £7,000 rug and two sofas costing more than £15,000. A £3,000 ‘paint effect’ for the hallway of the Number 11 flat was also on the list of options for the Prime Minister and his wife Carrie Johnson. Building works including painting, decorating, sanding the floorboards and new furnishings, were quoted at £30,000, the Independent reports. The makeover is thought to have been inspired by Mrs Johnson’s desire to remove the ‘John Lewis furniture nightmare’ left by her husband’s predecessor, Theresa May. Around the time, the PM was reported to have privately told aides the refurbishment was ‘out of control’. The estimate was sent in 2020 to the Cabinet Office, which allocates an annual allowance of £30,000 to renovate the PM’s living quarters. Not all of the suggested works were taken up, and in the end the project cost £112,549 inclusive of VAT. Downing Street at the time said the additional expenses beyond the annual allowance had been met by Mr Johnson personally. No 10 insisted Conservative Party funds had not been used, but it later emerged more than £50,000 had been provided by Tory donor, Lord Brownlow. The PM eventually settled all the costs himself including those paid for by the 57-year-old peer. Upholstery and curtains on the leaked list was quoted as costing more than £21,000. The document, sent by interior designer Lulu Lytle’s Soane Britain company, lists 10 rolls of Espalier Square Wallpaper costing £225 each. It also included 15 rolls of another variety of wallpaper costing £55 and eight upholstered dining chairs costing £1,410 each. A drawing room lamp cost £6,000 – with an extra £2,500 for the lampshade. An antique chair had a price-tag of £4,200, while a hanging light was quoted at £4,465. Mr Johnson apologised in January for failing to disclose messages between himself and Lord Brownlow to Whitehall ethics advisor, Lord Geidt – who quit in June after expressing his ‘frustration’ over partygate. Wallpapergate is just one of a string of scandals which engulfed Downing Street and set the wheels in motion for Mr Johnson’s downfall. He was amatically resigned yesterday when almost 60 MPs turned against him in a brutal rebellion. The Johnsons’ lavish spending has sparked fury as millions have been forced to choose between heating and eating during the cost of living crisis.
