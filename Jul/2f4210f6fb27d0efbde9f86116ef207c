Huge speculation surrounds the future of Boris Johnson’s leadership after a day of yet more government drama. Last night’s resignations of Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid have led to a further wave of departures today. Ministers have stood down and MPs have withdrawn their confidence over Mr Johnson’s handling of the Pincher scandal. Members of the prime minister’s own cabinet are currently meeting in No 10, reportedly to tell the party leader to step down. As Mr Johnson insists he is ‘not going to step down’, members of his own party maintain otherwise. Andrew Murrison, MP for South West Wiltshire, described today as ‘endgame’ for the prime minister. Yesterday, the internet turned to humour to diffuse some of the tension surrounding the government’s ‘slow collapse’. Today, similar memes and Tweets have taken over the web as people now speculate when, not if, Mr Johnson will resign. Here’s a selection of our favourites for you to enjoy.
