Costeen Hatzi has shared her pride in boyfriend Nick Kyrgios as the Aussie faces Novak Djokovic in the men’s final at Wimbledon today. Kyrgios – the current world no 40 – is enjoying his best-ever run at a Grand Slam and has reached his first final, where he faces six-time champion, Djokovic, at today’s Championships, with the Serbian looking to add a fourth-straight trophy at SW19 to his 20 major titles. Throughout his Wimbledon campaign, while Aussie athlete Kyrgios has played some exceptional tennis he’s also made headlines for all the wrong reasons with several arguments with umpires and line judges, falling out with players and spitting towards the crowd. Last week 27-year-old was also charged with assault following an incident involving his ex-girlfriend Chiara Passari which allegedly occurred in December 2021. Barrister Jason Moffett confirmed that Kyrgios was aware of the charge and will not comment on it at this stage. Hatzi has remained by her boyfriend’s side throughout the Championships, cheering on Kygrios from the stands while also sharing her love of the tennis player on social media. In a message shared moments before he took to the court on Sunday, Hatzi was seen cosying up to Kyrgios with tennis courts seen in the background. She wrote: ‘The big day. Words cannot explain how proud I am of you. ‘You are supported by so many and you never fail to show how talented, entertaining and resilient you are. Finals at Wimbledon, that is a huge achievement in itself. ‘Your hard work and dedication is paying off. I am so lucky to be on this journey with you 🤍 Let’s do this !!!!!!’ Kyrgios himself has shared tributes to his girlfriend, previously musing: ‘My beautiful Costeen, the most amazing person I’ve ever met. You’ve been the biggest blessing in my life and I’m so incredibly thankful that I get to call you my best friend. ‘No matter what we do, I always get excited because I know that we are going to make every little moment enjoyable. There is nothing I love more than being able to make you laugh and seeing that amazing smile of yours. ‘I’m so incredibly proud of how far we have come, and now to say we have a home together. I cannot wait for all our adventures, big or small, or around the world.’ Kyrgios made it through to the final after Rafael Nadal was forced to withdraw from his semi-final game with the Australian, meaning Kyrgios got a bye into the men’s singles final. The Spaniard has an abdominal injury which he was struggling with during his quarter-final victory on Wednesday and it has proved too much for him to continue at SW19.
