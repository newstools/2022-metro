A dog that was clearly suffering heatstroke has been saved by staff at Primark and a passer by who noticed something was wrong. The owner had taken the bulldog out on in Basildon, Essex, on Monday afternoon when temperatures hit 35°C. A witness said: ‘I was walking through the town centre and at first sight, I thought it was someone who had collapsed, but as I got nearer, it became clearer it was a dog. ‘I went into Primark and asked one of the staff if we could get the dog into their door entrance so she could have half a chance of survival. ‘With that, the staff member spoke to the manager who was amazing and assisted to get a trolley and load the dog on so the dog could be transported back to the owner’s flat.’ She added she filmed the incident because she wanted to highlight how quickly dogs can get to a critical stage in hot conditions. On Monday, another dog was left trapped in a vehicle as temperatures rose. Metropolitan Police smashed through the window to get the animal out at The Royal Air Force Museum in Hendon – as the area hit 31.5°C. Officers from the North West Basic Command Unit slammed the situation as ‘unbelievable’ on social media. Writing in capital letters to express their anger, they put: ‘JUST DON’T TAKE DOGS OUT IN THIS HEAT.’ Just hours before the same police department had issued a warning, saying: ‘Never leave your dog alone in a car on a warm day. #DogsDieInHotCars’. Writing on Twitter, they had posted a link to a page on the RSPCA website offering advice on what to do if you see a dog in a car on a warm day.
