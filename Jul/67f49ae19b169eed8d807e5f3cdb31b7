Around 100 firefighters are battling a blaze at a block of flats in South East London. Footage posted on social media showed flames bursting through the roof of a residential building in Bromley. A London Fire Brigade spokesperson said the fire started on the 15th floor of the 17-storey building. They said ‘half of a five room flat’ was ablaze shortly before noon. Images from the scene showed firefighters spraying water up the building’s distinctive incline from balconies on lower floors. Other residents further down the building could be soon watching from their balconies while a thick column of smoke rose over the area. Twelve fire engines were sent to St Mark’s Square after dozens of calls about the fire flooded in to 999. Fire crews from Bromley, Beckenham, Addington, Woodside, Lewisham, Forest Hill, Sidcup and Croydon had to be drafted in. Station commander Colin Digby said: ‘Crews are making steady progress. ‘This is going to be a protracted incident and we expect our crews to be on scene for several hours to come.’ It’s unclear how the fire started at this stage. Around 120 people had to evacuated from the building and no injuries have been reported. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
