Noah Schnapp has revealed he apologised to Doja Cat and cleared the air with her after he shared DMs she had sent him. The Stranger Things star, 17, had come under fire from 26-year-old Doja – whose real name is Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini – after he shared messages she had sent him privately asking him to set her up with his co-star. She had messaged Noah, who plays Will Byers in the hit Netflix show, asking him to put her in touch with Joseph Quinn, 29, who plays Eddie Munson. The Need To Know star had messaged him: ‘Noah can you tell Joseph to hit me up,’ before adding: ‘Wait no. does he have a gf [girlfriend]?’ Noah then replied: ‘LMAOO slide into his dms,’ to which Doja wrote: ‘idk [I don’t know] his IG or Twitter. Doesn’t have a DM to slide in,’ before Noah sent her his page. He had then shared the messages on TikTok, which led to Doja calling him out for posting them without her agreement. While things had been a tad awkward after Doja called him out publicly, Noah has since assured fans that things have been sorted between the two of them. Noah shared a new TikTok video of him doing quick maths using a filter, set to Doja’s song Kiss Me More, as he clarified in the caption: ‘Guys everything is all good I apologised and I still follow her and love her music no hard feelings.’ Doja had lost over 200,000 followers after publicly calling out Noah on Instagram Live, telling her followers: ‘I think that, to be fair, first let’s be chill about it. Like Noah is a kid, but, I don’t even know how old he is, but he’s not even over – like there’s no way he’s over 21. ’But when you’re that young, you make mistakes. You do dumb s**t. I’m like trying to be super fair. You do dumb s**t, you say dumb s**t, you f**king f**k up relationships with people. You make mistakes. ‘You’re supposed so that you know you’re not to do that in the future. I did my share of f**k ups so that I don’t f**k up again.’ The Say So star revealed that she was hurt by what happened, adding: ‘The fact that Noah did that, like went and posted a private conversation between me and him is so unbelievably socially unaware and whack. ‘That’s like borderline snake s**t, that’s like weasel s**t. And I’m not saying that encapsulates his entire personality – like I don’t imagine Noah that way. ‘Maybe he is, like a whole snake. But I didn’t see him that way. I made an assumption that he was gonna be chill about it and he went and shared information that I didn’t feel comfortable with him sharing.’ According to social media analytics company Social Blade, Doja’s rant resulted in a drop of Instagram followers on her account from 24.34million to 24.14million, while Noah’s following on the other hand has skyrocketed from 24.25million to 25.5million.
