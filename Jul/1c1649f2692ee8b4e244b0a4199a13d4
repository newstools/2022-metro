Some new afternoon tea parties are launching in London this week – but with a chilled twist. Just in time for the heatwave, these cold afternoon teas will take place at London’s Secret Garden in South Kensington from July 12-14 – between 2pm and 5pm. Guests can enjoy all the afternoon tea classics – such as biscuits, sandwiches, cakes and prosecco – as well as cold brew tea. The events are being organised by Whittard of Chelsea – to mark the launch of their new cold brew tea range. Some cold tea options include a passionfruit, mango and peach variety, a watermelon, strawberry and lime option, a blackcurrant and blueberry flavour, and a passionfruit and pink grapefruit one. And they have been specially formulated to infuse in cold water. Plus, visitors will be dining within igloos in keeping with the chilled theme. If you’re interested in attending these tea parties, 1.5 hour slots can be booked online – and guests will also receive a complimentary goodie bag. Do you have a story to share?
