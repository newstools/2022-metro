Long, voluminous, natural lashes may seem like a myth to many – but a new makeup hack going viral on TikTok is set to change things. If mascara alone just doesn’t cut it, and you’re done with lash extensions and falsies, you might want to add some extra steps to your mascara application process. In a video that now has 17.3million views on TikTok, makeup artist Andreea Pletea used concealer and translucent powder on her lashes before applying mascara, and the results were genuinely dramatic. The concealer and powder essentially work as a lash primer. ‘While the concealer offers pigmentation, the powder is a thickening agent, which is why your lashes will look fuller,’ makeup artist Harriet Harmon tells Metro.co.uk. However, Harriet adds that it likely depends what powder you use, and she recommends using a pigmented powder rather than a translucent powder. ‘It definitely works, but the results might not be as dramatic if there’s no pigment in your powder,’ she adds. Though some commenters noted that this trick was likely to dry out your mascara, rendering it clumpy and unusable, others recommend combatting this by adding eye drops to your mascara. ‘I do it all the time,’ wrote one person. Otherwise, you can use a separate mascara brush or eyebrow spoolie to apply the concealer and powder before switching over to your mascara wand. Do you have a story to share?
