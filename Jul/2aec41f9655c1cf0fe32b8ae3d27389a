Rhod Gilbert has revealed he is undergoing treatment for cancer, as he thanked the ‘inspirational’ NHS staff looking after him. The comedian, 53, shared photos from the Velindre Cancer Centre in Cardiff on Facebook and wrote: ‘As a proud patron of Velindre Cancer Centre, I’ve trekked the world, hosted chaotic quizzes and star-studded comedy nights. ‘I’ve met and made friends with so many inspirational staff, patients and their families. It has been a huge part of my life for the last ten years. ‘So while I never imagined that I would be a patient here, I know better than anyone that I am in the best possible hands. The NHS care I’m receiving is incredible. ‘I wouldn’t wish this on anyone…but who knows, maybe I’ll come out the other end with a new stand-up show and a 40 minute rant about orange squash. ‘Thank you everyone for your support over the last few weeks and months (and years). I’ll be disappearing for a while and won’t be commenting further, at least not for now, whilst I focus on my recovery. ‘Rhod x’. Fans have sent plenty of well-wishes to Rhod for his recovery.
