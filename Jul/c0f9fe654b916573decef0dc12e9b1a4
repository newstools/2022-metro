Britney Spears found a way to survive the scorching heatwave in the UK this week – by prancing around naked in her London hotel room. The Slave 4 U singer is fresh from her honeymoon with husband Sam Asghari after the pair tied the knot at their home in California last month. Ringing in the first days of their married life, Britney, 40, and Sam, 28, spent weeks ‘island hopping’ around tropical destinations, including Cabo, Mexico. It appears the honeymoon has officially come to an end but Britney hasn’t given up the jetset lifestyle just yet, as she’s popped up in London for reasons unknown. Waking up her Instagram followers, the Toxic singer shared a set of photos of her posing around the hotel room completely nude in some, and wearing green bikini bottoms in another. One snap shows the star standing with her back towards the camera with flower and heart emoji covering her modesty. Alongside another snap, Britney wrote: ‘Waking up in London 🇬🇧 with my Cabo thong 🙈 !!!’ Making herself at home, she added beside another: ‘Not sure … tea 🫖 or coffee ☕️🤔 ???? I held my phone up with a book and a remote control to shoot this ….🙈’ Another caption read: ‘ALRIGHT ALRIGHT ALRIGHT 🌹🌹🌹’ Some fans were loving Britney’s quirky shoot, including one who commented: ‘London Britney is always a vibe !!🔥😍’ It appears to be Britney’s first visit to the UK in several years with the singer taking a hiatus from music in 2018 to focus on her mental health and amid her conservatorship battle, which ended last year when a judge terminated the restrictive order after 13 years. Britney’s husband Sam hasn’t revealed if he has joined her on the trip across the pond, but was last seen working out in the gym on his Instagram stories and sharing a photo of a cloudy sky. The couple began dating in 2016 and tied the knot in front of a small group of friends, including Madonna, Paris Hilton and Selena Gomez, at her home in June. Got a story?
