Christian Eriksen has verbally agreed to join Manchester United. The Denmark international is a free agent after his contract at Brentford expired at the end of June. While the Bees had hoped to keep him in the capital, The Athletic now report Eriksen has informed United he wants to join them and is prepared to accept their offer of a three-year contract. A contract for the 30-year-old is now being drafted. Erik ten Hag has been eager to bring in the former Tottenham star, identifying him and Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong as key components to his Old Trafford rebuild this summer. Eriksen will also undergo a standard medical with the club and while no problems are anticipated, it is still a ‘significant hurdle that needs to be navigated’ owing to his medical history. Eriksen collapsed on the pitch during a Euro 2020 clash last summer, suffering a cardiac arrest that left his future in the sport in major doubt. He was released by Inter Milan late last year after being fitted with a implantable cardioverter-defibrillator with Serie A regulations preventing players from competing under such circumstances. After joining Brentford in January, Eriksen enjoyed a superb second-half of the 2021-22 season where the Bees comfortably avoided relegation with the Dane key to that run of form. United will hope to wrap up a deal before they depart for their tour of Asia and Australia on Friday. A deal for Tyrell Malacia is expected to be confirmed before then with the 22-year-old arriving from Feyenoord in a £13m deal.
