Apple’s latest and greatest 13-inch MacBook Pro was revealed alongside a redesigned MacBook Air at the company’s developer conference last month. The key selling point was the addition of Apple’s new M2 silicon chip, which Apple said increased the performance over the last model. But according to a teardown of the machine performed by iFixit, that’s the only thing that’s changed. After gutting Apple’s latest laptop (which starts at £1,349), the site found that while the processor is indeed new and powerful – everything else is identical to the 2020 M1 version. The casing, connections, keyboard, screen are all unchanged. In fact, the iFixit video makes it clear that all the cables, stand-offs, screws, grounding pins are also all the same. The only difference is a new logic board and some tweaks to the heat-sink to fit in the new processor. Amazingly, while the processor is a step up in terms of power, the base level 2022 M2 MacBook Pro actually has slower storage than its predecessor due to a different configuration of the SSD. Although the only upgrade was the processor, Apple still added a subtle price hike for the new machine. Apple’s M1 MacBook Pro launched at £1,299 in 2020 whereas the latest version goes on sale now starting at £1,349.
