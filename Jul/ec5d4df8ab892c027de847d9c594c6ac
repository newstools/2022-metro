Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s mansion has been targeted by intruders twice in the space of 12 days, a report says. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and their two young children Archie and Lilibet, were believed to be at their £11 million home in Montecito when the alarms were triggered. Santa Barbara Police records show officers visited the home on May 19 at 5.44pm, The Sun reports. The royal couple would have been celebrating their fourth wedding anniversary at the time. Less than two weeks later, police responded to a second intruder alert on May 31 at 3.21pm. It was around the same time the family left California to attend the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations in London. Both calls in May were logged as ‘trespasser’, ‘property crimes’ and ‘suspicious circumstances’. According to police records, there have been six security alert calls to the home in the past 14 months. After ‘couch surfing’ for several months after quitting their royal duties, Harry and Meghan moved into the Montecito mansion – officially known as Chateau of River Rock – in June 2020. Their neighbours include Oprah Winfrey, Tom Cruise, and Ellen Degeneres. Before their move, the pair used to live in Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, which they loaned to Princess Eugenie and her little family until recently. Since moving to the US, the Sussexes employed Barack Obama’s ex-bodyguard Christopher Sanchez and Michael Jackson’s former security chief Alberto Alvarez. Reporters of intruders in their home come just days after Harry won the first stage in a fight with the Home Office to give him full police protection when he visits Britain.
