This is the shocking moment a BMW driver mounted the kerb and drove on the pavement to avoid waiting at a red light. Dashcam footage shows the ‘crazy’ motorist speeding past vehicles stuck in the queue of traffic. The incident happened near a primary school in Southampton, with one gobsmacked witness who filmed it saying ‘it was lucky nobody was hurt’. Moments later, a pregnant woman and another with a pushchair walked past him. ‘I was on my way to my daughter’s school where she has swimming lessons when I witnessed this crazy driver going up on the pavement,’ he recalled. ‘He wasn’t behind me when I was driving, he just suddenly appeared. ‘We walk that route regularly and with kids the little ones often run ahead so you just dread to think. ‘To be honest, it’s just a matter of timing that someone wasn’t hurt and this wasn’t a lot more serious. ‘It’s not something you expect when you are walking along a pavement and a car comes the other way is it? ‘I don’t know what would possess someone to do that, it’s not like we even had to wait that long at the lights.’ According to research from 2016 from comparison website Confused.com, motorists spend the equivalent of two days a year sitting at red traffic lights. On average they lose eight minutes a day waiting for green, with nearly a fifth stuck for 15 minutes. It is yet unclear why the BMW driver decided to skip the traffic queue and how many cars he drove past. But their actions cannot be helpful to the stereotype that owners of that brand are supposedly obnoxious and self-important. Hampshire Police have confirmed the incident is being investigated.
