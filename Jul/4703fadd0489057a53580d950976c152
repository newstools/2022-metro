This is the moment two women get into a nasty brawl in front of horrified shoppers at Primark’s flagship Birmingham store. Footage shows the pair rolling around the floor and swapping blows after the fight broke out on July 9. The woman in the black top pinned her opponent to the ground and repeatedly said: ‘Let go, and I’ll let go of you’. She was later heard verbally abusing the woman while her friends laughed in the background. The clip has since gone viral on social media over the weekend and has been shared hundreds of times. It is still not clear how the fight started, but police have said the incident was dealt with by security. West Midlands Police told Metro.co.uk: ‘We are aware of a video circulating on social media of a fight in Primark in Birmingham city centre on Friday (8 July). ‘The incident was dealt with by store management and store security. ‘While we haven’t received any formal reports, officers are looking into this and we ask anyone with any more information to please contact us via Live Chat.’ A spokesperson for Primark said: ‘We are aware of an incident that took place between two customers in our store on Friday. ‘The incident was dealt with swiftly by store management and store security.’ It’s not the first time Primark security have had to deal with all hell breaking loose. Footage from 2018 shows a man being beaten up by a member of staff in a black and blue uniform outside a Primark store in Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire. A customer could be seen arguing with a member of staff and three other men in white shirts and ties. Seconds later they begin shoving each other, before the row erupts in a burst of blows.
