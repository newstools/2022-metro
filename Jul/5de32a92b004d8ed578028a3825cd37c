The disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell has launched appeals against her conviction and sentence for sex trafficking young girls. The 60-year-old was sentenced to 20 years in prison last month after being found guilty by jury of luring young girls into massage rooms to be abused by former financier Jeffrey Epstein between 1994 and 2004. Maxwell’s defence attorneys had indicated they would be appealing against the conviction after it emerged one of the jurors in her trial had failed to disclose he had been sexually abused. But in a written ruling, Judge Alison Nathan said the jury’s guilty verdicts were ‘readily supported’ by witness testimony and documentary evidence as Maxwell’s bid to overturn the conviction was dismissed. Prosecutors described Maxwell as ‘dangerous’ during her three week trial, as jurors learnt how she used to lure the young girls to Epstein for him to sexually abuse them. Judge Nathan went on to say it was important that although ‘Epstein was central to this scheme’ she was not being sentenced ‘as a proxy’ for him. She said: ‘The defendant’s conduct… was heinous and predatory. ‘Ms Maxwell worked with Epstein to select young victims who were vulnerable and played a pivotal role in facilitating sexual abuse.’ Maxwell has been imprisoned since July 2020.
