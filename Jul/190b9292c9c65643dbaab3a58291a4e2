A six-month old baby has died in a car crash and a woman has been arrested for a number of driving offences. The emergency services were scrambled to Cherry Tree Avenue in Clacton, Essex, at 6.45pm yesterday. They rushed the little boy to hospital but he could not be saved and died from his injuries. A female passenger was also left with minor injuries. The other woman, who is unrelated to the baby, was arrested for allegedly causing death by dangerous driving. She was released on bail until next month. After launching their investigation, a police spokesperson said: ‘We need anyone with CCTV, dash cam or other footage in relation to this incident, to get in contact with us as soon as possible.’ The baby’s family are being supported by specialist officers at Essex Police.
