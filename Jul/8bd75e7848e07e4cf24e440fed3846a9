Victoria Beckham is really sticking it to the haters as she celebrates her 23rd wedding anniversary with David today – by smiling, of all things. We know, this is groundbreaking stuff. The star, 48, who is known for her famously serious expression in photos, took the mick out of herself, her husband and their marriage, in the ultimate trifecta of trolling on their day of days. Yes, we can hardly believe it’s been 23 years since the iconic couple – who share four children, Brooklyn, 23, Romeo, 19, Cruz, 17, and Harper, 10 – tied the knot in a grandiose 1999 wedding only threatened in its lavishness by son Brooklyn’s recent wedding to Nicola Peltz (but they didn’t sit on thrones and wear crowns, so they don’t win). In celebration of their anniversary, Victoria leaned into the trolling that’s been lobbed their way throughout their lengthy marriage, and poked fun at her own lack of grin – which has been a hot topic since she blast to fame as part of the Spice Girls in the 90s. In a ravishing shot of her alongside David, 47, at an event, Victoria was seen with a giant smile plastered across her face, as she wrote in the caption: ‘They say he isn’t funny, they say I never smile, they said it wouldn’t last 😂 ‘Today we celebrate 23 years being married. David you are my everything, I love you so much!!!! 💕’ Meanwhile, over on his own page, David shared a tribute to his wife, with a throwback to rival all throwbacks (alongside some other throwback images, because who doesn’t love a spot of nostalgia?). Victoria and Becks were seen chatting with Sacha Baron Cohen’s Ali G in the 90s when the comedian asked if David was into the Spice Girls when they first met, with the footballer replying: ‘No but I was into Posh’. He added in the caption: ’23 years ago today Posh became Mrs Beckham , but she will always be Posh ❤️ ‘Happy Anniversary WOW 23 years & 4 beautiful kiddies ❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love you , we all love you ❤️.’ Romeo Beckham shared a gorgeous tribute to his parents, writing: ‘Happy anniversary to the best parents in the world, I love you so much.’ Posh and Becks started dating in 1997 after meeting at a Manchester United match and tied the knot on July 4 1999 at Luttrellstown Castle in Ireland, with Gary Neville as the best man and their then-baby son Brooklyn as the ring bearer. It was reported that their wedding had 437 members of staff fussing over their guests and cost a staggering £500,000. It’s no surprise the cost was sky-high though, given the pair spared no expense, even having an outfit change for the evening reception, donning their now-famous all-purple ensembles while cutting their wedding cake with a sword. At least when it comes to cost per wear, 23 years on they’re really getting their money’s worth out of that wedding, non?
