Life-support treatment keeping a brain-damaged boy alive can lawfully be stopped, a High Court judge has ruled. Doctors treating Archie Battersbee, 12, at the Royal London Hospital say he is ‘brain-stem dead’ and will not recover. But Archie’s parents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, disagree, and say his heart is still beating. Mr Justice Hayden reviewed evidence at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court earlier this week, and concluded that ending Archie’s treatment was in his best interests. Archie suffered a ‘devastating’ brain injury on April 7. His mother found him unconscious with a ligature over his head and thinks he might have been taking part in an online challenge. He has not regained consciousness. Mr Justice Hayden described what happened to Archie as a ‘tragedy of immeasurable dimensions’, but the medical evidence was ‘compelling and unanimous’, and painted a ‘bleak’ picture. The judge said evidence showed Archie had suffered a ‘significant injury’ to ‘multiple areas’ of his brain and had not ‘regained awareness at any time’. ‘Archie’s mother described him as a fighter and I have no doubt he was,’ he said. ‘But the fight, if it can properly be characterised as such, is no longer in Archie’s control. ‘The damage to his brain has deprived him of any bodily autonomy. Eventually Archie’s organs will fail and ultimately his heart will stop.’ Another High Court judge, Mrs Justice Arbuthnot, had earlier concluded that Archie was dead. But the Court of Appeal upheld a challenge, made by Archie’s parents, for another judge to review the evidence. Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
