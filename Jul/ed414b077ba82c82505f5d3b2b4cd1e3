Well, if you thought Boris Johnson brought all the chaos this week then think again – tonight’s Love Island has been extended due to the most ‘dramatic Casa Amor recoupling ever’. What a time to be alive. Last night’s Love Island concluded with Laura Whitmore stumbling into the villa to announce to the boys that the time had come to either stick in their current coupling or switch if their head had been turned by one of the new bombshells. Considering all the boys have had their heads turned in order to ‘test their relationships’ as if that makes any sense at all, it’s going to be a corker. ‘It’s one of the best episodes of Love Island ever filmed,’ an insider told The Sun. ‘It’s really explosive – viewers will be shocked at how much drama kicks off tonight. ‘There are tears, rows, heartbreak. In eight series, there has never been a more explosive show. ‘Fans should cancel plans to stay in and watch – it’s that good.’ While we count down the seconds for tonight’s episode, we do know Jay Young kicks off proceedings, almost a dead cert to couple up with Summer Botwe instead of Danica Taylor. Danica will no doubt couple up with Josh Le Grove, Luca Bish will stick with Gemma Owen and after that everything is about to hit the fan. This time tomorrow we won’t even remember what a Boris Johnson is. Love Island continues 9pm at ITV2. Got a story?
