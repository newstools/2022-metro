Gemma Owen’s mother has admitted Luca Bish’s behaviour towards Tasha Ghouri in Love Island has become ‘close to bullying’. Luca and Dami Hope have both come under fire from Love Island viewers after they both targeted Tasha during several challenges, bringing her to tears. During last night’s episode both boys apologised to the dancer but viewers were convinced they’d been given a nudge by producers. Now Gemma’s mum Louise – who will be entering the villa to meet Luca over the coming days – has shared her verdict on the uncomfortable scenes which have taken this Love Island from being the best ever, to becoming a toxic mess Commenting on a clip of Tasha asking Andrew to be her boyfriend, Louise wrote: ‘I hope Tasha is ok, I feel it’s close to bullying now which is so sad to see.’ Louise isn’t the only one who’s been offended by Luca since his fall from grace after Mad Movies. Even before his remarks to Tasha, Luca manged to spark over 3,000 Ofcom complaints for getting the hump with Gemma over a clip which showed her not flirting with Billy Brown. ‘I don’t even want to talk to her tonight,’ he kicked off. ‘Made me look like an absolute f*****g w****r  I ain’t going f*****g near that bird.’ Luca’s family have urged his critics to stop sending them vile messages and apologised for his ‘insensitive reaction’ to the clips. His Love Island cast mates who have left the villa have also been in contact with his family to assure that he was a ‘lovely, genuine friend’. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2.
