Sir Andy Murray has shared his heartbreak after the death of his dog, Maggie. The tennis legend and Olympic gold medalist crashed out of Wimbledon 2022 last month despite a seriously promising start, to the disappointment of British fans. Now the father-of-four has suffered another blow after the family’s beloved dog died. Sir Andy took to Instagram on Saturday to break the sad news, admitting Maggie’s death ‘really hurts.’ Sharing a snap of him cuddling the little terrier mix, he wrote: ‘Today or our family said goodbye to this amazing little dog (sic).’ ‘She was a huge part of our family and our first pet so this really hurts.’ Adding a broken-heart emoji, he urged his followers to ‘give your pets a big cuddle tonight cause it stings when you can’t anymore.’ The star then addressed the pup directly, writing: ‘Thanks Maggie Mayhem you were an absolute star ⭐️ ❤️.’ Many animal lovers know the unique heartbreak that comes with the death of a much-loved pet, particularly a family dog who has lived a long life, and Sir Andy and his family were inundated with messages of support. Golfing star Jessica Korda offered her condolences in the comment section, writing: ‘They’re the absolute best 🤍 so sorry for your loss 💔.’ Fellow Tenis legend Sabine Lisicki said: ‘So sorry for your loss. Dogs are the best. We don’t deserve their Love ❤️.’ And friend and TV chef Rukmini Iyer added: ‘Oh no! That’s so sad, I am very sorry for your loss. ‘She must have had a wonderful life with you and your family, though nothing will make this any easier. Sending thoughts ✨’ Sir Andy, 35, recently vowed to try and return to Wimbledon next year but admitted it is ‘extremely difficult’ to compete at the top level after sustaining injuries inver the years. The sporting legend has twice undergone major hip operations to prolong his time at the summit of his sport, and also carried an abdominal injury into this month’s competition in London. He insisted he wants to compete again next year, but admitted ‘It depends on how I am physically, [if] physically I feel good, then we’ll try to keep playing. ‘But it’s extremely difficult with the problems I’ve had with my body in the last few years to make long-term predictions about how I’m going to be even in a few weeks, never mind in a year’s time. ‘If physically I’m in a good place, yeah, I will continue to play. But it’s not easy to keep my body in optimal condition to compete at the highest level.’ Britain suffered another defeat in the 2022 competition when US Opoen champion Emma Raducanu crashed out following a straight sets defeat to Caroline Garcia.
