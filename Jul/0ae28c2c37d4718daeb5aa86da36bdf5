Ola Jordan has admitted her husband James pokes fun at her ‘mum bod’ after she shared her bikini snap – but it’s all in jest. The former Strictly Come Dancing star admits she and her fellow pro – whom she married in 2003 – aren’t in the same shape they were in their ballroom prime, but she joked while she’s had a baby her man has no excuse. She told the MailOnline: ‘You know what James is like – he’s always taking the mickey. He jokes I’m not the woman he married but then I say to him – what about you and your big belly?! ‘But obviously we don’t really mean it – much! I know he loves me whatever size I am but let’s face it neither of us look in Strictly shape do we – so we’ve got matching mum and dad bods now!’ The 39-year-old star admitted she was ‘absolutely horrified’ and ‘mortified’ when she saw the photo, which was taken by a friend, but she is learning to be less critical of herself. ‘You know what it’s like, if you’ve put on a bit of weight, you hide away in baggy clothes and avoid looking in full Iength mirrors! So this was a bit of a shock,’ she said. ‘But I thought – you know what I’ve had a baby and no I don’t look like I did in my time on Strictly – but I’m not dancing for six hours a day.’ The couple have two-year-old daughter Ella together, and Ola admitted her priorities have changed since giving birth, and she’s no longer as focused on her diet and figure. ‘And definitely since having Ella my priorities have changed – she is my number one priority now. So I have better things to think about than a 24 inch waist,’ she said. ‘I’m not alone – I’ve had a baby. What’s James’s excuse?’ This week, Ola shared the photo of them both on Instagram and admitted she was ‘horrified’ by her changing figure and wanted to ‘motivate’ herself. ‘I wasn’t going to post this picture but I’ve decided to because I’m horrified and so disappointed with myself and by posting it I’m hoping it will help motivate me to do something about it,’ she wrote on Instagram. ‘We know we’re not in our best Strictly shape but hey that’s what happens when you stop dancing for hours every day and have a baby (I just want to know James’ excuse) ☺️ Stay cool everyone 😎 I think I need to avoid the ice cream for a while!!! 🙈.’ Got a story?
