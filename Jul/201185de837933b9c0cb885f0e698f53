A gaggle of 15 orphaned ducklings have found a new caretaker – a sweet dog called Fred. The baby ducks were left alone after their mother suddenly disappeared overnight from Mountfitchet Castle, Essex. Thankfully, Fred was on-hand to make sure his sunshine yellow foster children are OK. Pictures show him letting them cuddle up to him, and even carrying them around on his back. This isn’t the first time the Golden Lab has made headlines for adopting a brood of birds. Lovely Fred adopted nine orphaned ducklings when he was ten years old in 2018. The plan is for his new brood to stay with him at the castle until they’re old enough to take care of themselves. Fred’s owner Jeremy Goldsmith says he’s not surprised the dog has found a new flock. He said: ‘Over the 15 years of owning him, Fred has spent a lot of time at the Castle with the animals. ‘It has become second nature to him to be amongst the various rescued animals.’ Do you have a story to share?
