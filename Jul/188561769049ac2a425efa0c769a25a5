A widower only has one remaining picture of his late wife after a wildfire burned his house down – it’s a tattoo on his left arm. Keith and Olwen Gant lived in their Norfolk home for three decades before she died aged 64 in 2019. As the mercury soared to almost 40°C on Tuesday, a huge fire in the village of Ashmanhaugh spread to his street. The home where they both made ‘a lot of memories’ was engulfed in flames within minutes. ‘My wife and I had a lot of happy days here,’ he told ITV Anglia. ‘Everything is gone.’ Mr Gant was watching TV with his blinds drawn when the fire took hold, and only realised it was ablaze when the smoke alarm sounded.  ‘Smoke was blowing and flames were up the trees,’ he said. The flames melted the windows, completely gutted the roof and, tragically, every photograph of Olwen was destroyed. Mr Gant was among dozens of homeowners who lost everything in the fires this week. There were 280 fires in Norfolk alone on Tuesday, while at least eight UK fire and rescue services declared major incidents as the flames ripped through houses, schools and churches. The London Fire Brigade confirmed it was their busiest day since the Second World War after 41 homes in the capital were destroyed.
