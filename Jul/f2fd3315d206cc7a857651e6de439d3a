Two people including a seven-year-old boy have died after a boat capsized on the Hudson River in New York City. A boat completely tipped over around 2.45pm on Tuesday near Pier 84, according to the New York Police Department. Police and fire personnel pulled two people out of the water, and attended to a dozen people total, according to ABC 7. The boy and a 50-year-old woman got trapped underneath the boat and were killed, officials said. Two other people including the captain of the boat were in critical condition. Another person was in critical but stable condition, and six others were in stable condition. Some passengers suffered minor injures and declined medical assistance at the scene. The New York Waterway Ferry operator stated that it ‘responded to an emergency when a private boat overturned in the Hudson River, just north of the Pier 79 Midtown ferry terminal’. ‘Two NY Waterway ferries, the Garden State and the John Stevens, arrived on the scene and their crews rescued 9 passengers from the private boat,’ the operator said. The boating accident occurred in front of the Intrepid. Iaidy Garcia, 28, said he was on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River when he heard people shouting for help. ‘I saw people screaming in the water, and then I just called 911 to just make sure they were okay,’ Garcia told the New York Post. Mayor Eric Adams, who was nearby promoting a recent renovation of the Hudson Street streetscape, went to the scene after reports of the accident, according to his office.
