Bayern Munich have reiterated that they will not sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United after reaching an agreement to sell Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona. After several weeks of negotiations, the Spanish club have finally secured a €50 million (£42m) deal to bring Lewandowski to Camp Nou. Bayern’s CEO, Oliver Kahn, told Bild on Saturday: ‘In the end, Barcelona offered a sum that selling him made absolute sense for us. ‘We’ve also recently been very successful on the transfer market and signed an absolutely world-class player for the offence in Sadio Mane. So we have now reached an agreement with Barcelona. ‘So far, however, only verbally, the contract is still pending.’ Bayern, who have already signed Said Mane in a £35m deal from Liverpool this summer, are one of the few clubs in Europe who could afford a move for Ronaldo. The 37-year-old has indicated to Manchester United that he wants to leave this summer in order to join a club who could potentially win the Champions League this season. But Bayern’s sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, told Sport1 on Saturday that a move for Ronaldo is not being considered. ‘I have a lot of respect for Cristiano Ronaldo, his successes and his career,’ Salihamidzic said. ‘But once again, that was and is not a topic for us.’ Earlier this week, Chelsea also ruled themselves out of the running to sign Ronaldo.
