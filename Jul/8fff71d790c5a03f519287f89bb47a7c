A Tinder profile of a half-naked man in police equipment has leaked on social media. A screenshot of his dating profile on the app shows him covering his private parts with a police hat, wearing a stab-proof vest and holding a baton. Racy pictures on Tinder are not uncommon but this one has caused particular controversy online as it has been claimed he is a serving officer with Devon and Cornwall Police. Dr Rebecca Tidy, who shared the picture on Twitter, covered the man’s face with an apple emoji. According to the screenshot, the man’s name is Liam and he is 34 years old, although it does not state he works for the local constabulary. Bringing the photo to their attention, she wrote: ‘Hey @DC_Police. One of your lot? I decided against swiping right.’ Her tweet has received more than 100 responses and dozens of shares in the last 24 hours. Later responding to other users, Dr Tidy added: ‘Makes you miss the good old days where folk placed dating ads in the local paper.’ Devon and Cornwall Police are now investigating the screenshot to establish if it shows one of their serving officers. The force said in a statement: ‘We are aware of an image currently circulating on social media that appears to show a partially clothed male in police equipment that is being used as a profile on a dating app. ‘We are working with the Force Professional Standards Department and inquiries continue to establish if this individual is a serving police officer.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
