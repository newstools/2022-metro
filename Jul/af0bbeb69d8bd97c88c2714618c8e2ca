A British aid worker who was captured in eastern Ukraine has died in detention, according to state-owned news in Moscow. Paul Urey was accused of being a mercenary and charged by Russian-backed separatists in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). DPR official Darya Morozova released a statement on Telegram announcing Mr Urey died on July 10. Morozova claimed Mr Urey had been suffering from diabetes and respiratory, kidney and cardiovascular issues. ‘On our part, despite the severity of the alleged crime, Paul Urey was provided with appropriate medical assistance,’ she said. ‘However, given the diagnoses and stress, he passed away on July 10.’ Mr Urey was described as a humanitarian who worked as an aid volunteer in Ukraine, but the DPR insist he was a ‘professional’ soldier.   He was detained along with another Briton, Dylan Healy, by the Russian military in late April. Dominik Byrne, the head of Presidium Network, a non-profit relief group previously in contact with Urey, confirmed he had diabetes. ‘This is worrying news, however this has not been verified by any authority yet and investigations are ongoing to determine the truth,’ Mr Byrne said. Two other Britons and a Moroccan man have been sentenced to death by the DPR, who accused them of ‘mercenary activities’ while fighting for Ukraine. The DPR is a breakaway entity which is only recognised by Russia, Syria and North Korea. Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
