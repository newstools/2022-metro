Cristiano Ronaldo has laughed off a protest from Atletico Madrid supporters who told him he is ‘not welcome’ at the club. The Manchester United forward has told Erik ten Hag that he wants to leave the club and his agent, Jorge Mendes, reiterated as much at the club’s training ground on Tuesday. The 37-year-old has seen hopes of a move to Chelsea dashed by Thomas Tuchel, while Bayern Munich have decided against making a move for the veteran. Despite his options dwindling, Ronaldo remains intent on leaving the Theatre of Dreams and Diego Simeone is said to be keen on signing him. That is despite Ronaldo’s history with rivals Real Madrid, with Simeone feeling Ronaldo can still contribute in the Spanish capital. But that is not a view shared by many Atletico supporters, who unveiled a banner in protest at the club’s friendly with Numancia on Thursday. The banner read: ‘CR7 not welcome’. Ronaldo has reportedly informed United that he has received an offer from a club and would like the Red Devils to consider it. It’s unclear where that bid has come from, with former club Sporting Lisbon believed to be interested. Atletico’s financial situation means it’s unlikely to have come from the Spaniards but in any case, it’s unclear if Ronaldo would be up for the move judging from his social media activity. Replying to an Instagram account that depicted the banner from the Atletico supporters, Ronaldo responded with a series of ‘cry face’ emojis. Ronaldo has been left out of United’s squad for the side’s friendly against Atletico in Oslo on Saturday. Both Ten Hag and Simeone are likely to field questions about the striker’s future.
