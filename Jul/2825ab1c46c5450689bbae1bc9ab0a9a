Two police officers had an unforgettable shift when they helped a woman deliver her baby on the M25 after getting stuck in traffic. The mum-to-be went into labour on a slip road off the Darenth Interchange near Dartford, Kent, on Monday afternoon. It wasn’t an ordinary job for PC Aimee Smith and PC Nathan Southern, who called for assistance from Sergeant Brett Barham who is a trained police medic. But by the time back-up arrived, the baby girl had already been born into the hands of the two capable officers. Sgt Barham said: ‘Due to the extreme traffic congestion in the area we felt that an ambulance would not be able to get to the scene quick enough to assist mum and baby. ‘As a result we turned on the lights and assisted her and her partner with a convoy to the local hospital and left the family in the care of the professionals where I understand they are doing well. ‘I am delighted that we were nearby and able to offer assistance in this case. I wish the family and their new addition, the very best.’ PC Nathan Southern, one of the officers who found the woman, added: ‘I am glad that baby and family are doing well. ‘It will definitely be one of those shifts I remember for the rest of my career.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
