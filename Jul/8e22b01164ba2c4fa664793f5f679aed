A new role as a special envoy to Ukraine awaits Boris Johnson once he leaves Downing Street, it has been reported. He is expected to build on his close relationship with President Volodymyr Zelensky and maintain a place on the world stage with the diplomatic role. The idea was proposed by former senior government advisers, and is being considered at the highest levels, according to the Sun. Mr Johnson’s team, the Cabinet and senior Ukraine officials are reportedly keen he remains in the limelight, and relevant to politics. ‘There is an international need for Boris Johnson’s services. These are exceptional circumstances and an exceptional person is required to deal with them,’ a source said. Another source said the role would allow the Prime Minister an early and dignified exit from Number 10. A group of ex senior strategy advisers and military officials are allegedly supportive of the proposal. As special envoy, he would act as the middleman for the movement of arms and military assistance from the West to Ukraine, and would play a role in future peace talks. They believe Mr Johnson would be ideal for the job given his experience and knowledge of the involved parties, it is understood. It would also ensure he will remain an irritant to the Kremlin, which relished his supposed resignation. A Downing Street source said: ‘The PM has been laser focussed on ending this abhorrent war. ‘He will continue to support Ukraine’s security, protect its sovereignty, deter any further aggression and return to its peaceful existence.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
