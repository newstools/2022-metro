Prince William received a winning kiss from his wife Kate Middleton after a charity polo match. The Duchess of Cambridge arrived at the Royal Charity Polo Cup in Berkshire in an elegant white dress with black detailing by Emilia Wickstead and pearly flats. Meanwhile, her husband wore a light blue shirt, while trousers and sneakers. Before the start of the game, he changed to a polo uniform, featuring a dark blue top and a helmet, for the fundraising tournament. Kate and William were seen laughing and chatting with friends, while also playing with their family dog – an adorable black cocker spaniel called Orla. After the match, he was seen strutting his horse over to the waiting duchess and their puppy. The pair sweetly kissed on both cheeks as the duchess presented the prizes after the end of the game at the Castle Ground at Guards Polo Club, near Windsor Castle. She handed out the helmet trophies and other awards before posing with all the players for a group photograph. Playing with the duke was James Harper, who has been named as captain of the England team for the match against Uruguay for the Coronation Cup at Guards later in July. During the presentations, William was described as playing a defensive role with his team who beat the BP Polo and Monterosso Vikings teams. Organisers said the event had raised £1 million for good causes like London’s Air Ambulance Charity, the homeless organisation the Passage and the East Anglia’s Children’s Hospices. The same polo event in 2021 raised £500,000 but the extra support of donors this year doubled the funds for good causes, such as the Anna Freud Centre, a mental health charity for children.
