Sue Holderness has revealed she was almost gobbled up by an alligator while filming an episode of Only Fools and Horses. The actress, 73, shot to fame playing Marlene Boyce in the classic sitcom alongside Sir David Jason, 82, and Nicholas Lyndhurst, 61, between 1985 and 2002, but Holderness has recalled almost losing her life for the role. In the two-part 1991 Christmas special, titled Miami Twice, the cast filmed in Florida and the episode involved a scene with a real alligator. ‘The idea was this alligator would walk up behind Del and Rodney, they’d run off and the alligator would run towards them where there was a bowl of food,’ Holderness explained in the Channel 5 documentary Only Fools And Horses: Secrets And Scandals. ‘So the alligator was let off its leash and then headed towards the camera to this bowl of food but didn’t stop. The boys were at the other end of the forest by then!’ That’s when the beast turned its attention to Holderness. ‘I, meanwhile, was filming on my video camera,’ she continued. ‘I didn’t notice the boys had gone and I lost the alligator in my camera and it was about two feet from me. ‘Sean, the chap who was supposed to be in charge, jumped on its tail, grabbed its jaws shut and wrapped this thing around it. I nearly died of fear, in fact – I nearly died. ‘I could have been eaten by an alligator.’ Jason actually called second part of the episode his favourite of all time in 2015, so at least the near-death experience paid off. Also in the candid Channel 5 programme, it was revealed which Only Fools and Horses episode creator Jon Sullivan banned from ever airing again. Only Fools and Horses: Secrets and Scandals is available to stream on My5. Got a story?
