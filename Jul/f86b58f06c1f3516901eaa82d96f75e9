Nate Diaz slapped an MMA reporter backstage at UFC 276 after warning over his recent social media comments. Diaz, 37, was in attendance during Saturday’s show in Las Vegas with Israel Adesanya headlining the card in his decision victory over Jared Cannonier. Before the main card action got underway, the reporter approached Diaz backstage, asking him if he was rooting for Sean O’Malley, the bantamweight sensation who was in action against Pedro Munhoz. An unimpressed Diaz replied: ‘Nah. And you better watch your tweets about my dude who was fighting recently.” The reporter replied: ‘Oh I know’ before Diaz slapped the microphone out of his hand, taking aim for a second time to knock the reporter’s hat off his head. The reporter in question appeared to be from Full Send MMA, which is owned by YouTube stars the Nelk Boys. Diaz has not fought since June last year when he suffered defeat to Leon Edwards and is thought to have one fight left on his current UFC contract. The Stockton fighter recently pleaded with UFC to release him from his contract, eager to take on offers as a free agent having also been linked with a move into boxing to take on Jake Paul. Diaz shared an iconic rivalry with Conor McGregor in 2016 but has fought just three times since then. In 2019 he secured a win over Anthony Pettis but is without a win since then having lost to Jorge Masvidal and Edwards since.
