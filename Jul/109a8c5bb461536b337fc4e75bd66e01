A large cannabis factory has been discovered in a former police station just five months after it was sold. The Metropolitan Police were called to one of their own former bases in the Isle of Dogs, east London, on Sunday. No arrests have been made but an investigation has been launched. The station, on Manchester Road, was sold in February this year. Isle of Dogs councillor Peter Golds told the Evening Standard: ‘Two years ago we found a cannabis factory in a school in the borough and now this. ‘We have said for years there are problems with antisocial behaviour in Tower Hamlets, but we have continued to see police stations close down.’ Documents from the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan’s office previously said the station had ‘no public access function’. Sixteen similar stations were also lined up for possible closure from 2021 to 2022. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: ‘On Sunday July 24 officers from Central East Basic Command Unit were alerted to a potential cannabis factory at the former Isle of Dogs police station on Manchester Road, E14. ‘On arrival a large cannabis factory was found which is currently a crime scene with officers at the location. There has been no arrest and the investigation is ongoing. ‘The Isle of Dogs police station was sold on February 25 2022 and is no longer Metropolitan Police Service property.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
