Boris Johnson has said he was ‘sorry’ to receive Rishi Sunak’s letter resigning from his cabinet. In a written reply, the prime minister praised his ‘outstanding service’, saying: ‘Dear Rishi, I was sorry to receive your letter resigning from the Government. ‘You have provided outstanding service to the country through the most challenging period for our economy in peacetime history’. He noted the furlough scheme, Mr Sunak’s work on post-pandemic economic recovery and to repair public finances, as well as tax cuts. ‘I have enormously valued your advice and deep commitment to public service and will miss working with you in government,’ he concluded. Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid announced they had quit the government within minutes of each other this evening. They were followed by a host of others, including four Tory MPs who quit their ministerial aide roles as parliamentary private secretaries – among them Jonathan Gullis, seen as strongly loyal to the PM. Mr Johnson also told Sajid Javid he was ‘sorry’ to receive his resignation letter as health secretary. In a brief letter roughly half as long as the one he sent to Mr Sunak, the Prime Minister wrote: ‘Dear Saj, Thank you for your letter this evening tendering your resignation. I was very sorry to receive it. ‘You have served this Government, and the people of the United Kingdom, with distinction.’ Mr Johnson noted Mr Javid’s work to tackle Covid backlogs and other plans for the health service, and vowed that ‘the Government will continue to deliver on them’. ‘You will be greatly missed, and I look forward to your contribution from the backbenches,’ he concluded.
