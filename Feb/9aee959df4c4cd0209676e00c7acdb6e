Trevoh Chalobah has criticised referee Stuart Attwell for allowing Naby Keita’s tackle to go unpunished during Chelsea’s defeat to Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final. Liverpool beat Chelsea on penalties after a thrilling match ended goalless at Wembley. But Chelsea were furious after Keita was not even given a yellow card for his challenge on Chalobah in the 58th minute. The Liverpool midfielder missed the ball completely and his studs raked down the inner thigh of the Chelsea defender, who needed stitches to heal the wound. Attwell did not consult VAR over Keita’s challenge, while the Liverpool midfielder was not even given a yellow card for his challenge. After the game, Chalobah shared a clip of the tackle on Twitter along with the caption: ‘Had to get stitches because of this. Referee is right there I don’t get it??’ Meanwhile, former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink accused Keita of ‘endangering’ Chalobah and believes the Liverpool midfielder should have been sent off. ‘I’m surprised nothing has been said about it. We are now looking at it but for me Keita’s movement, he slows down,’ Hasselbaink told Sky Sports. ‘Then he goes for the tackle. They both go for the but Keita totally misses the ball. If you look here he totally misses the ball and hits the player really hard. ‘For me, that is endangering the opposition. Endangering the player and that should be a red card. I don’t understand that the referee didn’t see it. ‘I don’t understand at all that VAR has not seen it because this is really bad. I’m very surprised, very, very surprised.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
