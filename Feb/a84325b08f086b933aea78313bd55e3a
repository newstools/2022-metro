A 21-year-old man who learned to fly a plane before getting behind the wheel of a car has passed his driving test first time. James Dunk, from Kent, first sat in the cockpit of light aircraft aged 14 and passed his plane exams in July 2020 – at the age of 19. James achieved the £10,000 licence after nine tests, which included a 150-mile solo flight from Kent to Essex, then West Sussex and all the way back. In November, the pilot even took his mum, Louise, on a flight. And after passing his test with only three faults on Thursday, James joked: ‘It was rather amusing letting the examiner know that I have a pilot’s licence whilst on the driving test. ‘I suppose most people would learn to drive and then think about learning to fly, but it’s always been my ambition to join the RAF and fly Typhoons, so it was planes first for me. ‘At least I won’t have to scrounge a lift from my dad or my girlfriend now.’ James’ dad Paul accompanied him on a train journey to Wiltshire on Saturday, where he collected his new car and drove it on a three-hour, 175-mile journey home. Meanwhile in 2020, a new driver highlighted the benefit of consuming bananas before a driving exam, as she passed her test after eating the ‘driving test superfood’. Katie Timms, from Plymouth, had struggled to get a licence after seven years, four failed tests, four instructors and more than 250 hours of lessons. She said at the time: ‘However ridiculous it might sound, I am pretty sure that I passed my driving test because I ate a banana – or three. ‘[My instructor] told me it was a frequent suggestion, but that if you didn’t know how to drive, a banana could not help you – obviously.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
