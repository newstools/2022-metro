A serial flasher on roller skates is exposing himself to women across London. The Metropolitan Police has launched an appeal to find the sex pest who is targeting women walking by themselves. Once he has their attention, the predator flashes his genitals or touches himself inappropriately. In every case under investigation by the Met, the man was on roller skates. Seven women have come forward about being flashed as recently as January 26 at 10pm on Regent’s Canal in Camden. The suspect exposed himself 12 days earlier at 9.45am in Goods Way, King’s Cross. That happened the day after he did the same thing at 9.30pm in Wapping Woods, Tower Hamlets. He is also linked to the following indecent exposures: Detectives have released an e-fit image illustrating what they believe he looks like. He is a white man, around six feet tall, with a bald head, and is usually wearing roller skates. Indecent exposure is treated as a sexual offence in the UK. This means anyone convicted of the crime is put on the sex offenders’ register. The maximum sentence for indecent exposure is two years in jail.
