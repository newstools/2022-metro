Olly Murs has been forced to cancel his tour this summer after being taken to hospital for a knee operation. The Troublemaker singer suffered a painful injury onstage in August last year that saw a bone fragment get lodged in his knee and has had to undergo multiple operations. Sharing a photo of himself on crutches and with his leg bandaged up on Instagram, Olly wrote: ‘I am gutted to have to write this message but unfortunately I’ve had to undergo major new knee surgery again this week 🤦🏻‍♂️😩 been trying my best to avoid having it done but the op was needed and it went well. ‘I’m recovering in hospital but it means I’m having to cancel all my summer shows this year whilst I focus on my rehab. Refunds will all be available from your point of purchase and please keep an eye out for any emails from your ticketing agent over the next few days. ‘I’m so bloody sorry but my focus now is on recovering and I’ll keep you all updated on how I’m getting on! Stay cheeky catch you soon👍🏻❤️😘.’ Fans and friends have shared their support, with James Bay commenting: ‘Get rested lad, all the best! ♥️’. ‘Speedy recovery bro ❤️,’ Marvin Humes added. Last year, Olly suffered a fall on stage and had to have an operation on his left leg to dislodge a bone fragment that had got stuck in his knee. The 37-year-old suffered the mishap when he jumped mid-performance and was left limping throughout the rest of his set. He vowed to rest up and recover properly in order to return to the stage. ‘It’s been a mad 72 hours since the gig, getting to this point,’ he said at the time, ‘Basically after my second song a fragment of bone that was in my knee, after I jumped, managed to lodge itself on the back of my knee which basically shut my leg down, and during the gig I was just limping the whole time. Couldn’t believe it.’ However, it later gave him trouble when he took part in Soccer Aid in September last year, having to be subbed off just minute into the match. Olly previously took time out to recover from ‘serious knee surgery’ in 2019 which he revealed he ‘needed for some time’. Got a story?
