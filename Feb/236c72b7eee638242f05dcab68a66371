Meghan Markle’s former Suits co-star Patrick J. Adams has claimed the Duchess of Sussex once rinsed him after het got completely naked on stage. Meghan and Patrick starred as on-screen couple Michael Ross and Rachel Zane for seven seasons until she quit the drama and married Prince Harry, as you do. While the pair shared many intimate scenes on-screen, Meghan mocked Patrick after seeing him strip down to his birthday suit on stage during his performance in the play 9 Circles, which features full-frontal male nudity. ‘She certainly was at the play where I was naked and she had a good time making fun of me after,’ he told Entertainment Tonight, joking: ‘So, maybe she’d like a repeat performance.’ However, Meghan’s reaction hasn’t deterred Patrick from inviting the former Royal to his next Broadway play where he’ll be getting his kit off again. ‘I would love for Meghan to come and enjoy the show,’ he said. ‘I’ll send her an invite for sure.’ Patrick and Meghan remained close after she left Suits, with the actor attending the Royal wedding in 2018. When Harry and Meghan moved to the States in 2020, Patrick said they’ve kept in touch. ‘We’ve texted a few times,’ he told Entertainment Tonight. ‘We both started families at roughly the same time, obviously her family has been a relatively high-profile one, but I’m super happy to have her back on this side of the water.’ He’s also recently teased that he would ‘kill’ to work with his former co-star again. ‘She’s a huge talent and more than anything she’s the most motivated, driven human being I’ve ever met in my life. I’m very excited to see what she does,’ he told Extra. Suits is available to stream on Netflix UK. Got a story?
