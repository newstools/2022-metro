The trial into the shooting of a black anti-racism campaigner has collapsed. Mum-of-two Sasha Johnson was gunned down at a south London house party in May 2021 and is still in hospital – some nine months later. Four men had been facing charges at the Old Bailey, but on Tuesday the prosecution announced that the Crown would not be pursuing the case. Prince Dixon, 25, of Gravesend, Kent; Troy Reid, 20 of Southwark; Cameron Deriggs, 19, of Lewisham; and Devonte Brown, 19, of Southwark; had denied conspiracy to murder. The quartet also pleaded not guilty to possession of a firearm and ammunition with intent to endanger life. Their trial had previously been set to go ahead on March 7. Ms Johnson, who was shot in the head, is now said to be serious but stable condition, having initially been described as ‘critical’. The 28-year-old was injured during a silent disco in the garden of a house on Consort Road in Peckham, just before 3am on Sunday, May 23. Ms Johnson is a founding member of the Taking The Initiative Party and had been a prominent figure in the Black Lives Matter movement last summer. Police have previously said that they do not believe she was the intended victim of the shooting. The four defendants appeared by video link from Belmarsh top security prison for the hearing, overseen by Mr Justice Hilliard QC. Wearing black tracksuits, the men smiled as prosecutor Mark Heywood QC announced their case was being dropped following a review. Mr Justice Hilliard recorded formal not guilty verdicts after the prosecution offered no evidence. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
