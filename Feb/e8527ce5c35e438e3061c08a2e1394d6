A road ‘looks like it’s been hit by an earthquake’ after it was torn up by unexplained underground movements. Dramatic pictures show the B4069, near Lyneham in Wiltshire, totally buckled. Some parts of the road are completely split, with mounds rising up into 45-degree angles. An emergency closure was put in place on February 17 – but some drivers have still tried to use the route. It’s believed it may cost millions to fix, with locals also warning that it has been terrible for businesses in the area. Pub-manager Brendan Watkins said he has lost 50% of his customers as they can no longer get to him. He agrees fixing the road is a ‘big job’, but says it ‘needs to be done quickly’ due to the financial impact. Wiltshire council’s cabinet member for transport, Dr Mark McClelland, told BBC Radio Wiltshire it is accurate to compare the damage to an earthquake. ‘This road has been subject to remedial works in the past and it has been a difficult road to deal with, but we’ve never seen anything like this before’, Dr McClelland said. ‘It could cost hundreds of thousands or up into the millions to fix. There is significant damage to the road. It could be up to 12 months in total. ‘It’s not something that can be resolved in a matter of days or weeks.’ He went on to warn drivers it is incredibly dangerous to insist on using the route. The council is waiting for geotechnical specialists to determine why the underlying ground has slipped. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
