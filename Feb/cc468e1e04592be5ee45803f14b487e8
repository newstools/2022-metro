Dancing on Ice’s Connor Ball has revealed he needed stitches after slicing his leg open during last night’s episode. The Vamps singer, 25, was performing with partner Alexandra Schauman when he lost his balance lifting the skater with a mop during his routine to George Ezra’s Paradise. Hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield were visibly concerned as Connor confirmed he was definitely ‘bleeding’. ‘The blade went into my leg, so I don’t know if something is cut up,’ Connor sighed. Ouch! Following last night’s episode, which saw Corrie’s Sally Dynevor eliminated from the contest, Connor assured fans he was doing ‘okay’ but needed stitches. He tweeted: ‘guys im okay, currently getting my leg stitched up but thank you so so so much for voting me through once again, you guys are actually incredible i’m too lucky honestly.’ Fans immediately sent their well-wishes, with one follower posting; ‘Hope your alright. Totally routing for you on dancing on ice.’ He also shared a video of medics attending to his leg, laughing with a pal who told the star: ‘You owe me.’ So at least he’s in good spirits. Connor’s latest accident comes after he was left with a bleeding chin last week, while current favourite to win, Regan Gascoigne, popped his shoulder out of its socket during training too. Dancing on Ice continues Sunday at 6pm on ITV. Got a story?
