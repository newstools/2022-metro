We all know the story. You buy a new pair of fresh white trainers with your hard-earned cash. They look really good. You wear them with jeans, a T-shirt and a blazer and think you look like a model off-duty. You won’t shut up about them to your friends. They were a great buy, you say, until you see the beginnings of a crease. While many don’t get irritated by creases in trainers, some do. A sign of wear, they can send some over the edge. However, one woman has saved the day by sharing a five minute hack to get those pesky creases out of your sneakers. TikTok user @tanyahomeinspo shared the tip in a clip which has been viewed over 586,000 times. In it, she tells users to take some cloths and stuff them into the trainers. Next take a bowl of boiling hot water and saturate another cloth in the liquid. Place the hot cloth over the trainers (specifically where the creases are) and leave for five minutes. At the end, your trainers should look as good as new. The hack works especially well on Nike Air Force Ones which are made from leather. Those in the comments collectively agreed it was a hack they would use in future. ‘Omg I’m trying this today! My son is a toe walker and his white sneakers are creased so badly,’ wrote one viewer. ‘Defo trying this. Every time my daughter’s Nike Air Force crease she refuses to wear them,’ added another. Meanwhile, some users shared their personal tips for a crease free shoe life. ‘It’s better with a damp cloth and iron,’ advised one commenter. While a second added: ‘Just use wooden shoe trees. My Gucci shoes don’t have one crease.’ Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
