Thomas Tuchel has dropped Romelu Lukaku for Chelsea’s Champions League clash against Lille on Tuesday evening. The Belgium international has struggled to make an impact in recent weeks, while during Chelsea’s 1-0 win over Crystal Palace at the weekend, he registered just seven touches. For the first leg of Chelsea’s last-16 Champions League tie at Stamford Bridge, Tuchel has opted to bench Lukaku and begin with an attacking trio of Hakim Ziyech, Kai Havertz and Christian Pulisic. ‘I felt him a little bit tired,’ Tuchel said when asked about Lukaku’s absence. ‘He looked a bit exhausted and you have to consider that he’s played a lot. ‘We’ve had extra time [in the Club World Cup final], a lot of travelling recently and it wasn’t easy for him against Palace, this wasn’t his best performance. ‘So maybe it will be a bit easier for him to come on from the bench tonight and turn things around if we need him.’ Former Chelsea and England manager Glenn Hoddle believes Tuchel is right to axe Lukaku given his recent performance. ‘It’s obviously a big call but I think it’s the right one,’ Hoddle told BT Sport. ‘He’s not been playing well enough and any manager has got the right to drop a player if he’s not playing up to his very best. ‘Since that interview, let’s face it, he’s been no where near his best. He’s had an injury, he had that stupid interview which upset everything, it’s upset him more than anything. ‘At the end of the day, it’s time to take him out, they weren’t doing too bad without him with no recognised centre forward.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
