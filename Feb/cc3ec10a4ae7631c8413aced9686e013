Former Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka claims Paul Pogba told him that he is open to leaving Manchester United for Paris Saint-Germain. The 28-year-old is expected to leave Old Trafford this summer when his contract expires, while several clubs across Europe have been linked with a move, including PSG, Barcelona and Real Madrid. Anelka, who briefly played alongside Pogba at Juventus, believes United’s current situation is making it difficult for the World Cup winner to shine. And Anelka believes Pogba would be better off joining PSG in the summer transfer window. ‘I know Paul, I played with him at Juventus, and it’s amazing what he can do with the ball,’ Anelka told RMC Sport. ‘Unfortunately, when he arrives in Manchester, they are not a big team. They are a team that has to rebuild themselves, they are looking for its game plan, they are looking for a coach. ‘It’s been very difficult for him since he came back. He’s been criticised a lot. It’s not the best club where he can have fun and show his talent. ‘I think PSG would be great for him. Some say it wouldn’t be good for Paris, because he’s supposedly often injured. But I think his injuries are due to his life in Manchester, because he’s not psychologically well.’ Asked if Pogba would want to join PSG, Anelka said: ‘I discussed this six months ago with him and he would not be against coming to PSG. ‘If he comes, we will forget all the injuries and we will see that he is a top player.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
