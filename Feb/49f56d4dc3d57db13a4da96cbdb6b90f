Need a little good news today? Well, Billy’s got you covered. The 10-year-old cat spent almost a year in a Blue Cross shelter after his previous owner had a change of living circumstances. The poor guy had not one but two potential new adoptions fall through for a number of reasons, and the charity was desperate to find him a new forever home. Indeed, we included sweet Billy in our list of adorable pets who needed homes for Valentine’s. Sadly, black cats like Billy can be tough to rehome due to the enduring superstition that they bring bad luck. In the end, the only one who was unlucky was Billy himself – that is, until Valentine’s Day. After first coming to the charity on 23 March 2021, on 14 February 2022, his new owner Melanie, from Odiham, Hampshire, applied to adopt him after seeing his profile online. ‘Billy had been one of our longest stay pets, but we’re so pleased that he has now found his perfect forever home,’ said Kirsty Smith rehoming supervisor at Blue Cross Southampton. ‘He was a little nervous when he came to us but once he settled you could really see his personality shine, he’s such a playful and affectionate boy. ‘He enjoys lots of head tickles and belly rubs, playing with toys and curling up next to you and falling asleep. ‘We had spoken to a lot of people about him but nothing that came to anything. ‘It was well worth the wait as this home seems perfect for him, and he’ll make a great companion for his new owner.’ Do you have a story to share?
