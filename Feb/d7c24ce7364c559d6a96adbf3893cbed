On your ‘things to happen in 2022’ bingo card, we can’t imagine you had a previously-unknown word game becoming a cultural phenomenon. Wordle was released in October last year, going from 90 daily players to millions in a matter of weeks. The game was such a success that its creator, Josh Wardle, sold it to The New York Times, and it continues to trend on Twitter as people share their scores. Amid horrifying worldwide news coming at us 24/7, Wordle was a refuge of normality for many. With only one game per day, there’s no pressure to be always ‘on’, and the fact everyone gets the same answer means it’s ripe for lighthearted water cooler chat (both online and in real life). The wholesome pastime hasn’t just filled our Twitter feeds with square emoji  either – it’s also seeping into our wardrobes. ‘Wordle green’ is the newest shade to storm the fashion world, putting a sartorial spin on the green squares in the game. It’s the latest in a string of green-filled catwalk shows and collections, with ‘Kermit green’ and rich khaki hues dominating high-end boutiques and high streets alike. If you’re not familiar with Wordle green through diligently building your win streak, it sits somewhere between acid lime and olive, with slight warm undertones but a brighter quality than more brownish shades. Although it’s close to the middle on the scale of light to dark green, there’s room for change in how you interpret Wordle green based on what suits your style and colouring best. Even with a monochrome outfit, you ideally want to embrace different tonal elements – which gives you a decent amount of leeway until Wordle release an exact-match clothing line. Like the smash-hit game, the beauty of the colour is its simplicity. It may be a craze right now, but you’ll be able to wear grassy-green pieces with anything in your wardrobe long after the trend has passed. We’ve rounded up our favourite high street fashion in the versatile springtime shade, so you can show off your spelling prowess with a subtle nod – at least hopefully more subtle than everyone’s social media Wordle score brags.
