Mikel Arteta has revealed his half-time pep talk to his Arsenal players to inspire their 2-1 victory over Wolves. Arsenal went behind early on as Hwang Hee-Chan capitalised on Gabriel’s mistake to put Wolves in front. The Gunners were on the front foot for the majority of the game but were struggling to find a way through until Nicolas Pepe scored an equaliser with eight minutes remaining. Arsenal then snatched a late winner in injury time as Alexandre Lacazette’s effort caught the hand of Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa, who steered the ball into the net. The win now puts Arsenal one point behind fourth-placed Manchester United but the Gunners have two games in hand over Ralf Rangnick’s side. When asked after the game if he would’ve preferred an easier route to victory, Arteta told Amazon Prime: ‘Probably I will say the way we won it because it creates such a belief, a togetherness, an atmosphere and cohesion with our fans as well and that’s extremely necessary. ‘We really want to create something special here and without our fans we’re not going to be able to do it. ‘This team needs that belief. We are a really young squad. ‘I just said at half time, ‘we want to be there, third, fourth at the top with the big teams we have to be able to go out in the second half and beat them’. ‘That was the spirit right from the beginning of half time and they managed to do it.’ When it was pointed out that if Arsenal win their two games in hand they will move into fourth place, Arteta replied: ‘Yes but ‘if’ in football doesn’t work, we have to do it, so we are still not there.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
