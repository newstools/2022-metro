Gogglebox viewers were over the moon as they tuned into tonight’s show, as a new family made their debut. For the first time since 2016, a Scottish couple have been cast on the Channel 4 show after a hunt to find cast members north of the border. The new stars are Roisin and Joe from Glasgow, who are the first Scottish household appearing on the programme since the Manuels, also from Glasgow. After 18 series and numerous families, fans were delighted to finally have some Scottish representation again. Viewers took to Twitter to share their excitement. ‘So glad to finally have a Scottish family on #Gogglebox – and Glasgow representing! #roisinandjoe – love it,’ one wrote. Another tweeted: ‘Love to see a Scottish couple on #gogglebox 🙌🏻 There are both fans and haters of every family, I’m sure they will be no different. I wish them well in dealing with it all 💕’ One Twitter user said they were ‘enjoying the authentic Scottish folk on Gogglebox’ as the pair cracked jokes and had viewers chuckling after just one appearance. The sweet couple are aged 23 and 25, and have been together for four years. They live at Joe’s family home, having moved in together at the start of lockdown. The newbies join Gogglebox royalty such as Jenny and Lee, the Siddiqui family, and Pete and Sophie. Tonight’s episode had viewers in stitches at the cast’s reactions to shows including Celebrity Help! My House is Haunted, Teen First Dates and ITV’s Starstruck. Roisin and Joe join after Channel 4 launched a dedicated casting team to find Scots to star in the popular TV show following scrutiny. According to the network, Gogglebox newcomer Roisin loves shopping, getting dressed up and socialising with her friends. Joe, meanwhile, enjoys playing video games, making pizza and spending time with Roisin. They’ve become armchair critics following the Scottish Affairs Committee’s session in the Commons last September, where Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told Channel 4 bosses there had not been a Scottish family on the programme since 2016. Channel 4’s chief executive Alex Mahon later wrote to MPs confirming the broadcaster had agreed a separate budget for a dedicated team to find Scots to appear on the show. Gogglebox continues on Fridays at 9pm on Channel 4. Got a story?
