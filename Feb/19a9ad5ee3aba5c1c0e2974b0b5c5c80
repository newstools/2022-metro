A Turkish ship has reportedly been struck by a bomb off the coast of Odessa in Ukraine after Vladimir Putin launched an ‘onslaught on the free and sovereign nation’. There were no casualties and it is safely en route into Romanian waters, Turkey’s Maritime General Directorate said. But the incident is likely to add to mounting fears that Nato could be eventually forced to wage a defensive war against Russia. The alliance has ruled out military action as Ukraine is not a member – but Turkey is one of the 30 countries in Nato. ‘Graduated response plans’ were activated by the organisation today amid fears the Kremlin may not stop at Ukraine and could even want to recreate the Soviet Union. Gen Sir Richard Shirreff, a former senior British army officer, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Absolutely there is a possibility that we as a nation will be at war with Russia. ‘Because if Russia puts one boot-step across Nato territory, we are all at war with Russia – every single member of the Nato alliance. ‘We in this country must recognise that our security starts not on the white cliffs of Dover – it starts in the forests of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.’ It comes as Chernobyl is captured by Russian forces hours after the invasion was launched this morning. Boris Johnson warned today Putin would ‘never be able to cleanse blood of Ukraine from his hands’. He described the Russian leader as a ‘bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest’ as he unveiled a raft of fresh sanctions. The Prime Minister said he would ‘exclude Russian banks from the British financial system’ by stopping them from accessing sterling and clearing payments through the UK. Measures unveiled this evening will hit five further oligarchs, including the Russian President’s former son-in-law, and target more than 100 businesses and individuals.
