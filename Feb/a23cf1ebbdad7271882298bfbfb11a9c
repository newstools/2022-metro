An elderly woman was dragged out of the way of an oncoming tram with seconds to spare by a quick-thinking biker. The man was waiting in traffic when he spotted the woman in jeopardy coming down the street. He jumped from his bike and pulled her to safety, narrowly avoiding being hit by the tram himself. The near-miss was filmed in the city of Maceio in the north-eastern Brazilian state of Alagoas on February 22. According to local reports, the 77-year-old woman was unable to hear the oncoming tram while she slowly shuffled across the tracks in the neighbourhood of Poco. As the motorcyclist dragged the woman away, she apparently challenged him over what he was doing. The pensioner, named as Rute Acioli, said after the incident: ‘I didn’t see the train, I just realised I was falling. The boy grabbed me and threw me to the ground.’ The woman, who lives alone, added: “I fell over and said to him “what do you think you are doing?” Then he said “look at the tram”. ‘That is when I looked and saw the tram passing. I did not look to the side to see the tram, I was paying attention to the cars.’ The transport firm Companhia Brasileira de Trens Urbanos (CBTU) said the maximum speed of the tram on that stretch is 20kph (around 12mph) and that the driver reduced his speed when he saw the elderly woman. The transport company added that pedestrians should be careful when crossing tram lines as the vehicles are unable to stop abruptly.
