Two men have been arrested after a schoolboy was stabbed on an east London high street. The emergency services found the 14-year-old with knife wounds after racing to the scene in Barkingside shortly after 4pm yesterday. He was airlifted to hospital by the London Ambulance Service who responded with several teams of paramedics. Footage from the scene shows the air ambulance landing on the busy high street as police officers put up a cordon around several shops. The Met confirmed two men were arrested and are now in custody at a nearby police station. The victim’s condition in hospital and the severity of his injuries have not been revealed by the force. London endured a record number of teenage murders last year. A total of 30 teens lost their lives to the bloodshed, surpassing the previous record of 29 set in 2008. Donovan Allen, 18, was named as this year’s first teenage victim after being stabbed to death in Enfield earlier this month. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
