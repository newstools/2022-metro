Thomas Tuchel has praised N’Golo Kante for his performance in Chelsea’s 2-0 win over Lille in the Champions League but admits the midfielder has ‘struggled’ in recent games. Kante delivered a man-of-the-match display at Stamford Bridge as goals from Kai Havertz and Christian Pulisic sealed the victory for the European champions. The World Cup winner’s impressive run through midfield created Pulisic’s goal and Tuchel has described the 30-year-old as Chelsea’s ‘game-changer’. ‘I was very pleased today,’ Tuchel said of Kante’s performance. ‘It took him a while, I have to say. It was not the real N’Golo in the last matches. ‘He struggled a bit in belief, in his intensity and in his game in general. ‘It was good that he stepped up today, it was good to see and you can instantly see how big the impact is if he is in good shape. ‘He is our game-changer, of course. He had a huge impact, I’m very happy for him and the team.’ Meanwhile, former Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole claims Kante is the Premier League’s most-influential midfielder over the past decade. ‘I don’t think there’s a midfielder as influential as him, certainly in the last 10 years, in our league, an all-round midfielder,’ said Cole. ‘What he did at Leicester and what he’s done at Chelsea… everything he does. ‘When he plays well, you win.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
