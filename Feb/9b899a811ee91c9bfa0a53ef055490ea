The world’s largest venomous spider has turned up in Hull of all places after embarking on a 5,000-mile journey. Native to Australia, the huntsman spider arrived in East Yorkshire after sneaking into a shipping container from China. As soon as staff unpacked the container, they promptly legged it. The huntsman, which boosts 12-inch-long legs, is not deadly to humans but they can cause headaches, vomiting and heart palpitations. Officers from the RSPCA were called in and they eventually captured the creature. An RSPCA spokesman said: ‘He fancied a holiday so he hopped on a shipping container in China and ended up in Hull. He gave staff quite a fright. ‘He’s now having some R&R at a specialist rescue centre.’ It isn’t the first time the UK has encountered some fearsome spiders. Last year saw a surge in the number of false widow spiders both here and in Ireland. False widows are unlikely to bite humans unless provoked or agitated, but they can trigger serious symptoms, ranging from numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to burning sensations and chest pains. A student and football coach almost died after they were bitten by false widow spiders, while another woman was hospitalised three times after she was bitten on the toilet. However, animal experts have downplayed the risk of false widows. Ecologist Graeme Skinner previously told Metro.co.uk: ‘The species of spiders that we have in the UK are generally shy. Even false widows are not aggressive. They’re a small animal in a big world.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
