Christian Eriksen has come off the bench to make his Brentford debut in his first game since suffering a cardiac arrest last year. Eriksen came on after 52 minutes at the Brentford Community Stadium with the 30-year-old given a huge standing ovation from everyone in the stadium during Saturday afternoon’s clash with Newcastle United. The Dane completes an emotional return to football 257 days on from the harrowing scenes at Euro 2020 last June when he collapsed on the pitch during a match against Finland. He was replaced by countryman Mathias Jensen – the same man who replaced him after he was stretchered off during that fateful day last summer. The midfielder received life-saving treatment on the pitch from his quick-thinking teammates and the Danish medical staff before being rushed to hospital. Eriksen was subsequently fitted with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) – a type of pacemaker – but was unable to continue playing in Italy with the device. After being released by Inter Milan in December, he signed a six-month contract with Brentford at the start of the year. The Bees have been wary of rushing the former Tottenham star back, handing him some game time in two friendly games before being named in the matchday squad on Saturday against Newcastle. ‘Christian will be in the squad, he will get on the pitch for his debut tomorrow, it will be amazing,’ Brentford boss Thomas Frank said on Friday. ‘It is a big day for all of us, but especially Christian and his family. Everyone saw what happened [last summer] and it is another reminder that we are privileged to do what we do, so we need to appreciate every moment.’ MORE : Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta says Christian Eriksen’s return is ‘great news for football’ ahead of possible Brentford debut MORE : Christian Eriksen provides assist on his return in Brentford friendly For more stories like this, check our sport page.
