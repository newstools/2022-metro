Russia says it is ‘ready for talks’ with Ukraine and has sent a delegation to Belarus in a move dismissed as ‘pointless’ by Kyiv. The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky told his country in a video message he was prepared to begin talks but not in Belarus, a close ally of Russia which was a staging ground for the invasion. He named Warsaw, Bratislava, Istanbul, Budapest or Baku as possible alternative venues and made it clear other locations were also possible. Despite this clear message from Zelensky, Russia has sent its officials to the Belarusian city of Gomel anyway.

And now they say – “we are waiting,”‘ he said. ‘Zelensky’s position remains unchanged: only real negotiations, no ultimatums.’ Russia launched a fresh wave of attacks on key infrastructure sites in Ukraine overnight on Saturday after being frustrated by a lack of progress in the first few days of the invasion. There has also been street fighting in the second largest city of Kharkiv, which is located just 12 miles south of the Russian border. Zelensky said the night had been brutal, with shelling of civilian infrastructure and attacks on ‘everything, including ambulances.’ But in his video message he remained defiant. ‘We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on,’ he said. The United States and its allies have imposed a range of sanctions on Russia in response to the assault. On Saturday, they moved to block certain Russian banks’ access to the SWIFT international payment system. They also said they would impose restrictions on Russia’s central bank to limit its ability to support the rouble and finance Putin’s war effort.
