The Welsh Open was the scene of arguably the greatest shock in snooker history last season when Jordan Brown won the title by beating Ronnie O’Sullivan at Celtic Manor and the event is back for the 2022 edition on Monday. Brown was a 750/1 outside before the tournament but stunned the sport by downing the likes of Mark Selby and Stephen Maguire before edging the Rocket out in the final. It has now been 30 years of the Welsh Open, with Stephen Hendry winning the first edition of the event back in 1992. John Higgins has been the most successful player in the event’s history, winning it five times, with O’Sullivan claiming the trophy on four occasions.
