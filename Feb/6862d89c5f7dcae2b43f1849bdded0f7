A young girl had a lucky escape when she was hit in the head by a BB gun pellet while jumping on her trampoline. Lilly Parkes, 10, screamed out in pain when she was shot at outside her home in Rowner, near Portsmouth, while playing with her one-year-old sibling. Her dad Ashley, 32, saw four teenagers aged between 14 and 17 running in fields behind his house on Monday morning. He told the Plymouth News: ‘Lilly heard a loud pop and felt an impact to the back of her head. I heard her screaming and ran into the garden where there was a puddle of blood. She had a gaping hole in her head. ‘I saw four teenagers running across the field. They obviously saw her head popping up and down on the trampoline and have taken a lucky shot. ‘Luckily she was not facing out to the field otherwise she could have been hit in the eye. ‘My daughter had a lucky escape. I don’t want to think what could have happened.’ He has contacted police started a social media campaign to find them, but admits it is like ‘finding a needle in a haystack’. He said: ‘My wife and myself are mortified that people would shoot someone, especially when it is a child,’ he said. ‘If they are willing to put a bullet in a child’s head then I can’t imagine what they would do to animals or other people. ‘She is still traumatised and has not stepped near the back door since it happened. ‘She needed a bandage around the head where she had stitches. The hole was the size of a fingernail with blood gushing out and all over her hands.’
