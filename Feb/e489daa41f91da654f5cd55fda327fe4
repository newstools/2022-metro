A life-changing amount of money that ‘must-be-won’ is up for grabs in the National Lottery draw on Saturday. There were no winners in Wednesday night’s draw, which means an estimated £11.7 million rollover could be claimed this weekend. The eye-watering sum of money will either be scooped by one lucky winner who matches all numbers, or it will be shared between runners up. No contestants matched all six main numbers to bag the estimated £9 million jackpot on Wednesday, and no one got the five numbers and bonus ball combination needed to win the second biggest prize of £1 million. A total of 37 ticket-holders won £1,750 after matching five of the six numbers. The winning Lotto numbers were 04, 22, 26, 27, 33 and 37, and the bonus ball was 20. Set of balls nine and draw machine Lancelot were used. No players matched all five numbers to win the Lotto HotPicks, but 11 people got four numbers to claim £13,000 each. The winning Thunderball numbers were 01, 07, 19, 24 and 30, and the Thunderball was 14. Ticket-holders missed out on bagging the top prize of £500,000, but six won the next biggest prize of £5,000 each for matching five numbers. A total of 35 people won £250 for matching four numbers plus the Thunderball. A huge £109,915,000 EuroMillions jackpot was handed over to a lucky UK ticket holder on Valentines Day. The vast sum made them the 10th biggest National Lottery winner of all time. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
