  Tyson Fury has taunted Dillian Whyte once again after the Londoner signed his contract for their WBC heavyweight title showdown. Just hours before the deadline, Whyte signed his half of the deal for their Battle of Britain which is expected to take place back in the UK in April. ‘The Body Snatcher’ has remained silent since the fight was formally announced by the WBC, with Fury’s co-promoter Frank Warren winning the purse bid to host the bout. Whyte is set to receive just 20 per cent of the fight purse with Fury mocking the Londoner following news that the deal is finally done. ‘Oh my God, Dillian Whyte signed his contract for $8million. What a surprise!,’ Fury said with a hefty dose of sarcasm on Tuesday morning. ‘An absolute idiot. Should this even be a talking point? Man signs for the biggest pay day he is ever going to get in his life.’ Resuming with the sarcasm, Fury wailed: ‘My head hurts from all the mind games Dillian has been playing on me! I’m so sore I don’t know whether I’m coming or going. My training camp is a mess. ‘I’m going to absolutely bust Dillian Whyte like a cheap water balloon. ‘And when I’m finished with him, Joe Parker [next to him in the video] is going to set upon him. Because you’re useless you big dosser.’ Whyte will be fighting for the first time since March 2021 when he secured an emphatic revenge victory over Alexander Povetkin. The Brixton heavyweight had been due to meet Otto Wallin, a former Fury opponent, in October, but was forced to shelve those plans after suffering a shoulder injury.
