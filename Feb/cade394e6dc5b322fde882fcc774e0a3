Alexander Zverev has been withdrawn from the Mexican Open after a violent outburst saw him repeatedly hit an umpire’s chair with his racquet and shout expletives in his direction. The shocking incident occurred after Zverev and doubles partner Marcelo Melo lost 2-6, 6-4, 10-6 against Harri Heliovaara and Lloyd Glasspool in the round of 16 on Wednesday. Clearly disappointed with the outcome of the match, Zverev shook hands with his opponents before approaching the umpire’s chair and hitting it repeatedly with his racquet. The Olympic champion then briefly sat down before standing back up and taking another swipe at the umpire’s chair, shouting expletives in his direction. ‘You f*****g destroyed the whole f*****g match. The whole f****** match,’ shouted the German. During the crucial tie-break, world No.3 Zverev believed a ball was incorrectly called out and began yelling at the umpire, with the crowd taking the official’s side. Britain’s Glasspool and Finland’s Heliovaara then saw out the match with an ace, leading to Zverev’s fit of rage. As a result of his behaviour the ATP released a brief statement confirming he’d been withdrawn from the tournament. ‘Due to unsportsmanlike conduct at the conclusion of his doubles match on Tuesday night, Alexander Zverev has been withdrawn from the tournament in Acapulco,’ a statement read. The ATP defines unsportsmanlike conduct as ‘any misconduct by a player that is clearly abusive or detrimental to the success of a tournament, ATP and/or the sport.’ It means the 24-year-old will no longer be competing in the singles draw as he was scheduled to face Peter Gojowczyk on Thursday in the round of 16. The German. who is the defending champion in the singles, will no doubt be punished for his behaviour with the ATP likely to hand him a hefty fine at the very least.
