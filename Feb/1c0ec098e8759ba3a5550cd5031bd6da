The 28th Screen Actors Guild Awards are here, and with them come a whole load of red carpet looks. Don’t worry if you’re only here for those dresses, rather than the actual awards bit – we won’t judge. From HoYeon Jung to Selena Gomez, this event is set to deliver some seriously stunning outfits. Ahead, we’ll be documenting all the best celeb red carpet looks, updated live as the stars arrive in Santa Monica, California. (The order, by the way, is alphabetical, by first name. We’re not fans of ranking by our style preferences) Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
