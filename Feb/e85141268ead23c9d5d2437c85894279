Manchester City and Ukraine defender and Oleksandr Zinchenko has spoken out against Russia’s hostility towards his homeland. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has sent troops to eastern Ukraine after recognising the independence of the two separatist-held regions Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia now has over 150,000 troops on the border, with many concerned that the move will be the start of a full-scale invasion. Zinchenko used to play for Shakhtar Donetsk at youth level before he moved to Russia with his mother after war broke out in the Donbas region in 2014. And the 25-year-old has hit out at Russia’s aggression and says Ukraine’s borders ‘must remain intact.’ ‘My country belongs to Ukrainians and no one will ever be able to appropriate it,’ Zinchenko wrote in a post on Instagram. ‘We will not give it away. I can’t stand back and [not] put my point across. The whole civilised world is concerned about the situation in my country. ‘The country in which I was born and raised and of which the colours of I defend in the international sports arena. ‘The country we are trying to glorify and develop. A country whose borders must remain intact.’ The 25-year-old joined Manchester City in 2016 and has gone on to be capped 48 times by Ukraine. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
