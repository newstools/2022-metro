A mum has spoken of her shock after her five-year-old daughter was able to leave school and walk to the supermarket where she works — more than half a mile away. Talor Hartshorne was on shift at a B&M store when she suddenly spotted her daughter, Maisie Glynn, standing next to her. Maisie, who is in year one, had managed to leave the grounds of Batley Parish Junior, Infant and Nursery School without anyone noticing during her lunch break. She made the walk – which takes around 10 minutes – to her mum’s workplace in Batley, West Yorkshire. Luckily she was unhurt in the incident but Talor said it could have been much worse. The fuming mum has now pulled her child out of school in disgust. She said: ‘She was in the school playing and having her lunch, then managed to leave the school grounds and head into Batley without any of the teachers realising she was missing. ‘I was at work at the supermarket and turned round and my daughter was there. ‘I took her back to school to find out what was going on and they didn’t know she had gone. It’s disgusting to have allowed that to happen. ‘She’s only five years old. It was very lucky that I was in a place that she has visited before. ‘It could have been a very different situation. It’s a very busy town. ‘I have now taken my daughter out of that school. I told them that they are not to be trusted.’ Philip Sunter, headteacher at Batley Parish Junior, Infant and Nursery School, said it had launched a probe into the incident that took place last Tuesday. He added: ‘The safety of all of our pupils is always our number one priority and we are thoroughly investigating how this was able to happen. ‘We offer our deepest apologies to the parents of this pupil. ‘I would like to reassure all parents that this is an isolated incident and something we are taking incredibly seriously.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
