A couple who ordered £30 of KFC takeaway claimed it arrived looking like it had been ‘kicked around a football pitch’. Luke West, 18, and Holly Stedman, 19, made the order on Sunday night through Uber Eats but said they were disappointed with the quality of it. They said the packaging was ripped, everything was covered in gravy and the chicken had ‘red paint’ on it – which they suspected was lipstick. ‘It was disgusting. I wasn’t impressed and paid thirty pounds for it to come in a state,’ Holly said. ‘We ordered from KFC’s branch of Wolseley Road through Uber Eats and when we received the food it was ripped and it looked like it had been kicked around on a football field and gravy was all over it. ‘And to top it all off the chicken was covered in some red paint almost as if it had lipstick drawn on it.’ She added when the couple complained to the branch on Wolseley Road, in St Budeaux, Plymouth, they were ‘hung up’ on. ‘I contacted the branch and the way I was spoken to was really disrespectful, and to be quite honest I was hung up on,’ Holly added. ‘They told me I had to contact Uber Eats and they will send back the driver and do a whole new order, half an hour later, I still hadn’t received the order.’ They did manage to get a refund and receive a new order. A KFC spokesperson said: ‘We’re sorry to hear Luke was put off his meal, that’s the last thing we want! ‘We know delivery can be a bit of a bumpy ride sometimes, but we work hard to ensure our food is delivered in finger lickin’ condition. ‘We’ve not had any similar complaints, but we appreciate this isn’t up to scratch so our team is looking into what happened. ‘In the meantime, we would love for Luke to get in touch with us so we can make things right.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
