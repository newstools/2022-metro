Former Strictly Come Dancing pro Kristina Rihanoff has been criticised for ‘insensitive’ tweets relating to Russia’s attacks on Ukraine. The dancer – who is Russian – sparked outrage amongst her followers following a series of tweets, which appeared to back President Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine began on Thursday. Rihanoff’s tweets were branded ‘in such bad taste’ and an ‘absolute disgrace,’ with fans saying they were unfollowing her. One tweet included a cartoon featuring caricatures of Boris Johnson, Joe Biden and Justin Trudeau.

US President Biden was pointing to the distance, with the words ‘Russian man bad’ written in a speech bubble. Rihanoff tweeted alongside the illustration: ‘Don’t even have to say anything – pure genius.’ The TV star later responded to an article shared by Sky News, announcing that Russia had been banned from Eurovision this year. She wrote: ‘F….ing breaking news 😂  Are you for real @SkyNews ? WTF! And where are we at with bringing @BorisJohnson accountable for ruining thousands of small business while parting during lockdowns?????? This tweet EVERYTHING WHAT’S WRONG WITH THE UK MEDIA & USELESS @GOVUK #Eurovision [sic]’ Twitter users were quick to call the choreographer out for her tweets, with one becoming embroiled in a heated exchange with her. After branding her tweets ‘completely inappropriate’ and telling her she ‘should be ashamed’ of herself, the dance star hit back: ‘You obviously completely oblivious to how Russians were treated by extremists there for 8 yrs. I have family & friends there abused for simply speaking Russian! So don’t go on my timeline & preach to me U don’t have to follow me either in fact I’ll give you a favour and block you [sic]’ Others responded to her tweets, calling them ‘so offensive,’ ‘shameful’ and ‘vile.’ One wrote: ‘What a stupid and insensitive tweet.’ Another said: ‘Think of those innocent families losing their loved ones UNFOLLOWED’ Rihanoff has expressed controversial views online in the past, most recently in relation to Covid restrictions. She retweeted a statement by GB News journalist Lucy Jones, who has been vocal in her opposition to Covid rules. The tweet read: ‘My uni ‘friends’ today messaged me saying they didn’t want to invite me to group meet ups because of my “views on Covid” & company I work for. Really have learnt who my real friends are the last two years,” the tweet read’ Protests have been taking place all over the world in recent days, including within Russia, with people calling for Putin to end the war. A multitude of public figures have shown their solidarity with Ukraine, as over 120,000 Ukrainians have fled the country, according to UN officials.
