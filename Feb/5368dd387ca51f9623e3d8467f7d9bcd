Ukrainian soldiers managed to maintain control of Kyiv as Russia’s invasion entered its third day. Fierce fighting broke out in Ukraine’s capital after Vladimir Putin’s troops tried to push towards the city centre from multiple directions early this morning. Ordinary civilians are being armed with AK-47s, ready to meet Russian soldiers with guerilla warfare, while residents have been advised to make their own Molotov cocktails. Nearly 200 Ukrainians have been killed so far since Moscow launched its attack on Thursday, while more than 1,000 have been left wounded. NATO has agreed to bolster troops on its eastern flank, while the US, UK and EU prepare fresh sanctions that personally target Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, Putin has shown no signs of de-escalating and even called for the Ukrainian military to overthrow the democratically elected government in a chilling TV address delivered on Friday. But Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky has vowed to stay in Kyiv and refused an offer of evacuation from the US, saying: ‘The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.’ He said Ukraine has managed to keep hold of its capital for now, and said called on the EU to back harsher sanctions on Russia in response to its attack.
