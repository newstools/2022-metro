When Samantha McLintock found out she was expecting a baby girl after her two boys, she wanted to give her nursery a new lease of life. The 32-year-old, inspired by Stacey Solomon’s decor, was keen to build a 3D flower wall – but didn’t want to spend a fortune. After some bargain-hunting, the mum from Hartlepool found some flower panels on eBay and decided to get creative. ‘We initially saw the idea on Stacey Solomon’s Instagram, as she had completed something similar, and we loved it,’ Samantha tells money-saving Facebook group DIY On A Budget UK. ‘We have two boys so we wanted something very girly ready for our first daughter arriving in four weeks’ time.’ After a few months researching, Samantha found some cheaper flower panels on eBay – compared to most £30 per panel options. These ones were £14 per panel and were 30cm by 40cm – so 30 were required to fill the wall in total. The mum adds: ‘We then had to find the best way of putting them on the wall and settled for a staple gun. ‘It seems strange but it worked the best as panel pins kept coming loose.’ In total, the 3D nursery project cost Samantha £392 – so she managed to achieve the dream flower wall for less than half price. The 32-year-old is now encouraging others to get experimental with their home decor and spend some time researching the best options for their ideas. She adds: ‘If I was to give any tips, it would be to explore your mad ideas.’ In Samantha’s case, it certainly paid off. Do you have a story to share?
