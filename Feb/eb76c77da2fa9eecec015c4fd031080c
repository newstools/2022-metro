Family Reunion star Jaida Benjamin has been reported missing. The actress, who is known for playing Kelly in the Netflix sitcom, was last seen in the Los Angeles area on Tujunga Avenue and Ventura Boulevard on February 19, LAPD has said. She was wearing a purple crop top, pink jogging shorts, white trainers and wears locs in her hair. Benjamin’s family has been unable to contact her since she was last seen on Saturday, and the LAPD suspects there is no foul play involved at this time. Her mother, Jocinda Benjamin, made a plea to the public for help finding her daughter on Instagram. ‘Never thought I’d ever have to make this type of post,’ she said. ‘My baby is missing. Please help me find her. I can’t breathe.’ Anyone with information regarding Benjamin’s whereabouts, or this case, is asked to call the LAPD’s Missing Persons Unit. Benjamin’s aunt, Jihan Johnston, has been calling for her safe return on social media. ‘My niece has been missing since Saturday!! We just want her home or to know she’s ok!’ she wrote. ‘As we enter 2.22.22, I’m manifesting that my niece appears,’ Jihan penned in another post. ‘Her family wants her home.’ Prior to landing her role in Family Reunion in 2019, Benjamin had bit parts in Issa Rae’s Insecure, Mad About You and The Fosters. Her disappearance comes one week after General Hospital star Lindsey Pearlman went missing in Los Angeles. She was later found dead aged 43, with her cause of death to be determined by a coroner.
