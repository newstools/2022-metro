A reporter in Ukraine’s capital had to put on a flak jacket and helmet in the middle of his broadcast after a series of explosions were heard nearby. Several of civilians in Kyiv are feared dead after Russia launched a bombing campaign on the city at around 5am local time. Troops sent by Vladimir Putin are already on the ground in the country, with footage showing tanks rolling across the border from Crimea. In the US, Wednesday night’s prime time shows were interrupted in the eastern half of the country to deliver news of the full-scale invasion. As tensions between the West and nuclear-armed Russia hit a new low, some viewers took to social media to complain that their favourite shows had been cut off. ‘Thanks a lot for ruining The Connors – most people don’t really care for this report’, one user wrote. Another asked: ‘Umm why is Chicago Fire interrupted with the news?’ But while people in the States sitting comfortably on their couches complained, journalists from their country were risking their necks reporting from a war zone. CNN reporter Matthew Chance said he heard between seven and eight explosions  as he spoke to viewers from Kyiv. He looked nervous but still kept his cool as he said: ‘I just heard a big bang right here behind me. I’ve never heard anything like it.’ Chance took the opportunity to put on his flak jacket and helmet as he continued his report from a balcony. He added: ‘There are big explosions taking place. I can’t see them or explain what they are, but I will tell you the US has warned the Ukrainian authorities there could be air strikes and ground attacks as well around the country, including the capital. ‘I don’t know if that’s what’s occurring now but it’s a remarkable coincidence that the explosions come just minutes after Putin gave his speech. Warning: bad language ‘This is the first time we’ve heard anything. It has been absolutely silent. This is the first time. It has to be more than just a coincidence.’ He added: ‘It was so quiet in Ukraine tonight up until those explosions. What we thought was unthinkable until a few hours ago, is now underway.’ Meanwhile CBS reporter Charlie D’Agata appeared shaken after hearing several loud bangs. He was taken off guard as a fighter jet suddenly flew overhead and he looked around to see if he was in danger. ‘We had always been expecting something major to happen. We thought an invasion might begin with air strikes,’ he added. ‘We heard five explosions. Three, followed by two more, and whatever that was!’ he said, referring to the aircraft that had just flown by.’ Australian war correspondent and photojournalist Bryce Wilson was reporting yesterday from Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, as Putin announced a military operation. As he filmed his brief on the situation, a hypersonic missile whizzed overhead. He shouted: ‘Oh f***, that’s a missile! That’s a missile! That’s a f***ing missile, Holy s***!’ He looked started as he said: ‘OK. We’ve got to f***ing get inside. I can’t f***ing believe that.’ As his footage went viral online, people from across the world sent their best wishes to the journalist from Melbourne. ‘Must be a terrifying experience. Prayers that he and his crew stay safe,’ one woman tweeted. Wilson later told his followers that he made it to safety. He added: ‘There is still shelling going on around here. I’m taking care of my colleagues and myself. ‘Situation is dynamic and dangerous. People are still going to work and acting like this isn’t a war. I can’t believe what is happening here. F***.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
