Rio Ferdinand highlighted Cristiano Ronaldo’s clear frustration towards his Manchester United teammates in their 1-1 draw with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday evening. United registered a woeful first-half display in Madrid as Joao Felix’s header put Atletico in front but Ralf Rangnick’s side escaped with a draw following Anthony Elanga’s equaliser. Ronaldo, meanwhile, had another frustrating game for United as he failed to register a shot on target. In one incident in the first half, Ronaldo let his frustrations get the better of him as two crosses were delivered but he was the only United player in the box. After the ball went out of play, Ronaldo threw his arms out and held up a single finger, highlighting the fact that he was the only United player attacking the ball. ‘Cristiano Ronaldo on his own in the box,’ Ferdinand told BT Sport. ‘You’ve got an opportunity to cross the ball against Atletico Madrid away from home, you’ve got to get people in the box, more than one. ‘Here you see the frustrations of someone like Cristiano. He had a quiet night to be fair to him. ‘But who’s in the box? You’ve got him here on his own and you’ve got eight [Atletico] players in red and white stripes against one player in the box. ‘Watch his reaction, it says it all, frustration, throwing his hands out, ‘one player’.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
