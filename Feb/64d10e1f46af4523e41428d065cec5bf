At least one hostage was ‘held at gunpoint’ inside an Apple Store in Amsterdam tonight. Alarming footage on social media showed a hooded man appear to hold a gun to someone’s head on Tuesday. Witnesses at the scene claimed to hear gunfire, with one saying they had to ‘run for my life’ as armed police raced to the scene. A suspect was stopped by police who ‘hit him [with a car] as he ran out’ before checking him for explosives. Amsterdam Police said: ‘Violent images of that collision can be seen. We now know that the suspect had no explosives on his body and medical personnel are now taking care of him.’ Dozens of other people fled the building and nearby restaurants were evacuated at 5.40pm on Tuesday. The hostage situation in the Leidseplein district came to an end around 10pm. Those inside the store have been taken to a police station for witness statements and are being offered victim support. One person told local news channel AT5. ‘I was standing on the zebra crossing opposite the apple store. An employee walked out in panic with a walkie-talkie yelling: “Raid.” ‘At that moment the penny hadn’t dropped yet and I was about to cross the zebra crossing opposite the entrance to the Apple store. And that’s when I heard gunshots inside.’ Officers earlier confirmed ‘a lot of special units’ were on the scene ‘to get the situation under control.’ In an update, they added: ‘We are currently reluctant to provide information about the situation at the Apple Store on Leidseplein to avoid disrupting our investigation and operation.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted Apple for comment.
