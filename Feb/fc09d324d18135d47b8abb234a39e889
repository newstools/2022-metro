Jack Catterall says his dreams have been stolen following his controversial defeat to Josh Taylor in Glasgow on Saturday evening. Many expected Catterall to walk away as the new undisputed super-lightweight world champion following an impressive performance against Taylor, but the Scot won via split decision as two judges ruled 114-111, 113-112 in his favour, while one judge gave it to Catterall 113-112. Dillian Whyte branded the decision as ‘disgusting’, while Johnny Nelson, who was working as a pundit during Sky Sports’ live broadcast, said: ‘I gave Taylor four rounds. I can’t believe it, I’m in shock. Jack Catterall… I feel so sorry for him.’ Catterall has now broken his silence following the defeat and has slammed the judges for their decision. ‘You know what hurts the most, it wasn’t for me I done all of this for my family my team my town and country. My baby girl and misses, our future,’ Catterall wrote on Instagram. ‘Today I should of been waking up with all of the belts. 15 months out the ring, they all wrote me off. F***** me in every way possible for over two years, finally got the fight. ‘Sacrificed everything to fight one of the top p4p ranked fighters, gave him a lesson. For what. Boxing shame on you. Judges [middle finger emoji]. Dreams stolen.’ Catterall’s trainer, Jamie Moore, said after the fight: ‘It’s difficult to put into words. ‘You’re talking about a kid who’s worked all his life for that moment. ‘He gets the opportunity, he performs like that, beats the champion in his own back yard and gets absolutely robbed. ‘Think about the message that sends to people watching that. My son’s 16 and just getting into boxing, he’ll be looking like that and thinking, ‘why should I be getting into boxing?’ ‘It’s absolutely disgusting. Jack’s heartbroken.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
