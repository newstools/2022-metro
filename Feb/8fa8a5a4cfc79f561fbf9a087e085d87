Maccas fans went absolutely wild for the launch of the hotly anticipated Chicken Big Mac when it launched earlier this month. So wild, in fact, that it completely sold out everywhere in just ten days, and McDonald’s had to take it off the menu. That meant thousands never got the chance to experience the double-stacked chicken burger. The sandwich is made of two crispy chicken breast patties, a slice of cheese, lettuce, pickles and, of course, Big Mac sauce between the signature three-layered buns. The new variation of the iconic burger has had some mixed reviews. The team at Metro.co.uk Lifestyle tried it, and we were divided. Ella called it a ‘game-changer’, while Tanyel asked ‘where’s the seasoning?’ and gave it one star. Thankfully, now you’ve got another chance to try it for yourself and come up with your own verdict. But it’s only around for a limited time. The Chicken Big Mac will be back on the menu from March 2 – but only while stocks last. And, as we know from last time, they are likely to fly off the shelves. It officially comes back off the menu on March 15 – so you only have a small window. A spokesperson from McDonald’s says: ‘We have been delighted by our customers’ reaction to the limited-edition Chicken Big Mac. ‘Thankyou to everyone who has made this the UK and Ireland’s most popular launch ever. The demand has been incredible, and we’re pleased to share its back but for a limited time only.’ Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
