A huge Roman mosaic has been discovered near the Shard, with archaeologists suggesting it was once the floor of a dining room. The colourful design features flowers and geometric patterns. Experts say it is the largest of its kind found in London for more than 50 years. The mosaic may have formed the floor of a dining room in a Roman ‘mansio’ – an upmarket motel-type business that offered accommodation, stabling, and dining facilities for state couriers and officials travelling to and from the city. Archaeologists from the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) made the ‘once-in-a-lifetime’ discovery. They were conducting excavations before construction began on a new cultural quarter in the area in Southwark. The mosaic will be carefully recorded and assessed by a team of conservators before being lifted and transported safely away. Once removed, more detailed conservation work on it can take place. ‘This is a once-in-a-lifetime find in London,’ said Antonietta Lerz, MOLA site supervisor. ‘It has been a privilege to work on such a large site where the Roman archaeology is largely undisturbed by later activity – when the first flashes of colour started to emerge through the soil everyone on site was very excited.’ The mosaic is made of two sections, with the larger one measuring 5m x 3.5m. It depicts flowers surrounded by bands of intertwining strands and is known as a guilloche. Meanwhile, the smaller panel measures 1m x 1.5m and features a simpler design. It shows two examples of a pattern known as Solomon’s knot: two stylised flowers and geometric motifs in red, white and black. Dr David Neal, former archaeologist with English Heritage and leading expert in Roman mosaic, has attributed this design to the ‘Acanthus group’ – a team of mosaicists working in London who developed their own unique local style.
