At least 11 people have been confirmed dead in the two days since a powerful earthquake hit Indonesia. The devastating natural disaster struck the island of Sumatra on Friday morning, leading more than 13,000 people to flee their homes. Officials know of 388 people who have been wounded but rescuers are still working through the remains of the more than 14,000 buildings that have been destroyed. Other villagers are believed to be buried under tons of mud that the earthquake sent tumbling down from surrounding hills. Around 42 people are receiving treatment for serious injuries. Of the 11 who have been declared dead in the disaster, six were killed in the Pasaman district and five in the neighbouring West Pasaman district. The earthquake reached a magnitude of 6.2 on the Richter scale – strong enough to create extremely dangerous tremors, although not forceful enough to trigger a tsunami. Generally, tsunamis need an earthquake of around 7.5 to be generated. Nevertheless, the earthquake’s tremors were so intense, they were felt as far away as Singapore and Malaysia. Indonesia, with a population of around 270 million people, is often hit by natural disasters including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. This is because of its location on the Ring of Fire – an arc of volcanoes and fault lines across the Pacific. The last major earthquake in Indonesia was just more than a year ago – last January. The quake, with a magnitude of 6.2, killed at least 105 people and injured nearly 6,500. More than 92,000 people were displaced after it struck Mamuju and Majene districts in West Sulawesi province. A powerful Indian Ocean quake and tsunami in 2004 killed nearly 230,000 people in a dozen countries, most of them in Indonesia. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
