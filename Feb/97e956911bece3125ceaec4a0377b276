Ever wondered why the classic spaceship shape is a little… phallic? Well, one feminist organisation is hoping to flip that script with their new high-tech design. German initiative Wer Braucht Feminismus? (in English, Who Needs Feminism?), has developed an aptly-named Vulva Spaceship as a symbol for promoting more diversity in space. The scientists behind the design say it’s both more sustainable and aerodynamic than its longer counterparts. Designed by WBF Aeronautics, the ship is intended to make it clear that there’s room for everyone in space, regardless of their genitalia. WBF claims that the craft’s shape is ‘surprisingly aerodynamic’, thus will experience less drag as it sails through the Earth’s atmosphere. Dr. Lucia Hartmann, the head of WBF Aeronautics and inventor of the Vulva Spaceship, says in a clip: ‘The shape is surprisingly aerodynamic, creating way less drag when the vehicle punches through the atmosphere. ‘Due to this optimized V-shape, it guarantees maximum fuel efficiency, and its exterior is made of reinforced carbon, enabling it to withstand the most extreme temperatures.’ The organisation has launched a petition to support the project for which they need 500,000 signatures. They plan to use it to lobby the European Space Agency to enable them to launch this rocket. Jasmin Mittag, Founder of Wer braucht Feminismus? and campaign manager of WBF Aeronautics, said: ‘Space is for everyone. With our mission, we prove to the world that gender equality even has a place in space. ‘We are not only inspiring space travel, but we’re also rewriting the gender narrative.’ Do you have a story to share?
