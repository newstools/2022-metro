Prince George cheekily stuck his tongue out while sitting between Prince William and Kate Middleton at a Six Nations match as his parents went head-to-head. The Cambridges took their eldest son, 8,  to watch England beat Wales 23-19 at Twickenham Stadium on Saturday. The result will have thrilled Kate, 40, who was made the patron of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) this month. William, however, was likely disappointed as he has been patron to the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) since 2016. Pictures show the three chatting and smiling throughout the match as they left Princess Charlotte, 6, and Prince Louis, 3, at home. It comes after the royal couple sent a message of solidarity to Ukraine in its ‘brave fight for the future’. The Duchess of Cambridge is known for her love of sport and comes from a family that planned weekends around international matches. After becoming patron of the RFU, she jokily told player Ellis Genge how her new role could make things heated at home. ‘We’re terribly competitive. The fact we’re now supporting two different teams is going to make things interesting’, she said. George is also a rugby enthusiast and plays the sport at school. Kate has said her youngest son Louis’s love for the game comes out in his need to always be ‘in the middle of everything’. The RFU patron role used to belong to Prince Harry, but he was stripped of this when he stepped back as a senior royal and moved to California. Kate is the first member of the Royal Family to take on one of the Sussexes’ past royal patronages. She previously said she is very proud to take up the role – and even escaped teasing on the family WhatsApp group when she showed off her rugby skills.
