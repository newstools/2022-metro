Manchester United’s board have no intention of hiring Ralf Rangnick as their manager on a permanent basis, despite being impressed with the way the German has steadied the ship at Old Trafford. Rangnick was named interim manager in December, replacing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after his dismissal a fortnight earlier. The German has had to contend with a number of issues, such as Covid-19, the hectic Christmas schedule and an unhappy dressing room. But Rangnick has managed to win seven of his 12 league games in charge, losing just once to Wolves in early January. United should arguably have won more of those games, losing leads against the likes of Southampton, Burnley and Aston Villa but the board have been impressed with the brand of football that Rangnick has been able to implement in a short space of time. Nevertheless, Forbes say the club have no intention of hiring Rangnick and that they want to announce a new long-term manager before the season ends. Rangnick suggested he would be open to staying in charge when he took over in December but United have drawn up a shortlist of candidates, with Mauricio Pochettino and Erik Ten Hag the leading candidates. Both are currently tied up with European giants at Paris Saint-Germain and Ajax respectively but United are hopeful that they can convince one of them to move. United hope to speak to candidates in the coming weeks and should all go well, they’d prefer to make the appointment before the end of the season. But much will depend on how the talks go, nevermind the fact that both clubs will fight tooth and nail to hold onto their managers.
