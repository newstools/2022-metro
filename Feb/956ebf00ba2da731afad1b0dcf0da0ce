Antonio Conte has suggested that he could leave Tottenham following his side’s defeat to Burnley on Wednesday evening. Ben Mee’s second-half goal was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Sean Dyche’s side, leaving Spurs with four defeats in their last five Premier League games. The result has left Tottenham seven points behind fourth-placed Manchester United, although Spurs do have two games in hand. Conte has already admitted that his Spurs squad was weakened by their business in the January transfer window, but the Italian has now gone one step further by indicating that he could leave the club by the summer. ‘It was difficult tonight,’ Conte said after the defeat to Burnley. ‘It’s not only tonight, in the last five games we’ve lost four games. ‘It means that we need to… there will be an assessment, an assessment about the club, about me, because I think for me it’s very frustrating to lose the four games in the last five games. ‘For sure, the situation is this. The situation speaks clear. ‘I’m really sorry for the fans, I’m really sorry for the fans, especially for the fans because I think they don’t deserve this. ‘But when you lost four games out of the last five it means the club has to make an assessment, also to speak together, to understand which is the best solution. ‘In this situation the players are always the same. In this club, they change the coaches but the players are the same, and the result doesn’t change. ‘I’m too honest to accept this type of situation. For sure, we will make an assessment with the club. ‘It’s not right, it’s not good to continue to lose and I can’t accept this. It’s not good for no one.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
