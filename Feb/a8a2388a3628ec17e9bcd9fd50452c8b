Staff at a comedy club in Blackpool claims they have had a request for a refund because the Ukraine invasion has made travel from Hull unsafe. They shared what appears to be a screengrab of an email from an unnamed couple of pensioners asking for money back. Owner of Comedy Station Comedy Club Ryan Gleeson claimed the couple first contacted them two weeks ago asking for a refund because one of the couple had Covid. His employee Rob offered to transfer the tickets to another date, but then he claims they received another message on Thursday citing ‘what’s going on in Russia’. Rob refused the request and said that he was called a scam artist so he got his boss involved. Ryan said: ‘This was when threats to find out where he lived started, suggestions of being in cahoots with other businesses, calling him awful names and swearing at him. ‘Again, bless him, Rob was professional and told her he wasn’t going to continue with the conversation and she should email us instead.’ He said more messages arrived so that’s when they went public with the letter.
