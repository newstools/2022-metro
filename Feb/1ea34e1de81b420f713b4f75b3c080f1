The days are getting longer, but there’s one final light festival to attend before the spring and summer days arrive. Next week, on Friday March 4, a lantern festival will see the winter season out with a bang. Illuminate Rotherhithe and Bermondsey’s free event will see two processions of lanterns leave Mayflower Hall in Rotherhithe and St James’ Church in Bermondsey at 5.30pm. A choir and samba band are due to accompany the processions and both will arrive at Southwark Park’s bandstand at 6pm. At this final stop, guests can enjoy music and barn dancing provided by Ceilidh Tree Band. Anyone hungry after the walk will be able to get their hands on pizza, biscuits and cinnamon buns – provided by the local community. You can also get involved in the parade yourself, by making your own lantern at free workshops running this weekend (February 26 and 27). These sessions will invite guests to craft their own paper-and-willow creations – as this year’s theme is ‘trees and everything in nature you find in or on them.’ So if you missed Christmas at Kew or Kenwood – or one of the capital’s other light shows – over the festive period, this is an excellent opportunity to get involved before spring hits. If you’re looking for other exciting things to do in the capital next month, a drag and dog brunch will be running – packed full of live performances, canine treats and delicious food. Elsewhere, there’s a hash brown-themed pop-up that puts the breakfast favourite at the centre of the menu. Also, a pub is opening in one of the pods on the London Eye – complete with a fully-functioning bar, dartboard, wooden barrel decor and whisky serves. Do you have a story to share?
