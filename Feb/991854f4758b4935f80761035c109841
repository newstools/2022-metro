It clearly pays to have friends in high places, after one pal called in the big guns and landed Rylan Clark as the face of his bed shop. Just a shame Rylan didn’t know about this new career development until the posters had been printed… The beloved Ready, Steady, Cook presenter – who recently returned to the airwaves after a stay in hospital – will be the guest of honour at the launch of his friend and former Apprentice star Thomas Skinner’s Bosh Beds. However, in a hilarious turn of events, Rylan revealed he wasn’t told he would be the celebrity guest of honour until he saw posters for the event sporting his face front and centre, in an advertising move Lord Sugar would be proud of. The 33-year-old television personality wrote on Twitter: ‘So @iamtomskinner rings me. “Ry pop down Saturday to my shop opening”. ‘I say course mate v proud of ya (known him for 15 years) He then sends me this… what a p***. I’m gonna kill you. [sic]’ Rylan also shared the promotional flyer for the event, which kicks off at 10am on Saturday in Brentwood, should you be in the area, that shows the former X Factor contestant claiming the new shop is ‘Possibly the best bed shop in the world’. Quite the glowing endorsement, and now, with Rylan’s inadvertent tick of approval, we can only assume crowds will be swarming the shop on the weekend. Tom wrote: ‘So guys! Lot of hard work but we finally got there! My 1st bed shop is opening this Saturday at 10am in Brentwood. I’ve talked Rylan into cutting the ribbon 😂 if your in the area, your more than welcome to pop in. There is a sainsburys car park across the road. See you from 10! [sic]’ Rylan seemed to be back to great spirits, after falling ill in February and needing an extended stay in hospital. Earlier this month he tweeted: ‘Gone and got the flu (not surprised) been in bed for a couple of days. Have lat tested and not Covid thankfully bur won’t be able to go on the wireless tomorrow. Be back soon x. (sic)’ Rylan also shared a snap from a ‘Costa del hospital’ bed, with an IV in his arm, after suffering from a mystery illness. He wrote: ‘Finally home after an extended trip to Costa del hospital. Slowly on the mend. Won’t be on the wireless tomorrow. Resting up. Be back soon.’ The presenter returned to his Radio 2 show on Saturday and insisted he was alive, while GB News journalist Eamonn Holmes yesterday stood up for the star after he was accused of chucking ‘sickies’. He responded to the critic: ‘Sickies? I was ill.’ MORE : Rylan Clark’s estranged husband Dan Neal ‘joins Tinder’ and has a question for potential matches MORE : Rylan Clark reassures fans he’s doing well after a ‘little bit of a dodgy time’ as he returns to The One Show Got a story?
