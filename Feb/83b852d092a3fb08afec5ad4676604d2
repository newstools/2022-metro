German side Schalke have terminated their sponsorship deal with Russian energy giant Gazprom. Russian state-owned Gazprom have been Schalke’s main sponsor for the past 15 years, while the energy firm is also one of UEFA’s biggest sponsors with a deal worth a reported €40 million (£33.4m) per year. Last week, Schalke announced that they would be temporarily removing the Gazprom logo from their shirts following Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine. For their match against Karlsruher on Saturday, Schalke replaced the Gazprom logo with ‘Schalke 04’ on the front of their shirts. But the German club have now gone one step further by announcing that their deal with Gazprom has now ended. A statement from Schalke on Monday read: ‘The board of directors of FC Schalke 04, with the approval of the supervisory board, decided to prematurely end the partnership between S04 and GAZPROM. ‘The Executive Board and Supervisory Board are in talks with representatives of the current main sponsor, and further information will be announced in due course.’ UEFA is also expected to cut ties with Gazprom which would mean European football’s governing body would stand to lose almost £80m as their deal still has two years left to run. UEFA has already taken the decision to strip Russia of hosting the Champions League final in May. Vladimir Putin’s hometown of St Petersburg was due to host the final at the 68,000-capacity Gazprom Arena on May 28, but UEFA has moved the fixture to Paris.
