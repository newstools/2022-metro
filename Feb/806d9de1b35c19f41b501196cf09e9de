Sasan Amir has been photographing wild cats for five years and has become so close to them that many of the predators enjoy cuddles with him. The 27-year-old says these bonds have taken a lot of patience and time. But now cheetahs and jaguars are so fond of the photographer that they even come over and lick him. Sasan says: ‘My favourite big cat is a jaguar because they look unbelievably beautiful and have the strongest bite force of all big cats – twice as strong as a lion. ‘People are often surprised by their beauty but also how brutal they can be. ‘I think the key to getting the picture is patience, the right gear and lowering your expectations. ‘On one occasion a leopard was hiding in some thick bushes, he was close to me, he looked straight at me and then slowly started to take a nap. ‘He realised that I wasn’t dangerous to him in any way and I really enjoyed that he was so comfortable with me.’ The 27-year-old photographer says he hopes his snaps will raise awareness of the fact that many of the creatures are critically endangered. However, he also stresses that he lets the animals come to him. Sasan continues: ‘We have the privilege to be part of this stunning world and it is our responsibility to retain that for further generations. ‘Wild animals should never get trapped and put into cages. You can take the animals out of the wild but not the wild out of animals. ‘They are dangerous predators and not pets. The only reason I have pictures with exotic animals is because they decide to come over to me and not because I want to pet them.’ Do you have a story to share?
