If you haven’t heard about the Greggs x Primark collaboration, where have you been? The 11-piece clothing range features socks adorned with sausage rolls as well as hoodies and bucket hats covered with the famous Greggs logo. And it’s clear Greggs fans have moved quickly as stocks are now running low across the country. In fact, the collection has proved to be such a hit that many of the pieces have been spotted on eBay – just days after the launch – for more than three times their original price. It seems one of the £8 branded bucket hats prompted a bidding war on the site, selling for £26 – more than three times its asking price. But this isn’t the only listing that’s sparked interest. The £18 black hoodie was found listed for as much as £140 online – that’s almost nine times the original price. Elsewhere, people have spotted that a seller is also offering Greggs fans the chance to get their hands on the £14 black joggers for £130 and the £7 five-pack of socks for £60. These mark-ups may look extortionate but there seems to be demand as people are keen to get their hands on the limited edition items. The collaboration is the first time that the two high-street sellers have worked together and all the products in the range are available in the 60 Primark stores across the UK – until stocks run out. That is, unless you’re willing to splash the cash for secondhand ones on eBay. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
