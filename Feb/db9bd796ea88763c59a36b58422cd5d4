Love UK music festivals (and all the mud, glitter and camping that comes with them)? A new job opportunity could be right up your street. Event platform Skiddle is looking to hire someone to attend festivals this summer and will pay them £7,500 for their time. The part-time role will involve capturing the best of each event, producing exciting content and sharing bits across Skiddle’s social platforms. In total the hired individual will attend 11 UK music festivals from May to August this year – which is basically a different one every weekend. The events on the itinerary include both North and South Creamfields, Parklife, Highest Point, Dream Valley and Garage Nation Outdoor Fest, amongst others. Across the 11-week run, the ‘festival reporter’ will get to see the likes of Clean Bandit, Kaiser Chiefs, 50 Cent, Megan Thee Stallion and Bicep – who are all on the bill at different events. As well as paying the reporter to attend some of UK’s biggest festivals, Skiddle will also cover all expenses including travel to and from the festivals as well as meal costs for each day. So the attendee can get the full experience. Anyone keen to spend their summer in wellies (and get paid for it) can apply online. Skiddle have stressed the role will suit someone creative with an eye for fun and engaging content and a passion for music. The hiring team are also looking for someone friendly, outgoing and confident. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
