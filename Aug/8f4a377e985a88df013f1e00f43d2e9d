Kate Garraway has shared that her husband Derek Draper was placed into intensive care after contracting ‘very serious, life-threatening’ sepsis. The Good Morning Britain presenter returned to the ITV daytime programme on Monday after spending the past two weeks caring for her partner, who remains in hospital after ‘fighting for his life’. While Derek is now out of ICU and recovering, Kate confirmed he is waiting for another procedure. Recalling the ordeal, she told audiences: ‘Unfortunately, his kidneys were really badly infected, blocked, and the challenge now is to save them. So, that’s where we’ve been for the last three weeks.’ ‘One kidney is looking really good,’ she added. ‘We just need to look at the other one. He is still in high dependency.’ Kate said she’s not sure why but stressed the important thing is ‘we’re back on the right side Sepsis is the body’s extreme response to an infection, the CDC states. It is a life-threatening medical emergency. It occurs when an infection you already have triggers a chain reaction throughout your body. The CDC says infections that lead to sepsis usually start in the lung, urinary tract, skin, or gastrointestinal tract. Without timely treatment, sepsis can rapidly lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. On Sunday, Kate confirmed that Derek was doing much better after he was rushed to hospital. Taking to Twitter, she penned: ‘Thank you so so much for all your messages of support – they really do mean the world. ‘I’ve been off @gmb @smoothradio as Derek’s health took an unexpected & frightening turn for the worse that landed him back in intensive care & fighting for his life – again.’ Kate shared more details in a post on Instagram, adding: ‘Thanks to the extraordinary NHS teams & his own amazing life force & spirit Derek -please 🙏 God – is back on the right side of it now and I’m so looking forward to seeing you all back on @gmb from 6 a.m tomorrow & @smoothradio – hopefully celebrating @lionesses #worldcup win! Love ❤️ & see you in the morning!’ Derek, a 54-year-old former political adviser, fell seriously ill in March 2020 after contracting Covid. Despite now being free of the virus, he has suffered long-lasting damage to his organs and requires around the clock care. Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV. Got a story?
