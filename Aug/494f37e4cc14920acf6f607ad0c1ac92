A young man who died at Reading station on Saturday night allegedly after an altercation on a train has been named as Thomas Parker. His family released a tribute along with a photo today, saying: ‘Tom was a very kind, thoughtful, and caring son. ‘He was dedicated to his parents, brothers, grandparents, family and friends. ‘He was popular, loving, funny, and hardworking; he was the life and soul of the party. His kindness and thoughtfulness touched the lives of everyone who knew him. ‘We cannot adequately express how deeply saddened and shaken we feel about his death. He will always be in our hearts and minds wherever we are.’ Mr Parker was found injured on a station platform after police were called at 11.43pm. He died at the scene following a ‘needless act of violence’. A 42-year-old man has been charged with murder over the incident. Kirkpatrick Virgo, of Slough in Berkshire, appeared at Reading Magistrates’ Court today charged with murder and possession of an offensive weapon. The British Transport Police earlier said they believe two men had an ‘altercation’ on board before the victim was assaulted on platform eight.
