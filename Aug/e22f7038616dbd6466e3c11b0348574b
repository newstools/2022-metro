A major fire has broken out near Heathrow, sending up so much smoke that the airport has had to change its normal plans and use a different runway than expected. Fifteen fire engines and around 100 firefighters are fighting the blaze in a field in Feltham, with people living nearby advised to keep windows and doors closed. Heathrow Noise, an account which tweets updates on runway operations, said: ‘Good afternoon, due to smoke from a fire off-airport we will be switching back to landing on the northern runway (27R) and taking off from the southern runway (27L). We apologise for the disruption’ However, Heathrow Airport said this had not led to any delays or cancellations as the schedule for flights is still running as normal. A spokesperson said: ‘Due to an off-airport fire, we have alternated our runways this afternoon. ‘The fire is not impacting the operation and flights are continuing as scheduled.’ London Fire Brigade said: ‘Fifteen fire engines and around 100 firefighters are tackling a grass fire on Hatton Road in Feltham. ‘Around six hectares of land is alight, including standing crop, a field, parkland, grassland, a cemetery and an animal sanctuary. ‘The Brigade’s 999 Control Officers have taken more than 30 calls to the fire. ‘Station Commander Paul Casey, who is at the scene, said: “The fire is producing a large amount of smoke.
