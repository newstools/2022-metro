Growing drugs is never a good idea, but most criminals do try to be discreet about it. Now one idiotic drug dealer has been arrested after police found cannabis plants being grown in his own back garden in full view. Officers raided the property in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, on Sunday to find the large plants dotted around the garden. West Mercia Police confirmed one man had been arrested and investigations are continuing. The police force posted pictured of the blatant operation on their Twitter page. They said: ‘This morning officers from B shift carried out a warrant under the misuse of drugs act at an address in Brecknell Rise Kidderminster. ‘One male has been arrested and enquiries are ongoing. Concerned about drugs? Contact us directly or @crimestoppersuk anonymously on 0800 555 111.’ The find has echoes of another cannabis incident which scandalised a Dorset village last month. A parish council was left red-faced after cannabis was spotted growing from their lovely flower display. A local gardener who was passing by made the surprising discovery in and amongst the colourful display. Other local gardeners were unaware the drugs were growing in the flower bed at the time and the local council even posted photos of them all. The cannabis has since been removed, with West Parley Parish Council confirmed the drugs were not part of the original flower display.
