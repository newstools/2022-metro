A TikToker asked Dall.E mini, the popular Artificial Intelligence(AI) image generator, what the last selfies on earth would look like and the results are chilling. In a series of videos titled ‘Asking an Ai to show the last selfie ever taken in the apocalypse’, a TikTok account called ‘@robotoverloards’, shared the disturbing images. Each image shows a person taking a selfie set against an apocalyptic background featuring scenes of a nuclear wasteland and catastrophic weather, along with cities burning and even zombies. Dall.E mini, now renamed to Craiyon is an AI model that can draw images from any text prompt. The image generator uses artificial intelligence to make photos based on the text you put in. It’s a totally free, online tool and you can find it here. The AI took social media by storm recently with people generating memes with its wild results. The image generator is connected to an artificial intelligence that has, for some time, been scraping the web for images to ‘learn’ what things are. Often it will draw this from the captions attached to the pictures. With the exisiting imagery on the internet for the words ‘apocalypse’ and ‘selfie’ it makes sense why Dall.e thinks that the end of the world will look a certain way. Creators of the AI tool have clarified that it may reinforce or exacerbate societal biases as the model was trained on unfiltered data from the Internet. The extent and nature of the biases of the Dall.e mini model have yet to be fully documented.
