Four children, their mother and another child are among seven people who died in a crash involving a vehicle going the wrong way on a highway. A car crashed head-on with a van carrying the children around 2am Sunday on the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway near Riley, Illinois, according to state police. Both vehicles caught fire and six people in the van died – a mother, Lauren Dobosz, 31, four of her children, and a fifth child who was their friend. The children who were killed were a 5-year-old girl, a 6-year-old boy, a 7-year-old boy and two 13-year-old girls. Dobosz was a cheer coach for the Oriole Park Falcons, a junior league football team in Chicago’s Northwest Side. ‘It is with heavy heart that we announce the passing of our beloved cheer coach Lauren Dobosz, along side her beautiful kids Emma, Lucas, Nicholas and Ella and gracious friend Kat,’ the Oriole Park Falcons wrote in a GoFundMe page started on Monday. ‘They have been involved in a tragic car accident and will be missed dearly by the Falcon Family and dear friends. ‘Lauren always made a great impression on everyone she met, she was full of life, laughter, and always a good time. We’re going to miss you Lauren and your spunky, sweet, sassy kids and every so loved friend.’ Dobosz’s husband was airlifted to a hospital in serious condition, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. The driver and only occupant in the Acura TSX, Jennifer Fernandez, 22, of Carpentersville, died. Fernandez was driving eastbound on westbound lanes ‘for unknown reasons’ when she struck the 2005 Chevrolet van. Authorities did not release more details amid a ‘very active and ongoing investigation’, according to the newspaper. The GoFundMe page for Dobosz and the children’s funeral expenses had raised more than $48,000 by Monday night. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
