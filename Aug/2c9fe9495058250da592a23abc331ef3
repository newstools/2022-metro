Footage has emerged of a dramatic stop and search incident in which armed police surrounded a suspected knifeman on a busy street. One officer repeatedly shouted at the man to ‘get to the f***ing floor’ as shocked passersby watched from a few feet away in Ilford, north-east London. The man was said to have matched a description of someone carrying a knife reported by a member of the public. But he was released after no weapon was found on him. The Metropolitan Police officer approached the man shortly before 9pm on Saturday shouting: ‘Get down on the floor. Get on the f***ing floor right now. Hands out to the side. Do not f***ing move.’ The man appeared to have no inkling he was about to be detained as he stood calmly facing the officer pointing what seemed to be a smartphone camera towards him. But he quickly got on the ground as the officer and two colleagues approached him, with bystanders urging him to keep his head down. He then began demanding to know why he had been detained and complaining: ‘You’re pulling my face down.’ One officer could be heard replying: ‘We’ve had reports you’re in possession of a knife so right now you’re detained.’ Detectives have yet to make any arrests in connection with the report. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: ‘At approximately 20:50hrs on Saturday, 30 July, armed officers responding to a report of a person in possession of a knife stopped a man in High Road, Ilford. ‘The man, who matched a description of the suspect that was provided by a member of the public, was detained for the purpose of a search. No knife was found and he was allowed on his way. ‘No arrests were made and no injuries were reported. Enquiries to establish the circumstances of the incident are ongoing.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
