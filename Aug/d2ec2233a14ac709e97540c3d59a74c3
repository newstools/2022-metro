Soon a month-long celebration of Spanish cuisine will be hitting the UK. Gastronomy Month, the ‘UK’s biggest food festival’ of this kind, will run throughout September with the help of Spanish beer brand Estrella Galicia. Hungry diners can sign up to cookery classes, tasting menus and tapas tours in multiple locations. Restaurants joining the festivities include Sabor, Barrafina, Brindisa and Bar 44, among plenty more. Last year, the festival sold out so this year it’s coming back bigger and better with more than 90 Spanish pubs, bars and restaurants taking part, hosting events at a variety of price points. Tickets will go on sale on August 3, so get ready to book in your experience soon. Find out more and book tickets here from August 3. Do you have a story to share?
