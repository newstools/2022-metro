Love Island is over for another year, and the final did not disappoint! Laura Whitmore kicked off Monday night’s finale by serving up a brand new prize money twist right out of the gate before the islanders’ declarations of love left fans in tears. The first results of the night revealed that Tasha Ghouri and Andrew Le Page had finished in fourth place, before Indiyah Polack and Dami Hope were placed third. But who was crowned the eventual winner? The winners of Love Island 2022 have officially been crowned – with Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu and Davide Sanclimenti winning the series and taking home the £50,000 prize! Fans were distraught to discover that for the first time ever, the £50,000 prize wasn’t going to be up for a steal for the couple who were named the victors. While some finalists look like their relationships could go on beyond the villa, others have seen their relationships tested in the final week.
