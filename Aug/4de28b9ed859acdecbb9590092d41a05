Six anti-lockdown thugs who chased and abused a journalist in central London have been convicted. BBC reporter Nick Watt was hounded and threatened by protesters who had gathered in Westminster. The Newsnight political editor had to run after he was surrounded by a mob outside Downing Street. He told an earlier court hearing how he feared for his physical safety when he found himself the target of the group. They turned on him after realising he was wearing a BBC lanyard, an earlier court hearing learned. Mr Watt said he had been forced to fun ‘like an express train’ and felt as though he had become ‘prey’ to the group, who behaved like they were ‘hunting a vulnerable animal’. Now five men and one woman have been convicted of a public order offence over the June 14, 2021, incident. They were charged with using threatening or abusive words or behaviour with intent to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Five were found guilty after a trial which concluded last month, with a verdict being recorded today. They are: Gary Purnell, 45; Martin Hockridge, 58; Alexander Peat, 35; Christopher Aitken, 63; Djazia Chaib-Eddour, 44. Joseph Olswang, 40, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing. All six will be sentenced on August 30. Detective constable James Harold said: ‘A video of this incident prompted a huge amount of online comment and public concern. The behaviour shown by these people was unacceptable. ‘Members of the public, of any profession, have the right to go about their day without being subjected to verbal harassment or actions that put them in fear for their safety.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
