One of the first beavers in London for some 400 years has been found dead. The two Eurasian beavers, one male and one female, became the first of its species to be reintroduced to the capital in March. It was hoped the pair would mate and produce baby beavers, or kits, by the end of 2022. But on Friday it emerged the male in Forty Hall Farm, Enfield, had passed away from natural causes. ‘We are saddened and sorry to confirm one of the two beavers at Forty Hall Farm has died,’ a council spokesperson said. ‘The results of a post mortem have confirmed that the male beaver died of natural causes. ‘In conjunction with experts the beaver enclosure was designed and built to the highest standards to meet Natural England’s requirements in order to obtain the requisite licence. ‘These experts are confident that the environment that has been created is good.’ Once widespread across Europe and Asia, the Eurasian beaver was hunted to near-extinction for its fur and meat in the 16th century. But beavers are making a comeback in the UK, with small groups dotted across England, Scotland and Wales. The hunt is now on for a replacement male to accompany the female as part of the reintroduction project. Footage from their habitat and observations by experts confirmed she is still safe and well. The spokesperson added: ‘It is our intention to find a suitable replacement beaver as soon as it is feasible. ‘Enfield Council is in discussions in respect to another beaver release at the appropriate season. ‘This will also give us time to make some adjustments to the enclosure to further enhance the conditions for the inhabitants. ‘In the meantime, we will continue to monitor the remaining female beaver as closely as possible without disturbing her or the habitat.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
