We know hangovers tend to get worse with age, but it seems there could be a very specific age at which they kick it up a couple notches. According to survey of 2,000 people aged from 18 to 65, commissioned by greeting-card company Thortful, people feel like 34 is the age when hangovers really start to sting. And at 35, respondents reported that hangovers started to last two days – shudder. Meanwhile, we might have to wait until 37 to finally start knowing our limits, 38 is when people start feeling too ‘old’ to go out, and at 39, people reported that they started feeling more drunk after two drinks. At least we might start spending less on booze? Dr Deborah Lee, of Dr Fox Online Pharmacy, said: ‘Little research has been conducted on the severity of hangovers with ageing. ‘However, hangovers are due to the breakdown of alcohol and the persisting presence of its toxic metabolite – acetaldehyde – in the body. ‘Hangovers are likely to worsen with age because the activity of the key enzymes involved in alcohol breakdown becomes less efficient with age. ‘Also, older people have less muscle and more fat, plus the distribution of water within the body alters as we age. ‘The end result is higher levels of blood alcohol which take longer to metabolise.’ Ollie Hunter, 38, of St Albans, Herts, remembers his 34th birthday as ‘a messy one. ‘I went into London with a group of pals and ended up doing shots until 4am. ‘I don’t even remember getting home, but I do remember that from that day onwards I’ve never had another shot of tequila.’ Speaking about his hangover, the design consultant said: ‘My hangover lasted three days – my head just wouldn’t stop pounding.’ Do you have a story to share?
