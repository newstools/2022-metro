Kim Jong-Un has sent a letter to congratulate the Queen on marking 70 years on the throne. The North Korean leader is the latest, and perhaps most unexpected, world leader to mark the Platinum Jubilee today. The exact contents of his letter haven’t yet been revealed. North Korea’s Foreign Ministry simply confirmed on its website Mr Kim sent a letter ‘congratulating the Queen and the British people.’ It comes as tensions between North Korea and the West continue to increase as the number of the nation’s nuclear tests have swelled. Just last week, Mr Kim’s regime launched three missiles towards the sea. The tests took place just hours after Joe Biden left Asia, where he promised to bolster measures to deter the nuclear-armed state. It marked the nation’s 17th round of weapons testing this year. Mr Kim has previously vowed to strengthen his nuclear forces at ‘maximum speed’. Negotiations between Washington and Pyongyang have largely stalled since 2019, due to disagreements over the easing of the sanctions in exchange for disarmament. But the relationship between the UK and North Korea is far different. North Korea has an embassy in London and the United Kingdom has an embassy in Pyongyang, which opened in 2003 and 2001 respectively. Diplomatic relations were established between the two countries in 2000. But in recent years, Mr Kim has criticised Britain for supporting international sanctions against the country over its nuclear ambitions and human rights record. He has also hit out at the UK for participating in a new US-led alliance to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
