George, Charlotte and Louis waved to the cheering crowds as they arrived by horse and carriage for the Trooping the Colour parade. The young Cambridge royals wore their finest little outfits for the military pageant, while sat opposite their mother Kate Middleton and step-granny Camilla. Dressed in a cornflower blue dress, Charlotte appeared to push Louis’s hand down at point and squinted in the morning sunshine as the carriage left the palace. Louis sat between his older siblings and enthusiastically greeted the throngs of people on The Mall. They arrived minutes after several people were arrested attempting to block the ceremonial route. On horseback in their military regalia were Prince Charles, Prince William and Princess Anne. The Queen, meanwhile, was watching from Buckingham Palace, waiting to take a salute from the balcony.   Her Majesty, now 96, is facing ongoing mobility issues and opted to stay at her royal residence for the parade. She will return to the balcony for a second time later today, accompanied by working royals and the Cambridge children, to watch an RAF fly-past. Trooping the Colour kicks off the four-day Platinum Jubilee celebrations, with millions watching at home on the extra Bank Holiday day off. Crowds lined up on Trafalgar Square and popped open the bubbly as early as 8am today. But the true hardcore fans slept in chairs, tents and even on the pavement overnight. The military ceremony – which has been used to mark a British Monarch’s official birthday for 260 years – is being performed by 1st Battalion Irish Guards. Soldiers on the parade are trained to fight but they have spent months perfecting their ceremonial duties for all to see, especially the Queen, who is head of the armed forces.
