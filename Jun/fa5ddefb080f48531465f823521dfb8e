Liverpool have signed Darwin Nunez from Benfica in a deal which could end up costing €100 million (£85.4m). Anfield boss Jurgen Klopp made Nunez, 22, one of his top targets for this summer’s transfer window. Nunez, who has agreed a six-year contract with Liverpool, enjoyed a breakthrough season for Portuguese side Benfica, scoring 34 goals in 41 appearances and impressing in the Champions League. Manchester United also expressed interest in signing the 22-year-old but Liverpool have won the race, securing his services in a deal worth €100m (£85.4m). In a statement released on Monday, Benfica have confirmed that Liverpool will pay €75m (£64.08m) up front plus a further €25m (£21.3m) in add-ons. Nunez could therefore become Liverpool’s most expensive signing, with his deal potentially exceeding the £75m paid to Southampton for Netherlands defender Virgil van Dijk. Klopp views Nunez as an ideal replacement for Sadio Mane, who is expected to join Bayern Munich in the coming weeks despite Liverpool already rejecting two offers from the German champions. Prior to Liverpool’s Champions League draw with Benfica in April, Klopp said of Nunez: ‘Extremely good looking boy, huh? And a decent player as well. ‘Really good, really good. I knew before, of course, but he played pretty much in front of me with his tough battles with Ibrahima Konate. ‘He was physically strong, quick, was calm around his finish. I always say in these situations if he is healthy, it’s a big career ahead of him.’ Liverpool won two trophies last season but hopes of securing a historic quadruple evaporated as Klopp’s side were beaten to the Premier League title by Manchester City and lost the Champions League final against Real Madrid.
