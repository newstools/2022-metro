It looks like Jacques O’Neill’s got his tail between his legs in tonight’s episode of Love Island as spoilers reveal he apologises to Paige Thorne for after yesterday’s Heart Rate challenge. The pair locked horns after the sexy challenge, which saw Jacques’s pulse raised the highest for his ex-girlfriend Gemma Owen, with the rugby player telling his partner she was being ‘pathetic’ for getting upset. But in scenes set to air on Wednesday night, it seems like the contestant is full of regret over his reaction. Jacques pulls Paige for a chat to apologise for how he responded in the moment last night. ‘When you actually opened up and told me why, I was like ok, I apologise,’ he says. ‘I should’ve had your feelings first before mine.’ In the Beach Hut, he reflects: ‘Last night with Paige, I was quite selfish at first – I realised that pretty quick when I spoke to her. I should’ve been there for her straight away.’ Back on the day beds, he says to her: ‘I’d love to prove to you how much you mean to me.’ Will Jacques be able to prove his feelings for Paige? And will it help relieve Paige of her doubts? Elsewhere in tonight’s episode, Dami Hope and Andrew Le Page surprise Indiyah Polack and Tasha Ghouri with a homemade breakfast, and it appears the girls are satisfied with their efforts. ‘My heart is racing for this pancake, you deffo made up, you deffo made up for yourselves,’ Indiyah tells Dami. But can the same be said for Tasha? Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
