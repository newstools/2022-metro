When a performer appears on stage swathed in orange layered chiffon, they’ve made a statement, and in the case of Diana Ross that statement was unmistakable – there will be more costume changes. And there were, five in fact, all part of the wonderful spectacle of a veteran performer still giving her all, her voice defying her 78 years. If you closed your eyes, she (and you) could be young once again… It helped that Miss Ross’s back catalogue contains some of the greatest pop music ever made. Sixties Motown classics from her days fronting the Supremes were ecstatically received. Twenty thousand people joined in with her hand signal to Stop! In the Name of Love and got to their feet for You Can’t Hurry Love and a brilliant extended version of Love Child, where her crack band came into their own. Later danceable hits like Chain Reaction and the irresistible Upside Down were equally adored, while the seventies showstoppers like I’m Still Waiting and Ain’t No Mountain High Enough sounded as wildly dramatic as ever. Even the token tune from the new album, the cheerful If The World Just Danced, worked just fine, sounding like a contemporary Eurovision entry, albeit one sung by Diana Ross. Aside from the Queen (and the choice of Ross to conclude the Platty Joob concert can’t have been accidental) who else must face their own past so often? Even the screens on stage told her life story through images. But this was a great show, boding well for her Glastonbury legend slot in a few weeks. Age is just a number but glamour is eternal, it seems.
