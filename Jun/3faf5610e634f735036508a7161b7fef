Sony has announced a new sales milestone for the PS5 and has pledged to ramp up console production for the rest of the year. Even in the face of shortages, the PlayStation 5 has continued to sell incredibly well. While it has had to contend with both the Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series X/S outselling it, it saw a resurgence this past April. Following its most recent State of Play, which saw several big name reveals like the Resident Evil 4 remake and Final Fantasy 16’s release window, Sony has revealed that the PlayStation 5 has reached a significant milestone. Exactly when this happened hasn’t been revealed, but the PlayStation 5 has now sold more than 20 million units worldwide, something it would have reached earlier had it not been for the shortage of components needed to manufacture the console. This is the reason why so many games are still seeing PlayStation 4 releases, although Sony intends on completely phasing new PlayStation 4 games out in the coming years. Sony will also be ramping up console production for the remainder of the year, no doubt so it can take advantage of the Christmas season. ‘To those fans who have yet to get their hands on a console, please know that we are planning on a significant ramp-up in PS5 production this year and we are working endlessly to make sure that PlayStation 5 is available for everyone who wants one,’ said Veronica Rogers, head of global sales and business operations to GamesIndustry.biz. Analyst Daniel Ahmad has shared further statistics on Twitter. For starters, while the PlayStation 5 took just under 19 months to reach 20 million units sold, the PlayStation 4 managed it much quicker in just over 15 months. Again, this can be chalked up to the PlayStation 5 suffering from console shortages, plus the coronavirus pandemic. Although it did break the 10 million mark faster than the PlayStation 4, making it the fastest selling console Sony has ever made. Sony’s own predictions add that the PlayStation 5 likely won’t surpass the PlayStation 4’s sales until around April 2023. There have been claims that a PS5 Pro will release by 2024, although that doesn’t seem likely considering the aforementioned chip shortages.
