The Queen will miss tomorrow’s National Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral tomorrow ‘with great reluctance’. Her Majesty, who has had health and mobility issues in recent months, experienced ‘some discomfort’ during today’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations. However she still intends to light a beacon at Windsor Castle tonight, as fires are lit across the country in her honour. The 96-year-old monarch waved from the balcony of Buckingham Palace earlier today as the public celebrated her 70 year reign. Today marked the beginning of a bumper four-day Bank Holiday weekend in honour of the Queen’s time on the throne. While the Trooping the Colour ceremony is held every year for the monarch’s official state birthday, this one was extra special. It featured a spectacular display of pageantry from the 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and more than 1,200 officers and soldiers from the Household Division. The display also featured the 1st Battalion Irish Guards alongside hundreds of Army musicians and around 240 horses. It was then followed by by a flypast of the famous Red Arrows, a Lancaster Bomber, Supermarine Spitfires, and Hawker Hurricanes. Prince Louis, four, pulled some very cheeky facial expressions from the balcony of Buckingham Palace, while Meghan and Harry got the chance to catch up with family. ‘The Queen greatly enjoyed today’s Birthday Parade and Flypast but did experience some discomfort,’ the palace said. ‘Taking into account the journey and activity required to participate in tomorrow’s National Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul’s Cathedral, Her Majesty with great reluctance has concluded that she will not attend.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
