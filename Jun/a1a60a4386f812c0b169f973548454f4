Matt Fitzpatrick has become the first Englishman in nine years to win the US Open after a thrilling final-round battle with world No.1 Scottie Scheffler and Will Zalatoris. The 27-year-old finished six under at The Country Club to secure the first major trophy of his career, with his final round including five birdies with three bogeys. The pick of his shots came on the 18th with a brilliant effort from a tricky bunker position which landed on the green. ‘It’s what you grow up dreaming of,’ said Fitzpatrick. ‘It’s something I’ve worked so hard for for such a long time. I’ve got to give myself credit: I had so much patience today. ‘I said to [caddie] Billy [Foster], if I can hit 18 greens today I’d like to think I’ve got a good chance. I nearly did it. I just played so solid all day.’ The 27-year-old was also congratulated by Rory McIlroy, who won the US Open in 2011, on the 18th green, McIlroy told Fitzpatrick: ‘All that work pays off. I’m so happy for you.’ Fitzpatrick is the latest English player to win the US Open since Justin Rose in 2013. Fitzpatrick has also become only the second golfer after Jack Nicklaus to win the US Amateur title and the US Open on the same course. Nicklaus won his second US Amateur title at Pebble Beach in 1961 and then won the US Open at the same course 11 years later. Fitzpatrick became the first Englishman to take home the US Amateur title for 102 years when he won at Brookline in 2013 at the age of 18, with his younger brother Alex caddying for him.
