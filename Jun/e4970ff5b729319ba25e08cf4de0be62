Love Island’s Afia Tonkmor has become the first contestant of series 8 to be dumped from the villa. The 25-year-old lounge host was booted out of the ITV2 dating show after being left single by Gemma Owen’s ex-boyfriend Jacques O’Neill, who decided to couple up with Paige Thorne. ‘Obviously, I’m going to miss everyone in the Villa but I’m going to keep trying to find love,’ Afia said upon her exit. ‘I’m sure Mr Right is out there somewhere.’ Following her experience on Love Island, Afia admitted she’s learned that she can be a bit shy. ‘It takes me a bit of time to come out of my shell,’ she said. ‘But I maybe learned to put myself out there a bit more. I did learn a few things.’ Afia’s exit comes after Liam Llewellyn quit the dating show after just four days. The student, 22, from Wales, told his fellow contestants around the fire pit: ‘Obviously we all came here for the same reason but I haven’t really been feeling I have been giving 100% Liam. ‘I know what 100% Liam looks like and I am miles off that. I’ve been thinking long and hard, this isn’t a spur of the moment thing.’ The remaining Love Island contestants will be treated with two new bombshells on Tuesday night’s episode with investment analyst Jay Younger and model Remi Lambert set to ruffle feathers. Jay, 28, reckons he’s got what most women want. ‘I’ve got a good job, I think I am a good looking lad and I have a lot of fun so I feel like I could add a lot of value to their lives if they add a lot of value to mine,’ he said. Let’s see if he’ll be able to find his match… Love Island continues on Tuesday at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
