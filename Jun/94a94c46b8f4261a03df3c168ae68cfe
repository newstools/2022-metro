Tottenham are attempting to sign Manchester City forward Gabriel Jesus ahead of Arsenal, according to reports. The Gunners have made Jesus one of their top targets for the summer window as Mikel Arteta needs to improve his attacking options before the new season begins. Last week, reports claimed that Arsenal are closing in on a deal for the Brazil international as they are convinced that the player will join them. But according to Gianluca Di Marzio, Tottenham are ‘moving under the radar’ to sign Jesus ahead of their north London rivals. Additionally, the Daily Mirror reports that Antonio Conte is a huge fan of Jesus’ versatility and Tottenham are pushing to land the 25-year-old. City are understood to want £50 million for Jesus, who is keen to leave the Premier League champions in order to secure more playing time. Spurs have the advantage of being able to offer Champions League football to Jesus after their fourth-placed finish in the Premier League last season. But speaking last month, Jesus’ agent insisted that Arsenal are among the frontrunners to sign the City forward. ‘We had discussions with Arsenal about Gabriel Jesus and yes, we like the project,’ Pettinati told Fabrizio Romano. ‘It’s a serious possibility so we’re discussing. ‘There are six more clubs interested in Gabriel Jesus, he’s now focused on final games with Manchester City, then we’ll see what happens.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
