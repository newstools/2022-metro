Andy Murray’s Wimbledon campaign is over after defeat to John Isner in the second round. The 35-year-old fell to 6-4 7-6 6-7 6-4 defeat to the big-serving American on Centre Court, following Emma Raducanu out of the competition following her defeat to Caroline Garcia earlier on Wednesday evening. The 35-year-old maintained his record of never losing in the first round at SW19 by coming from behind to topple James Duckworth on the opening day of action on Monday. And after dropping the first two sets, the Scot threatened to stage another storming comeback against Isner after clinching an absorbing third. But Isner, who his 36 aces across the contest, regained control in the fourth with a superb performance that sealed his first win over the former world no1 in nine attempts. ‘It is no secret I am not a better player than Murray, I may have just been a little better than him today. It was an incredible honour to play him,’ Isner told BBC after his victory. ‘I need to relish these moments, this was one of the biggest wins of my career. ‘To play as well as I did against one of the greatest players ever is a huge accomplishment for me. ‘He is a massive inspiration for us in the locker room and we are lucky to still have him around. I had an incredible serving day and I needed every bit of it to beat him. ‘This be at the very top for me.’ Isner will play Italian 10th seed Jannik Sinner in the next round. Wednesday’s defeat marks Murray’s earliest ever Wimbledon exit, having never previously failed to reach the third round stage in 13 previous appearances.
