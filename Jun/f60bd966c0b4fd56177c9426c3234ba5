The first day of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee is set to be sunny, warm and fine, forecasters expect. Most areas will feel warmer than yesterday, though scattered rain is possible over parts of Scotland and northern England this afternoon, while Northern Ireland will see some rain, mainly in the west, which will be heavier. Scattered showers are likely over parts of Scotland and northern England this afternoon. It will also be cloudier for Northern Ireland where there will be some rain, heavy at times, and mainly in the west. But the Jubilee events, in London, notably Trooping the Colour, are likely to enjoy sunshine, with temperatures in the late teens. Warmer weather will pick up on Friday, which is set to be the hottest day of the weekend, according to the Met Office. Temperatures are set to soar to 26°C in the south, while north-west Scotland is expected to be the warmest on Sunday. Though it will be dry for most, it will be cloudier in the west, with showers or rain at times. Some North Sea coastal areas will feel cool. There is a chance of heavy and thundery showers at the weekend, however, Met Office meterologist Alex Deakin explained. But it is largely expected to be fine and dry with plenty of sunshine across much of the north. The weekend cloud and rain is more likely to impact the south.
