Jack Grealish and girlfriend Sasha Attwood looked picture perfect as they posed for rare photos together at Manchester United star Harry Maguire’s wedding. Wedding season is in full swing this summer as Manchester City player Jack, 26, and model Sasha, 25, attended two nuptials in Europe last weekend, first flying out for Aston Villa footballer Conor Hourihane’s wedding in Mykonos before jetting over to France to watch Harry marry partner Ferne Hawkins. After recovering from the celebrations, Sasha shared a set of photos from Harry’s wedding, including a snap of her and boyfriend Jack posing together against the backdrop of a French chateau. Sasha stood out in a strapless magenta dress that hugged her figure, while Harry donned a pastel blue suit and white shirt. The couple managed to stop the newlyweds for photos on the dancefloor, with Jack standing next to bride Ferne who looked radiating in her white lace wedding dress featuring a thigh-high side split, and Sasha posing alongside Harry who looked smart in a cream waistcoat, shirt, tie and trousers. Sasha, who is close friends with Ferne, is also pictured sharing a tight hug with the bride before pulling pouting poses. She wrote in the caption: ‘One of my beautiful besties and her soulmate got married 🥹💖 @_fernhawkins @harrymaguire93 thankyou for the most amazing few days. It was perfect from start to finish , wish you guys a lifetime of happiness. 💖 fern you looked completely breathtaking. We love you xxx.’ Ferne replied: ‘Love you so much ♥️♥️’ Megan Davison, who is married to England goalie Jordan Pickford, commented: ‘The best day💖💖💖’ Jack and Sasha have after childhood sweethearts after first meeting as schoolchildren, but their relationship has been on and off ever since. Sasha previously revealed how their relationship being thrown into the spotlight amid Jack’s fame has taken a toll on her, explaining that she was bombarded by trolls on social media as her boyfriend grew in popularity, receiving 200 death threats a day during the Euros. Last year, Jack was linked to TV presenter Emily Atack after claims they had enjoyed dates together, but the footballer appeared to shut this down, writing: ‘Please don’t believe everything you read in the newspapers.’ He was then said to be talking to Love Island star Amber Gill, but she promptly denied this on social media. In recent weeks, Jack was also said to have liked pictures of new Love Islander Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu on Instagram. Got a story?
