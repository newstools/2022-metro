A litter-picker found a crisp packet dating back to the Queen’s Silver Jubilee in 1977 – on the same weekend she celebrated her Platinum Jubilee. Hannah Yeldham uncovered the wrapper of Smith’s ready salted crisps over the weekend in Norfolk, and immediately noticed it hadn’t been bought recently. Despite being slightly crinkled, the white and blue packet was preserved with most of the branding still readable even after 45 years – and Hannah had a closer look. It features a competition to win a customised T-shirt – with the closing date being December 31, 1977. That year, the Queen celebrated her Silver Jubilee, which marked the 25th anniversary of her accession to the throne. Writing on Facebook, Hannah said: ‘This crisp packet has been littering our environment for 45 years! and still intact. ‘But the coincidence is that the queen’s Silver Jubilee celebrations were held in 1977!! ‘What a great find on her platinum jubilee weekend!!’ She found the packet while doing a regular litter-picking outing on Hemsby beach.
