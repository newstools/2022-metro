Wales have reached their first World Cup finals in 64 years after an emotional 1-0 victory over Ukraine in Cardiff. Ukraine dominated the opening half-hour with Welsh goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey called into action on multiple occasions, as the home side struggled to contain the likes of Oleksandr Zinchenko, who looked especially lively following his man-of-the-match performance against Scotland mid-week. But it was Wales who took the lead in the 34th minute through a bizarre own-goal, after Andriy Yarmolenko’s attempt to head clear a Gareth Bale free-kick went badly wrong. Yarmolenko thought he had made amends just minutes later when Joe Allen clipped the former West Ham winner in the box but neither the referee or VAR were moved. From there the game opened up with the away side continuing to create good chances but Hennessey and defender Ben Davies proved to be in inspired form. Wales came close to consolidating their lead on multiple occasions with Aaron Ramsey missing a sitter just after the break, while Brennan Johnson hit the post in the 75th minute before Bale was denied just moments after. But Rob Page’s team held on to reach their first World Cup since 1958. The game was due to be played back in March but was postponed following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and the losing side will be devastated to have lost but will take comfort in the support they have received from neutral fans worldwide In Qatar, Wales have been drawn in Group B and will face England, Iran and the USA when the tournament kicks off in November.
