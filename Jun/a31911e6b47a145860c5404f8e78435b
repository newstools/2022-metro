Three people have been charged with the murder of a father who first went missing more than three years ago. Mohammed Shah Subhani failed to return to his home in Hounslow, west London, on May 7, 2019. The 27-year-old’s remains were discovered in woodlands 15 miles away in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, six months later. Now the Metropolitan Police has confirmed three people have been formally charged with the crime. Amraj Poonia, 26, of Farmfield Drive, Horley, Raneel Poonia, 25, of Whitehouse Way, Slough and Gurditta Singh, 25, of Moreland Avenue, are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court today. They have also been charged with perverting the course of justice. Speaking when Mr Subhani’s remains were found, his sister Quirat said: ‘It broke our hearts and shattered our world when we were told Shah’s body was discovered in an abandoned woodland 15 miles from home. ‘This will haunt us for a lifetime.’ Police had previously offered a £20,000 reward for information leading to an arrest or conviction in the case. Scotland Yard said his family have been informed of the development. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
