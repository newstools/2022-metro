Cristiano Ronaldo has urged Erik ten Hag to give Manchester United’s youngsters a chance to shine for the club, with the Red Devils striker ready to offer advice to any who may seek it. Ten Hag has already begun work with his new club after being brought in to take over from Ralf Rangnick. The former Ajax boss will try to turn United’s fortunes around after a dismal season in which they recorded their lowest ever points tally in a Premier League campaign. Rangnick did afford United academy graduates such as Hannibal Mejbri and Alejandro Garnacho cameo appearances in the first team last term. And Ronaldo, who made his name as a youngster at Old Trafford himself, is keen for others to get the chance to do the same. ‘I’m in favour that we should give opportunities to the young generation because they will be the future,’ Ronaldo said in an interview on the club’s website. ‘You have to give them time, the opportunity, and let them grow in a normal way without pressure. ‘They understand, to achieve success you have to sacrifice, work hard, have work ethic, dedication. But of course if the kids ask me for advice I will give my opinion and advice because I want to help.’ The striker also had a message for the United fanbase, saying: ‘What I have to say to the fans is they are amazing. ‘Even when you’ve lost the game, they always support us, they’re always with us. ‘The supporters are always in my heart and it’s the people that all should respect because they are always on our side.’ MORE : David De Gea sends emotional message to Juan Mata as he leaves Manchester United MORE : Roma consider Jesse Lingard move after being offered departing Manchester United star For more stories like this, check our sport page.
