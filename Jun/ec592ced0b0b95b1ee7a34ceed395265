A fishmonger buying a fish would not normally make national news, but this is no ordinary fish, and these are not ordinary pictures. Campbell Mickel, 51, was so proud of his 150kg bluefin tuna he called up a photographer before selling it to a fancy sushi restaurant in Edinburgh. The man he tasked with chopping up the 7ft beast was master filleter William Elliot. At 5ft 5in tall, the 48-year-old Scot was dwarfed by the giant fish on the floor of Eddie’s Seafood Market. Armed with a razor-sharp filleting knife, Mr Elliot looks more like a newlywed on their honeymoon as he snuggles up to the tuna. It took him two hours to expertly fillet the fish into pieces before Mr Mickel could sell it on for thousands. Mr Mickel said he would not normally advocate eating bluefin but this was not an endangered ‘wild’ fish. It was captured at a young age and farmed in a pen in the Mediterranean until it matured and fattened up. ‘You can’t comprehend the size of this fish until you see it in real life,’ Mr Mickel said. He spent nearly three months sourcing the tuna, which will be super frozen at -60C to protect its quality for the chefs at Bentoya and Kenji sushi restaurants. Bluefin is ‘as good as it gets’ for sushi chefs, but soaring demand for its prized flesh has contributed to overfishing and illegal black markets. ‘We don’t normally deal with bluefin tuna,’ Mr Mickel added. ‘But because this was a farmed product I wanted to try it. ‘For a sushi restaurant this fish is as good as it gets, it’s the creme de la creme – it’s their lobster, caviar and champagne all in one meal.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
