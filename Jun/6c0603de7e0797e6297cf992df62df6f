Are your kids crying out for something sweet, but there’s no ice cream van in sight? Don’t panic – we’ve got you covered. This week’s kid-friendly recipe is the blackberry freezecake pop – so named because the taste reminds me of cheesecake. These lollies are so easy to make, look great, and taste oh so yummy. You can make them with any berry, but I just love the colour of the blackberries. The measurements depend on how many you need to make, but below is a rough guide.
