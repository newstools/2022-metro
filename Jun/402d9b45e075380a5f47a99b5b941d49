Blind Date voiceover legend Graham Skidmore has died at the age of 90. The star, who was the original voiceover on the Cilla Black-hosted show on ITV, died on December 27, with the news just surfacing. Skidmore was never seen in person on the show, but was affectionately dubbed ‘Our Graham’ and was instantly recognisable for his voice. He was also known for his voiceover alongside Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer on Vic & Bob’s Shooting Stars,  from 1993 to 2002. Skidmore, a father-of-three, was diagnosed with vascular cancer 10 years before his death, and spent his final years living in Kent. Skidmore’s family have paid tribute, with his son Neil telling The Sun: ‘He might not have wanted to be seen on screen, but he had a celebrity voice – a known voice. ‘He loved it. I do event organising and had a show in London and got Dad to do the voice over. People recognised him straight away.’ Skidmore’s daughter Catherine added: ‘He was a marvellous man. He looked after people and made sure other people were taken care of. ‘He was very modest. He was not a theatrical “look at me” person. He never really wanted his face to be seen that’s why he liked doing the voice overs.’ Blind Date originally ran from 1985 to 2003. The show returned in 2017 on Channel 5, with Melanie Sykes providing the voiceover. Got a story?
