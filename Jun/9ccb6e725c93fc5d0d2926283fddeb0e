A woman in her 40s has died after a car she was in with two children ‘plunged’ into the River Lee in Cork. The children thought to be aged 10 and 11 years old, managed to escape the sinking vehicle and were rescued from the water. They were taken to Cork University Hospital where they were treated for non-life-threatening injuries. The incident took place at Kennedy Quay at around 8.45pm yesterday, sparking a major search and rescue operation. Eyewitnesses said they could only watch as the vehicle hurtled into the river, Cork Live reported. They said the children, were able to free themselves from the car as it sank and started to swim to safety. The body of the woman was later removed from the water by the Irish Naval Services’ dive team, and taken to Cork University Hospital. The results of the post-mortem examination will determine the course of the Garda investigation into the incident. The incident is not the first time a vehicle has entered the water from Cork quay in recent years. Similar incidents took place in 2020 and 2021. On both occasions, a body was subsequently pulled from the water. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
