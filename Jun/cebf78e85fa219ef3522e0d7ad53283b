A unsuspecting sunbather was bitten as a wild boar went on a rampage along a beach in Costa del Sol. The disorientated animal ran out of the sea and charged towards the 67-year-old woman, before lifeguards quickly sounded the alarm. Emergency services were called to El Albir beach at around 11am this morning, while lifeguards chased the animal away from the sunbathers. The woman later sought treatment for a ‘minor’ leg injury at a local health centre, and was given a course of antibiotics to prevent infection. The boar had been spotted in the water by boat crews who had alerted lifeguards on the beach who made an unsuccessful attempt to catch it. It is believed to have made its way from the nearby Serra Gelada Natural Park which stretches across Benidorm, Alfaz del Pi and Altea. Where the animal is now remains unknown. The attack comes days after the nearby holiday resort of Denia prepared itself to use archers to protect tourist from wild animals roaming at night. Officials had considered use strategically-placed cage traps fitted with cameras to allow authorities to track the number of boars making their way into the town – but the trial was not fruitful. Councillors have since confirmed they are in touch with archers – as it wouldn’t be legal to use guns. They hope the marksmen will be able to prevent boars from eating farmers’ crops, causing traffic accidents and trampling over golf courses.
