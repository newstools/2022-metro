Porto have confirmed the sale of midfielder Fabio Vieira to Arsenal in a deal worth £34million. The transfer has been completed for an initial fee of €35m (£30m), with another €5m (£4.3m) worth of add-ons. Vieira, who has primarily operated as an attacking midfielder for Porto, registered six goals and 14 assists in the Primeira Liga last season. The Portugal Under-21 international is believed to have agreed a five-year deal and is set for a medical in London today. Vieira becomes Arsenal’s third signing of the summer after the completion of deals for goalkeeper Matt Turner and Brazilian winger Marquinhos. Commenting on the deal, Arsenal hero Jack Wilshere told talkSPORT: ‘I will be honest, I haven’t heard too much about him but I looked him up on YouTube when I saw the news break. ‘He looks good. Everyone looks good on YouTube but he looks like he has got a bit about him. Six goals and 14 assists from midfield. That’s impressive. ‘We all knew that Arsenal had to make some signings because they are in Europe. They need to get a bigger squad, so they are making moves, which is nice.’ Reports claim the signing of Vieira will not impact Arsenal’s pursuit of Leicester City midfielder Youri Tielemans. Another priority target for the Gunners is Manchester City’s Gabriel Jesus, who worked with Mikel Arteta at the Etihad Stadium.
