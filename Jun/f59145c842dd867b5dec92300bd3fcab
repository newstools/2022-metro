A troublesome teen has been banned from a whole town after launching a campaign of misery on its residents. Keylan Evans, 14, was at the centre of anti-social and threatening behaviour, as well as online abuse in the Worcestershire town of Kidderminster. West Mercia Police were forced to take action following a string of complaints from local businesses and the wider community who fell prey to the teen. He was slapped with a Criminal Behaviour Order (CBO) for ‘causing a significant amount of distress and harassment to local businesses, members of the public and the wider community’. This means Evans, from Stourport-on-Severn, will be forbidden from entering the town until May 2025. Worcester Magistrates’ Court also banned him from being in a group of more than three people in public, outside his immediate family. Restrictions were also placed on his behaviour and communications. If Evans breaches the court’s ban, he could face a hefty fine or even time in prison. Such injunctions are not uncommon but they are lightly exercised. Sergeant Daniel Townsend said: ‘This order will hopefully prevent him from acting in this manner in the future. ‘I hope the CBO provides reassurance to the local community that the police will take positive action in these situations.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
