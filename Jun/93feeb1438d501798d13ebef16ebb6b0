Chelsea’s pursuit of Sevilla defender Jules Kounde continues during this transfer window and the Spanish side will not let him go for less than €65 (£55.6m). The Blues have been interested in the 23-year-old for over a year, making a bid for his services last summer which was unsuccessful. With the summer departures of Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen, Chelsea are in serious need of reinforcements at centre-back and Kounde remains their number one target in the position. They will likely get their man, but Sevilla will not be strong-armed into letting him go cheaply, with Spanish publication Marca reporting that they will not dip below €65 (£55.6m) in their valuation. This is less than the €80m (£68.5m) price tag they put on the defender last year, which ultimately scuppered his move to Stamford Bridge after it had appeared that an agreement had been reached for a lower fee. The deal was so close that Kounde admitted the failed switch to west London affected his performances at the start of last season. ‘Yes, a little bit,’ he told Telefoot. ‘But now I’ve dealt with it.’ Sevilla CEO Jose Maria Cruz has admitted that Kounde is keen to move on, looking for a switch to a bigger club than his current employers. ‘He is happy with us. In the case of Kounde, it is not a matter of money. It’s a matter of him wanting to play in a more competitive team than Sevilla,’ Cruz told Sporting Witness. ‘I am sure he is a player that is attractive for teams like Chelsea, FC Barcelona, Bayern Munich and these types of teams. He wants to play in a more competitive team.’ MORE : Chelsea on verge of first summer signing after Real Madrid’s rival bid is rejected MORE : PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe speaks out on his future amid Chelsea rumours For more stories like this, check our sport page.
