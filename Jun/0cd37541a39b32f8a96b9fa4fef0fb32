Love Island looks like it’s going to be extra juice on Tuesday night, with a teaser hinting at trouble in paradise between Gemma Owen and Luca Bish. The pair have been an item since the last recoupling which saw fishmonger Luca steal Michael Owen’s daughter from Italian stallion Davide Sanclimenti. But judging by the spoiler clip for tomorrow evening’s instalment, it looks like the duo could already be on the rocks. ‘I am not…,’ Gemma says to Luca sternly, before the camera pans to him sighing and looking up to the sky. ‘Don’t roll your eyes at me and be a pr*ck,’ Gemma then snaps. ‘It was a genuine mistake, I’m sorry, there’s nothing more to it.’ While details of their lovers’ tiff remain firmly under wraps for now, Love Island viewers are already speculating as to what it could be about – and some reckon Gemma accidentally called Luca her ex’s name. For those who need catching up, the international dressage rider was surprised last week when her former flame Jacques O’Neill came into the villa. What did Gemma make of Jacques arrival? Well, she previously admitted to the girls that she still finds him attractive. ‘I look at him and I think you are fit, no question, you are fit,’ she told them. Fans are convinced that Gemma’s spat with Luca has something to do with Jacques. ‘Putting my money on it now that Gemma calls Luca “Jacques” and that’s why he’s in a mood,’ guessed one. ‘Does anyone else think Gemma called Luca, Jacques by accident??’ another asked. Only time will tell what caused the couple’s argument… and whether or not their romance survives the episode. Love Island continues on Tuesday at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
