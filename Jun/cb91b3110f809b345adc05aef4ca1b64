Manchester United’s hopes of landing Christian Eriksen have been unexpectedly boosted after Tottenham ‘suddenly distanced themselves’ from a move for the Denmark international. The 30-year-old is out of contract at Brentford at the end of this month following his six-month stint with the Bees. It was in north-west London that Eriksen proved he has fully recovered from the cardiac arrest he suffered at Euro2020 and the Dane has received a number of offers from across Europe. The two most prominent bidders are United and Spurs; with Erik ten Hag and Antonio Conte both keen to reunite with Eriksen. Eriksen played under Conte at Inter, while he spent the end of last year training with Ajax with Ten Hag as he recovered from his collapse. Reports last week claimed Spurs were the frontrunners for Eriksen’s signature as the Dane wished to remain in London but Football.London say Spurs have failed to follow up on their initial interest. It’s claimed Tottenham registered their interest over two weeks ago – before they signed Yves Bissouma from Brighton. Spurs are now ‘suddenly distancing themselves’ from a move for Eriksen, in what is a significant boost for Eriksen.
