Manchester City forward Gabriel Jesus prefers a move to Arsenal instead of Tottenham, according to reports. The Gunners have made Jesus one of their top targets for the summer and have held extensive talks with the Brazilian’s agent and City about a possible deal. But the 25-year-old has attracted interest from Tottenham and Chelsea. Reports last week claimed that Spurs are working in the background to beat Arsenal to the signing of Jesus. But according to the Daily Star, Jesus prefers to join Arsenal over Tottenham as he would get more starts due to the lack of forwards in Mikel Arteta’s squad. The report also claims that Jesus’ preference is to remain in the Premier League, while Arsenal remain in talks to secure a deal. Jesus has just one year remaining on his contract with City but is keen to leave in order to get more playing time ahead of Brazil’s World Cup campaign later this year. Arsenal also hold a key advantage over Tottenham as Jesus has already worked with Arteta at City. Meanwhile, South American football analyst Tim Vickery claims Jesus’ prefers to play in a wider attacking role rather than through the middle. ‘What is he? Does he want to play as a No.9, or does he want to play as a wide striker? He has kind of run away from being a centre-forward,’ Vickery told talkSPORT. ‘I spoke with the Brazil coach about Gabriel Jesus not that long ago and he said that after the World Cup he called over Gabriel Jesus and asked him, ‘Where do you want to play?’ ‘Gabriel Jesus said, ‘I don’t mind’, but the coach said, ‘Obviously you mind, you obviously have a preference, what is your preference?’ ‘And somewhat sheepishly Gabriel Jesus said he’d rather play out wide. This is important for whoever is going to buy him. ‘If it’s Arsenal, I know that Arteta knows him from Man City, but that’s a while ago and things change.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
