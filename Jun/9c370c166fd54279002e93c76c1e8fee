Arsenal should abandon their interest in Everton star Richarlison in favour of a move for Leeds United winger Raphinha. That’s according to Ray Parlour, who believes the Brazilian midfielder could transform the Gunners’ attack. Mikel Arteta is intent on transforming his attack this summer and the club have agreed a £45million deal to sign Gabriel Jesus from Manchester City. The Brazilian is seen as a direct replacement for Alexandre Lacazette but Arteta wants another statement arrival in attack, with the club targeting Everton star Richarlison. Richarlison is keen on leaving Goodison Park after the Toffees just survived relegation to the Championship last term. Arsenal have explored a deal for Richarlison and the forward is keen on remaining in the Premier League if he gets his wish of leaving the club. But Parlour believes the Gunners should target Raphinha instead as Richarlison is ‘inconsitent’ and not as tactically flexible. ‘He (Raphinha) is a top player,’ Parlout told talkSPORT.‘I think any club will be interested in Raphinha. ‘I think Richarlison is a top player, don’t get me wrong, but I think he’s a little bit inconsistent at times, you’ve got to play him in the right position. ‘But certainly Raphinha, he’s shown that he is a top player and I’m sure lots of clubs will be in for him as well’. Fabio Vieira became Arsenal’s first significant purchase last week when he completed a £34m move from Porto to the Emirates. Arteta is happy with his defence but feels the side require more firepower. The Spaniard is still interested in signing Youri Tielemans from Leicester City, though Vieira’s arrival has made that deal less urgent.
