A woman has died after falling more than 100ft while rock climbing on a mountain in Snowdonia. The woman, in her fifties and understood to be from Cheshire, was climbing with her partner when she fell on the 3,261ft Glyder Fach, a peak in the Snowdon range which is the highest in England and Wales. Ogwen Valley mountain rescue team said she was lead climbing when she fell on the rocky Chasm Route on Thursday afternoon. Nearby climbers raised the alarm and rushed to help the woman, who was lost consciousness in the fall. The woman was winched aboard a coastguard rescue helicopter and flown to the mountain rescue team base but air ambulance medics were unable to save her. In a statement, Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue said it responded to reports a climber had fallen on Gylder Fach at 2.30pm. ‘A lead climber took a fall on Chasm Route and was reported as unconscious, nearby climbers moved to help and the Coastguard helicopter winched the casualty but sadly she had not survived,’ the statement said. ‘The climbers then assisted her partner back down the climb to waiting team members and she was looked after at base. ‘The team’s thoughts are with the casualty’s family, friends and climbing partner, the team would also like to thank the assisting climbers for all their help.’ Around the same time, rescue volunteers were called to help a woman in her 30s who descended from the top of 3,000ft Tryfan down the tricky West Face – getting stuck at a notorious accident spot. The coastguard helicopter crew spotted the woman and the rescue team used ropes to save her. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
