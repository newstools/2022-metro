An eBay seller was left £250 out of pocket after he had to refund his customers because Evri delivered clothes instead of a PlayStation 4. Liam O’Rourke, from West End near Woking, listed his console and PSVR virtual reality headset on eBay. They were bought separately by parents in London and Sheffield who were planning to gift the devices to their children. Liam sent the parcels off around a month ago and they were supposed to be delivered by Evri, which used to be called Hermes. But one customer got an ASOS T-shirt and the other received a Boohoo jacket instead. They both thought Liam was ‘pulling a fast one’ and one of the parents had to rush to buy another device so they had it in time for their son’s birthday. Liam said: ‘They were both really cross. I was trying to get the money from Evri so I wasn’t out of pocket but eBay just took the money. ‘I was out of pocket in the region of £250. I was planning to use the money to pay for some decorating at home and instead I had to shuffle money around to make that payment.’ Liam has already received a full refund from Evri for the Playstation and, after settling a dispute over whether the headset was covered, expects to be paid back for the PSVR by the end of this week. Evri said: ‘We successfully deliver 700 million parcels each year and occasionally sometimes things do go wrong. ‘We’ve spoken to the customer and a goodwill gesture has already been paid.’ Nevertheless, the delivery company has certainly lost a customer in Liam who has promised to take his business to Royal Mail in the future. He said: ‘Everything (Evri) said was trying to get out the way of paying the claim, that was their motivation rather than just looking out for me. ‘I’m definitely not going to be using Evri again, I will be telling everyone else not to use them as well.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
