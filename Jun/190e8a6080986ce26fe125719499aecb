A New York City subway rider allegedly slashed his girlfriend inside a station during the morning rush hour. The woman was arguing with her boyfriend on the mezzanine level of the 4 and 5 trains stop at Fulton Street station shortly before 9.30am on Tuesday, police said. Her boyfriend allegedly cut her on the right side of her face as well as the right side of her upper back, cops said. Splashes of blood could be seen on the floor of the lower level of the station in lower Manhattan, sectioned off with police caution tape. Other photos from the New York Post showed the woman with a blood-soaked bandage around her head and face, and wearing a shirt stained with blood, as she lay on a stretcher and was lifted into an ambulance. The woman, who is 49 years old, was transported to Bellevue Hospital and was listed in stable condition as of Tuesday afternoon. Her identity and that of her boyfriend, described to be in his 50s, were not immediately released. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
