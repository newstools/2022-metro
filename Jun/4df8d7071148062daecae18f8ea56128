Dame Deborah James has now raised an incredible total of £7million for cancer research through her Bowelbabe Fund. The former You, Me & The Big C podcast host died on Tuesday at the age of 40, five years after being diagnosed with bowel cancer. In April, the mother-of-two announced that she had stopped cancer treatment and would receive end-of-life hospice care at home having moved from London into her parents’ home in Woking, Surrey. Yesterday, Dame Deborah died at home surrounded by her family but her impact continues to be felt thanks to her tireless work with the Bowelbabe Fund, which she set up to raise money for various cancer charities that helped her following her diagnosis, including the Royal Marsden Hospital where she received chemotherapy treatment and operations. Just a day after her death, the JustGiving fundraiser for Cancer Research UK surpassed the £7m mark as donations continue to flood in. When the fund was just shy of £6m mid-May, Dame Deborah expressed her shock and gratitude in an Instagram post, writing: ‘I believe I may have had the most surreal, mind blowing, humbling 5 days of my life. ‘I cannot thank you for your generosity at launching the @bowelbabefund which now stands at £5.7 million, and to the @dukeandduchessofcambridge for going above and beyond to make a very special memory happen yesterday.’ The author was referring to Prince William making a surprise visit to her home to personally present her with her Damehood, after she received the honour for her charitable efforts. The Duke of Cambridge and his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, released a statement paying tribute to the campaigner following her death. ‘Deborah was an inspirational and unfalteringly brave woman whose legacy will live on,’ the Royal couple said. Tributes have poured in for Dame Deborah, with BBC radio presenter Adele Roberts – who was declared cancer-free this week – writing: ‘My heart hurts 💔 Thank you for everything Deborah. Thank you for being so strong for so long and helping others when you were in so much pain yourself. ‘You are the best of us. Thinking of your family and friends and I am forever grateful to you for helping me and my family ❤️ ‘Rebellious hope forever.’ Piers Morgan said: ‘RIP Dame Deborah James, aka Bowel Babe. A truly remarkable and inspiring woman. Such sad news.’ Announcing her death in a statement, Dame Deborah’s family said: ‘Deborah, who many of you will know as Bowelbabe, was an inspiration and we are incredibly proud of her and her work and commitment to charitable campaigning, fundraising and her endless efforts to raise awareness of cancer that touched so many lives. ‘Deborah shared her experience with the world to raise awareness, break down barriers, challenge taboos and change the conversation around cancer. Even in her most challenging moments, her determination to raise money and awareness was inspiring. ‘We thank you for giving us time in private as a family, and we look forward to continuing Deborah’s legacy long into the future through the @bowelbabefund. ‘Thank you for playing your part in her journey, you are all incredible.’ They added: ‘And a few final things from Deborah…“find a life worth enjoying; take risks; love deeply; have no regrets; and always, always have rebellious hope. And finally, check your poo – it could just save your life.” x.’ MORE : William and Kate pay tribute to ‘unfalteringly brave’ Dame Deborah James MORE : Emotional Lorraine Kelly in tears during heartfelt tribute to friend Dame Deborah James: ‘It still doesn’t feel quite real’
