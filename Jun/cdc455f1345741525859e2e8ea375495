Friday’s here – and the good news heading into the weekend is the weather’s set to stay on the warm and sunny side. It’s set to hit 24°C today across some parts of the UK with temperatures likely to remain over the next couple of days. Influenced from hot air in Europe, the south of England is expected to see the best of the sunny weather. Meanwhile in Scotland, ex-tropical storm Alex will be bringing gale force winds and heavy rain. Met Office forecaster Aiden McGivern said on today’s forecast: ‘A bright start as this weather front clears the way to the east. ‘But an area of low pressure is edging closer in Scotland and this is a relatively deep area of low pressure for the time of year, so some unseasonably strong winds developing. ‘So it is a blustery start to the day even if there is plenty of sunshine around. ‘The potential though for low twenties, especially given a bit of shelter from the wind and given a few bright spells 24°C possible for London. ‘In the south and south-east it is mostly dry and bright during Friday. ‘Heading in to the evening, for many there will be clear spells particularly towards the south and south-east. ‘But for western Scotland more persistent rain moves in from the west, heavy at times and again we’ve got that strong wind.’ The sunny weather is set to stay for much of the weekend though and Aiden added Saturday would get off to a balmy start. He said: ‘A bright start to Saturday, towards the south and south-east pleasant enough 22 to 23.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
