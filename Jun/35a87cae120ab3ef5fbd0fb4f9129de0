Sam Ryder insists the truth is out there when it comes to the existence of aliens. In an exclusive interview with Guilty Pleasures, the Eurovision hero questioned those who doubt extra-terrestrials. ‘Absolutely I believe. If you don’t believe in aliens, you’re not working your imagination enough. I’ll help you, we can chat about it later, we’ll go down that rabbit hole,’ the Space Man singer offered at Capital FM’s Summertime Ball with Barclaycard. Has Sam had any run-ins himself with little green men? ‘I wish! If they’re listening to this, if they read the Metro, get in touch, I just want one experience.’ Since representing the UK at the music contest, coming second, the 32-year-old has gone from strength to strength – and last weekend performed at the Queen’s Jubilee. However, one opportunity has so far evaded luscious-locked Sam… a hair endorsement deal. ‘Not yet, no,’ he laughed. ‘Pantene Pro-V haven’t picked up the phone. Two-in-one… haven’t heard nothing, silent. We’ll see.’ But speaking backstage at Wembley Stadium yesterday, Sam, from Essex, added he was managing to keep his feet on the ground. ‘I’m trying my best, man,’ he smiled. ‘Days and moments like this, they are absolutely incredible, and yeah, you are in danger of floating away and believing the hype. But, ultimately, it all comes down to the support of other people.’ MORE : Sam Ryder rocks his socks off at Capital’s Summertime Ball with George Ezra and Becky Hill among packed line-up MORE : Sam Ryder confirms Prince William and Kate Middleton actually watched Eurovision with the family and backed him all the way Got a story?
