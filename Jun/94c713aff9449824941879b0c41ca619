Ajax star Ryan Gravenberch has confirmed he’s rejected a move to Manchester United as he has already given his word to Bayern Munich. The midfielder is just 20 years old but he already has ten caps for the Netherlands and is one of the most sought-after players in Europe. Gravenberch has amassed over 100 apperances for Ajax in the last four seasons since becoming the youngest player to represent the club as a 16-year-old the 2018/19 campaign. It was Ten Hag that gave the midfielder his debut and he’s tutored Gravenberch through the early stages of his career. Ten Hag has been so impressed with Gravenberch that he attempted to convince the midfielder to join him at Old Trafford. However, the Dutchman has revealed that he had already given his word to Bayern Munich and he’s set to move to the Allianz Arena instead. ‘Manchester United is a very big and nice club,’ said Gravenberch.‘But I already had such a good feeling with Bayern and I had given them my word.’ United remain determined to sign Gravenberch’s international team-mate, Frenkie de Jong. However, Barcelona are seeking around £70m for the former Ajax midfielder but United want to sign him for closer to £55m. Ten Hag wants at least one midfielder this summer following the departures of Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Jesse Lingard and Juan Mata.
