Three students have been diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) at a Welsh university campus, eight months after coming into close contact with a student who died from the disease. Public Health Wales and Ceredigion Council are investigating cases of ‘active TB’ at University of Wales Trinity St David in Lampeter, West Wales. The three students, who have not been named, are are now receiving appropriate treatment and it is thought that they were in close contact with a student who died from the disease in October 2021. Public Health Wales said that the risk to the wider public and students in the area is low. Health chiefs also confirmed they are working with Trinity St David to establish the close contacts of the three people. Dr Brendan Mason, consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said: ‘Following established outbreak control procedures, we have identified individuals who have had close contact with the deceased person. ‘These close contacts have been contacted and screened for TB, three of whom have been found to have active TB.’ He continued: ‘Our investigations have shown that the three individuals with active TB are all closely linked to the person who sadly died in October 2021. ‘TB is difficult to transmit. It requires close and prolonged contact with an infectious individual for a person to become infected.’ The statement added: ‘Therefore, the university community and local residents can be reassured that the risk to the general public is extremely low. ‘We have identified all the close contacts of the deceased person and they are receiving the necessary TB screening and follow up.’ Dr Mason said contact tracing work for the three active cases was continuing.
