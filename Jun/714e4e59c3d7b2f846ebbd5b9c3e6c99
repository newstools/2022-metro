Today’s Red Arrows display over Buckingham Palace has been cancelled due to bad weather. The news was confirmed shortly before 4pm today. The hugely popular aerial display wowed crowds on Thursday when Jubilee celebrations kicked off. The Queen herself watched the action from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. But rain and poor visibility has led to today’s event – due to be the finale to today’s Platinum Jubilee Pageant – being cancelled. The Parade tells the story of The Queen’s seven-decade reign and Britain’s transforming society. More than 10,000 people are involved – including the military, more than 6,000 volunteers, performers, key workers, and 2,500 members of the general public. Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis have joined their parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, in the royal box to watch the pageant. Other royals present include Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Zara and Mike Tindall and Princess Beatrice. The Red Arrows were meant to close the event. Confirming the cancellation earlier today, the Red Arrows Twitter account posted: ‘Sadly, the poor weather across large parts of England this afternoon has forced the cancellation of all of our remaining planned flypasts.’ The display team was also meant to fly over the skies of Torbay at 12.30pm today. But this morning, the unit tweeted: ‘Unfortunately, our display at the Riviera Airshow won’t be going ahead today due to the weather conditions in Torbay. ‘There is extremely low cloud and very poor visibility, outside of the safety limits for display flying.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
