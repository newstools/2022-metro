A feckless wannabe kingpin got caught dealing cocaine after she recorded a video of herself complaining about the quality of her own product. Natalie Jones filmed herself bemoaning the standard of the Class A shipment she had been provided with by a supplier. The 35-year-old came to the attention of police after she left her phone at the house of a relative who raised the alarm. When the mother-of-three’s house was raided in October 2020, investigators uncovered 4.55g of amphetamine, a list of customers and a cutting agent. There were also over 7,000 messages on her phone discussing drugs deals. Cardiff Crown Court was told she could be heard saying the cocaine is ‘f***ing shocking babe’ and that it is cut with ‘fish scale’, a cattle-deworming medication used to bulk up cocaine. She goes on: ‘There is more fish scale than there is coke. I wouldn’t lie to you, f***ing hell I look at you like family, but I swear to God. ‘I don’t know if he’s had the s*** end of it because it’s your last with him…but it’s definitely not worth 520 babe.’ Prosecutor Laurence Jones told the hearing: ‘The phone was going off in the early hours, and when the relative investigated they found text messages which suggested she was involved in the supply of Class A drugs.’ Jones, of Cwm near Ebbw Vale, pleaded guilty to being concerned in the supply of cocaine, being concerned in making an offer to supply amphetamine, and possession of amphetamine. Defending Jeff Jones said: ‘She was in employment as a manager for four years, before she was made redundant due to the pandemic. ‘She began to mix with the wrong sort and became hooked on Class A drugs. ‘Since her arrest she has pulled herself up by her bootstraps. She has recreational outlets and is doing rugby training twice a week.’ Judge Recorder Matthew Porter-Bryant jailed Jones for two years and seven months.
