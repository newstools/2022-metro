If you walked past Tinside Lido in Plymouth earlier today, it’s likely you did a double take. That’s because hundreds of people dressed as mermaids gathered there today, in an attempt to break a world record. Men, women and children wore homemade costumes for the event and had to sit in one place for five minutes. According to the rules from Guinness, to count as a mermaid individuals needed their lower half to resemble a fish – with a flare of material covering their feet – and a swimsuit or bikini on top. Organiser Pauline Barker described the mermaid meet-up as a ‘fabulous turn out’ and a great way to mark the Queen’s Jubilee celebrations in the sunshine. She said 301 were needed to set the world record, and 550 people had responded saying they would come along. Pauline said: ‘It’s a beautiful sunny day, the water is blue, the lido looks amazing, so we are hoping for anything up to 600 merfolk to come along.’ Feast on some of the amazing outfits below… Do you have a story to share?
