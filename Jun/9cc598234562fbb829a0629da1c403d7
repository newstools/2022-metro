Period homes are always a popular choice with buyers. And a new property listing in Debenham, Suffolk, could be just the thing for people looking for a house dripping in history. An incredible Tudor home is up for sale at just under £900,000, with 3,000 square feet of living space spread over two storeys. The beautiful house is made up of four living rooms, four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen and a scullery. There’s also a wisteria-cladded garden, which features an old well and some barns. So talk about an asethetically-pleasing offering. Aptly named Tudor House, the building dates all the way back to the 1400s – making it more than 500 years old. It’s also Grade-II listed and is part of a quaint little village around half an hour’s drive from Ipswich. Naturally, the £895,000 price tag might seem like a lot. But for what the home offers, it’s actually a pretty reasonable deal (in the world of property, at least) – especially when some London properties are on for that price, but are considerably smaller and far less interesting. This can be seen when compared to this London flat up for sale for £575,000 – which has gaps in the floating bedroom floor. As well as this 454 sq ft studio flat in London on sale for £1million.
