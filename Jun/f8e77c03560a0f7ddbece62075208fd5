Love Island viewers were left pretty disgusted and baffled after watching Luca Bish suck Gemma Owen’s toes in front of all the islanders. And no, it wasn’t even during a challenge. Luca has been coupled up with Michael Owen’s 19-year-old daughter for a few weeks, and seems besotted with her. So besotted, in fact, he even sucked her toes a few times. ‘I prefer your right foot, I’d say,’ Luca began, continuing: ‘It’s weird when boys suck people’s toes and that,’ before doing exactly that while massaging Gemma’s feet. ‘Not really,’ Gemma replied. He then sucked her toes a few times, and fellow islanders was just as unimpressed as the viewers at home. ‘Were you about to suck her toes then?’ Paige said, ‘You’re disgusting!’ He then pretended he hadn’t, while Gemma said: ‘Luca, don’t get embarrassed in front of people,’ admitting she ‘likes’ it. He then did it again, leading Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu to admit she was ‘jealous’ while Gemma demanded him to do it again. The rest of the islanders were left partly disgusted and partly amused, while those watching at home were horrified. ‘That toe sucking sequence should not have lasted that long or even begun,’ one viewer wrote. Another added: ‘That toe sucking should have stayed unseen.’ A third penned: ‘Michael Owen has just had to watch Luca suck his daughters toes,’ with several laughing emojis. Love Island continues tomorrow at 9pm on ITV2 and ITV Hub. Got a story?
