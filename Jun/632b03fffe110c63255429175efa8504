Dereck Chisora says he would have ‘smashed the house up’ and ‘robbed’ the university students who goaded Anthony Joshua. The former heavyweight champion confronted a group of students at Loughborough University who shouted abuse and accused him of ducking British rival Tyson Fury last month. Joshua buzzed himself into their building with video footage showing the 6ft 6in fighter standing in the doorway berating the group. ‘Remember you’re running your mouth, because when I bring people up here and I start cracking your glass jaws, none of you will like it,’ Joshua warned. ‘When your jaws start breaking and people start chasing you out of this uni, none of you will like it. ‘Watch your mouths because you don’t know who you’re talking to sometimes. All this public eye bulls**t, I ain’t into that.’ Fellow British heavyweight Chisora, never one to shy away from a confrontation, has now backed Joshua, warning he would have done ‘a lot worse’ in his shoes. Asked for his thoughts on the incident, Chisora told talkSPORT: ‘I’d have done worse. I’d have smashed their whole house up. I’d have robbed them afterwards as well.’ Following back-to-back defeats to Joseph Parker, Chisora will return to the ring on 9 July to take on former world title challenger Kubrat Pulev in London. ‘Del Boy’ is looking to avenge a 2016 defeat to the Bulgarian, losing a split decision in Hamburg.
