Motorists have been warned they could face fines of up to £5,000 for driving with a dog in the car. Used vehicle sellers Choose My Car are urging drivers to brush up on the latest regulations before setting off on any road trips with their canine pets. Research by The Dog’s Trust suggests well over half of motorists do not think it is dangerous to dive with an unrestrained dog. However, the Highway Code’s Rule 57 states: ‘When in a vehicle make sure dogs or other animals are suitably restrained so they cannot distract you while you are driving or injure you, or themselves if you stop quickly. ‘A seat belt harness, pet carrier, dog cage or dog guard are ways of safely restraining animals in cars.’ Breaching the rule can be punished with an on-the-spot fine of £1,000 – rising to a maximum of £5,000 as well as nine penalty points and even a driving ban and compulsory retest. Choose My Car founder Nick Zapolski said: ‘Having your dog loose in the car can cause both them and you serious harm. ‘Not only can it be very distracting, in the event of a crash, a loose dog flying through the air could be fatal. ‘The safest option is to have your dog belted into the back seat, as the passenger seat airbags could also cause your pooch serious harm in the event of an accident. The belts are inexpensive to buy, and simple to use. ‘Most of all, they will keep you and your dog safe, while saving you from the serious implications of breaking the Highway Code.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
