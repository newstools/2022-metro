When a wedding invite drops onto your door, there are plenty of choices to be made – and far more important than ‘chicken or fish’ is the choice of what to wear. With dress codes and your own personal style to factor in, it can feel like looking  for in a needle in a haystack. So to help give you some inspiration, we’ve rounded up 100 of our favourite wedding guest dresses for 2022. There are mini, midi, and maxi options to choose from, as well as something for those who prefer to cover their arms (as well as those who like to show a little skin). We’ve also made sure to include a wide range of fabrics, colours, and prints – minus white or ivory, naturally – so there’s something to suit everyone. Forget browsing the high street in a panic, let us do the hard work for you. Trust us, the only dress that’ll be upstaging yours is the bride’s. Buy for £85 at Chi Chi London.
