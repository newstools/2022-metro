What makes a city a happy place to be? Life expectancy, sunshine, working hours, cost of living and the friendliness of locals are the most important factors that bring us joy – that’s according to a new study by iVisa, anyway. Going off these key elements, iVisa have put together a list of the happiest cities in the world. So, which one came out on top? It turns out Lisbon ranked the highest with 2,801 hours of sunshine a year and a work week averaging around 31 hours. Plus, it was named the second friendliest city. Second on the list was Barcelona – where people have an average life expectancy of 84 years. What’s more, residents work even less hours than Lisbon (at 30 hours a week) and it was ranked 11th out of 40 for cost of living. Athens – Europe’s oldest capital – took the third spot and was commended for its ample hours of sunshine and the fact it ranked 3rd for friendly locals. Overall, mainland Europe did incredibly well in the ranking – with Rome and Madrid also placing within the top 10. Could a lack of sunshine be the reason the UK didn’t fare so well? Our rain-prone cities didn’t trouble the top 10 – but friendly, laidback Brighton managed to place at 13 while Cardiff scooped 19th position. Sydney, Toronto, San José, Istanbul and Bangkok were the other cities to make it into the top 10. So, if you’re planning on moving abroad for a year or two – or even just planning a trip, these cities should be top of your list for a happy holiday.
