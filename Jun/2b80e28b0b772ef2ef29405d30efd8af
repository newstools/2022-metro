Gabriel Jesus has agreed personal terms with Arsenal and is now set to join the Gunners in a £45million deal. Arsenal agreed a fee with Manchester City on Friday and have now agreed a contract until 2027 with the Brazil international, according to Fabrizio Romano. Tottenham, Chelsea and Real Madrid have also expressed interest in signing Jesus but the 25-year-old is now poised to become Arsenal’s fourth signing of the summer following goalkeeper Matt Turner, forward Marquinhos and midfielder Fabio Vieira, who completed a £34m move from Porto last week. Jesus is expected to become Arsenal’s first-choice striker next season following the departures of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette this summer, with Eddie Nketiah also in the equation. Jesus has scored 95 goals in 236 appearances for City and has won four Premier League titles since arriving in England five years ago. Mikel Arteta worked with the player while he was Pep Guardiola’s assistant at Man City and is said to have been a key factor in Jesus’ decision to head to the capital. Arsenal are also hoping to wrap up a deal to sign his countryman Raphinha from Leeds United. The north London side have also held interest in signing Leicester City midfielder Youri Tielemans since the start of the year. In recent weeks however the Gunners have cooled that interest, instead focusing on getting a deal for Jesus over the line.
