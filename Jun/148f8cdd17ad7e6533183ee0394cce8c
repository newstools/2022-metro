Denise Bell and Alan Shaw got engaged nearly 30 years ago when he proposed to her at the checkouts while she was working in Asda. Now in their 70s, they admit ‘life got in the way’ and they delayed getting married several times – but have always wanted to do it. And now they can have their dream wedding in Las Vegas after scooping £90,000 in a lottery win. Denise, 71, said: ‘We’ll get married finally. ‘We’ve always thought it would be amazing to get married in Las Vegas. ‘So, we can do that now.’ She and fiancé Alan, 74, were among eight neighbours in Arnold, Nottinghamshire, who won a combined £270,000 through the People’s Postcode Lottery yesterday. Seven of the neighbours, including Alan, won £30,000 and Denise pocketed £60,000 with two tickets. The mum-of-two currently works with disabled children and children with learning disabilities. But she said before the wedding, she wants to pay privately for a hip replacement. Delighted, Denise said: ‘I can get a new hip! ‘I’ve been on a waiting list for over two years, but now I can go private, which will be great because I’ve been in a lot of pain recently. ‘I was talking to my daughter when I was very sore last weekend and I said to her, “I’d love to win the lottery so I could get my hip done,” and then only a few days later the Postcode Lottery is at my front door. ‘I can’t believe it… I’m lost for words. ‘It’s more money than we’ve ever had.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
