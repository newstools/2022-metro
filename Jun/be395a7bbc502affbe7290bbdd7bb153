Emma Raducanu has progressed into the second round of Wimbledon after an impressive victory over Alison van Uytvanck. Making her Centre Court debut, the 19-year-old sealed a 6-4 6-4 win against the world no46 on Monday evening. She subsequently missed out at Eastbourne with injury fears lingering despite taking her place in last Friday’s draw. 10th seed Raducanu had seen her grass-court preparation disrupted by a minor injury – pulling out of Nottingham just eight minutes into her opening match after suffering a side strain earlier this month. But the reigning US Open champion looked to have completely shaken off that knock as she turned in a resilient and polished performance to advance into the next round at SW19. A double fault from Uytvanck allowed the Briton to secure the first break of the contest midway through the opening set. After showing her grit in some tense exchanges, Raducanu sealed the opening set shortly after when van Uytvanck sent her return into the net, much to the delight of the home crowd. The Belgian started the second set strongly, breaking her opponent’s serve and moving into a 3-1 lead with a vicious forehand down the line. More unforced errors allowed Raducanu back in, however, breaking back immediately to seize momentum and control of the second set once again. With the crowd behind her, Raducanu confidently served out to seal victory. Earlier in the afternoon, Cameron Norrie became the firs home player to secure victory ater seeing off Spain’s Pablo Andujar. The British men’s no1 secured a 6-0 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 during a rain-interrupted start to the opening day. Norrie will take on another Spaniard in Jaume Munar on Wednesday.
