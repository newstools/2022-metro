Prince William has marked Father’s Day with a cheerful portrait alongside his three children. The Duke of Cambridge can be seen laughing with the cheeky trio during a family holiday in the Middle East. William is pictured with his arms around Prince George, eight, and Princess Charlotte, seven – while four-year-old Prince Louis sits on his shoulders. Kensington Palace say the picture was taken in Jordan in autumn 2021, and they are seen against a rocky, desert-like backdrop. William is smiling widely while the children all appear to be laughing. Prince Louis, fresh from his antics at the Platinum Jubilee, can be seen touching his Dad’s face with his hands in the photograph. The duke and his eldest son George are wearing casual, khaki-coloured outfits, and the younger children are dressed in navy and white tops. Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, and William’s children appear in high spirits, similar to Prince Louis’ mischievous antics a fortnight ago, which won him countless new fans. Louis pulled faces as he sat with family members to watch the show. He let out a howl and put his hands over his ears on the Buckingham Palace balcony during the RAF flypast, as his ‘Gan Gan’, the Queen, told him what was happening. The Cambridges also used a photograph from Jordan for their official Christmas 2021 card. In that image, William was sat on a gold pouffe next to Kate, with the two eldest children sitting next to them, while Louis sat on what appeared to be a sheepskin rug at his mother’s feet.
