Last year’s Wimbledon runner-up Matteo Berrettini has been forced to withdraw from the Championships due to a positive coronavirus test. The Italian, who has won on grass in Stuttgart and at Queen’s Club already this summer, announced the news in an Instagram post. ‘I am heartbroken to announce that I need to withdraw from @wimbledon due to a positive COVID-19 test result,” world number 11 Berrettini said. ‘I have had flu symptoms and been isolating the last few days. Despite symptoms not being severe, I decided it was important to take another test this morning to protect the health and safety of my fellow competitors and everyone else involved in the tournament. ‘I have no words to describe the extreme disappointed I feel. The dream is over for this year, but I will be back stronger. Thank you for the support.’ Berrettini, who has been replaced by lucky loser Elias Ymer, was the eighth seed and had been due to face Cristian Garin in the opening match on Court One on Tuesday. His withdrawal follows that of former finalist Marin Cilic, who announced on Monday that he had also tested positive for Covid-19. ‘Hey guys, I am sad to share that I tested positive for COVID,’ confirmed the Croatian. ‘I have been self-isolating and was hopeful I would be ready but unfortunately I am still feeling unwell and unable to compete at my best.’ Cilic, who had been seeded 14th, was regarded as a strong outside bet after reaching the semi-finals at the French Open Both Cilic and Barrettini were in Rafael Nadal’s half of the draw, with Cilic seeded to be his fourth-round opponent.
