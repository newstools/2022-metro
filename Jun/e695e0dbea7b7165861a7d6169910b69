Dramatic pictures show a 20ft sinkhole that swallowed a motorbike after opening on a residential street in south-east London. The huge crater emerged on a road lined with 1930s semidetached houses on Tuesday evening. An unlucky motorcycle owner lost their vehicle when it fell into the void in Bexleyheath. The area was initially taped off by police, while a barrier has now been set up by Thames Water. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: ‘Police were called to Martens Avenue, Bexleyheath, shortly before 9pm to reports of a large sinkhole. ‘Officers attended and cordons were put in place. There are no reported injuries.’ Bexleyheath has a Kent postcode, but is part of Bexley in Greater London. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
