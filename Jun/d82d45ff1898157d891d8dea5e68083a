If UFOs aren’t real, why is one listed as a staycation spot on Airbnb? Airplane travel is great and all, but it’s so last year. Who needs it when you can stay in an actual spaceship, complete with an alien and droid? The Pembrokeshire staycation spot, dubbed the Spodnic, is kitted out with everything a galactic traveller needs, including space helmets, neon lighting, a Tardis-shaped toilet, and a hot-tub. Obviously. The self-contained UFO-style holiday home also includes an outdoor kitchen and dining area, an outdoor shower, a double bed, two bunk-beds and even a private garden. Like all good space domes, the multi-jet hot tub, which overlooks the woodland, seats up to six people — but it’s an extra £50 for cleaning if you want to use it. Rest assured, dogs are welcome on this intergalactic journey — provided it’s arranged in advantage and an extra £10 per pup is paid. When you’re done making crop circles, there’s plenty of natural beauty spots and places nearby to have a fun day out, including Folly Farm,  Picton Castle’s secret owl garden, Anna’s Welsh Zoo, the Preseli mountains, Ty Canol oak woods, and Amroth beach. The Airbnb ad says: ‘Greetings earthlings!! We look forward to welcoming you to Spodnic soon. ‘Release your inner child and enjoy our outer space!! ‘Spodnic is situated in its own private fully fenced and gated garden ideal for rest and relaxation.’ The ad also promises ‘lots of surprises for guests’ and assures potential holidaymakers that ‘this not your usual run of the mill experience’. If you’re ready to blast off on this Pembrokeshire space adventure, prices start from £160 in June. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
