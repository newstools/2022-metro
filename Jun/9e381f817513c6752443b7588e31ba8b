Kevin Hart and wife Eniko sure know how to vacation, with the pair soaking up the sun on a yacht in Italy and giving us all sorts of holiday fomo. Yes, while we await the proper arrival of summer here in the UK, comedian Kevin and Eniko were looking all kinds of cosy as they took in the sights of Capri, disembarking from their lavish boat for a meal on a pier. Kevin, 42, was rocking the quintessential holiday outfit in a black and blue floral print shirt with matching shorts – all about the ensemble – while his wife of five years Eniko, 37, wore a nude string-bikini and orange cover up. Getting serious over a bowl of pasta, Eniko ditched the cover-up with Kevin pointing at something on his wife at one stage during their al fresco lunch. The pair were seated on a long, wooden pier that jutted out over the water, for one of the finer dining experiences we’ve ever had the pleasure of being witness to, as other diners noshed around them. They appeared to be enjoying a date out solo, with their kids, Kenzo Kash, age four, and Kaori Mai, one, not appearing to be joining them for lunch, with Kevin recently filming movie Lift, a Netflix comedy heist film, in Venice. Sharing snaps to his social media of his getaway, the star appeared to be enjoying a drop of his Gran Coramino Tequila, posing with a bottle of the liquor on the luxe yacht as it was out at sea this week. Eniko also shared a series of shots of her alongside Kevin, captioning a trio of photos from the boat: ‘Island hopping off the Amalfi coast..🏝 doing grown up tings.. BRB. 😝.’ It’s really not a bad life, is it? Still, we’re hoping their romantic getaway went off without a hitch, after Kevin revealed earlier this year Eniko was bitten by a shark on a previous trip. The Jumanji actor appeared on The Ellen Show in February where he opened up about their adventurous holidays, admitting there have been points where things got a bit too scary for their liking. Discussing a family getaway, he explained that she was left nursing a painful injury during one particular outing in shark-infested waters. ‘They weren’t worried about me – I caught them a couple of times looking a bit too long and I panicked…,’ the dad-of-four laughed. ‘I did my limit of adventure, my wife pushed it! I said, “We’re done, don’t try to do it no more”.’ While the actor swam back to their boat, he told host Ellen DeGeneres that his partner didn’t heed his warning, and was bitten by one of the sharks. ‘This other shark bit her, my wife got bit by a shark,’ Kevin continued. ‘I was like “That’s what the f**k you get.” She’s got a scar and everything.’ ‘She was doing too much, Instagram, everyone wants a picture… Everybody wants to do all this stupid stuff,’ he said, swirling his arms around. ‘And guess what, this right here looks like bait. That’s what the shark saw. ‘It got her ass, it got her good. Ask me where I was. I was on the boat and I saw it as it was happening. ‘I should have been like, “Yo watch out!” I should have said something but I was so shocked. I was like, “That one’s swimming kind of fast!” ‘She got out and she didn’t get back in for the rest of the trip.’ We can understand why she stayed firmly on the boat this time.
