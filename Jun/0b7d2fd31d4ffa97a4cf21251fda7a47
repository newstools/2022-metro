A Ryanair worker commandeered a plane’s tannoy system to slate the company during a flight. The disgruntled air steward fumed about the firm’s bosses on board a service flying to Manchester from Spain. He told passengers the budget airline ‘don’t listen to their staff’ and that he doesn’t have ‘high expectations’ a customer complaint would be resolved. In the June 8 video, the steward can be heard saying: ‘I do apologise. If you want to file a complaint please do so – go to Ryanair.com. ‘They don’t listen to their staff, they probably care about you more because you give them money. Instead we’re costing them money. ‘So give that a go, see how that goes. After four years I literally – I haven’t got high expectations for them you know.’ A witness said the ‘stressed out’ worker looked as if was ‘going to blow’ before making the announcement. They added: ‘I felt really sorry for him to be honest, he seemed really stressed out.’ A Ryanair spokesperson said: ‘We sincerely regret the comments made by a crew member on this flight from Región de Murcia International Airport to Manchester, which are not representative of Ryanair.’ It was reported earlier this week that cabin crew working for Ryanair in Spain have voted to hold six days of strikes at the end of June and early July. The Spanish-based staff in the USO and SITCPLA unions will walk out for two three-day strikes from 24 June to 26 June and 30 June to 2 July. Ryanair operates out of more than 20 airports in Spain.
