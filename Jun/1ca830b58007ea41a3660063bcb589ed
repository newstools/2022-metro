Feast your eyes on the offerings for these scarecrow-making competitions, both of which have kicked off this week. Truly, you have not lived until you’ve seen a scarecrow version of Freddie Mercury in drag vacuuming up some grass. One competition sees villagers in Dorset compete for the honour of having the best one. This year in the neighbouring villages of Loders and Uploders, an impressive 44 straw figures have been displayed. The theme for 2022 is music icons, and offerings have included the likes of Elvis Presley, George Michael, Kylie Minogue and Elton John. Other famous faces include Boy George, John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Roy Orbison, Alice Cooper, and even the Phantom of the Opera. Passers-by will be able to feast their eyes on a version of George Ezra, who’s posed sitting astride a mini electric car, and The Who’s Keith Moon, who’s sat behind a makeshift drum set made from a set of wooden wheels. The contest will run until June 12, at which voting slips will be counted and a winner crowned. Paul Male, landlord of the local Loders Arms, said: ‘There are 44 scarecrows this year and the standard is very high. ‘There are a few Elton Johns and the George Michael with stubble is incredible. ‘Some people take it very seriously and one scarecrow has a motion sensor and bursts into song when someone walks past.’ A village in Herefordshire is also using scarecrows to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee with a royal-themed competition. A whopping 104 figures so far, including the artist formerly known as Prince, the aforementioned Freddie Mercury, and, of course, the Queen herself stand watch for the weekend.
