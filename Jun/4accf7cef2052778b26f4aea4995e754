An 83-year-old Japanese adventurer has become the oldest person to successfully sail solo, nonstop across the Pacific. Kenichi Horie arrived in the Kii Strait off Japan’s western coast today after sailing his way into the record books. He completed his trans-Pacific voyage in 69 days after setting off from a yacht harbour in San Francisco in March. It was the latest achievement for the octogenarian adventurer, who in 1962 became the first person in the world to successfully complete a solo nonstop voyage across the Pacific from Japan to San Francisco. Sixty years later, he travelled the opposite route. ‘I just crossed the finish line. I’m tired,’ he wrote in his blog after reaching Japan in the early hours of Saturday. He said that his boat, Suntory Mermaid III, would be towed after the sunrise for an expected arrival at his home port of Shin Nishinomiya yacht harbour in the evening. Kenichi completed his voyage after three days of struggling against a strong tide. On Friday he wrote on his blog that he had succeeded but was exhausted and took a nap after feeling confident his yacht was on track to reach the finish line. Kenichi’s return to Japan makes him the world’s oldest person to complete a solo, nonstop crossing of the Pacific, according to his sponsors. A welcome ceremony is expected to be held for him in his home port tomorrow. The adventurer’s accomplishment is not his first, in 1974 Kenichi completed a solo circumnavigation of the world. His latest expedition was the first since his 2008 solo non-stop voyage on a wave-powered boat from Hawaii to the Kii Strait. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
