A cyclist armed with a gun stormed into a Post Office branch in an attempt to rob it. Emergency services swarmed the Park Lane business in Netherton, Liverpool yesterday afternoon, after reports the man demanded cash from the till. When staff refused, it was reported he fired the gun into the air. Witnesses said it looked like a starting pistol. No injuries have been reported and no money was taken before the suspect fled the scene on a pedal bike. But the attempted robbery has left the local community shocked as it is the second in the area this week. He was described as a white, of slim build, with long blond hair, and was wearing a black hoodie and black Berghaus trousers while carrying a black backpack. Merseyside Police confirmed officers will remain in the area while all lines of enquiry are followed. They are carrying out extensive CCTV, witness and forensic enquiries. Detective superintendent Matt Smith said: ‘We understand how shocking this will be for everyone. ‘I’d like to reassure everyone that we will not tolerate our businesses and staff at the heart of our communities being targeted in this manner. ‘We are working tirelessly to find those responsible for these incidents and bring them to justice. ‘We’re in the extremely early stages of our investigation into the incident at Park Avenue Post Office this afternoon. ‘If you were in the Park Avenue area this afternoon and witnessed anything then please speak to our officers at the scene or get in touch with us via our channels, or through Crimestoppers, anonymously. ‘Similarly if you were driving along Park Avenue this morning and have dashcam footage then please review it and let us know if you see anything. ‘All information you hold could be vital to our enquiries.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
