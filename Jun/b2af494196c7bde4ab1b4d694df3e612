Rafael Nadal has booked his place in the second round at Wimbledon after a hard-fought victory over Francisco Cerundolo. Nadal has not won a title at SW19 since 2010 but got his campaign up and running after seeing off his spirited Argentine opponent with a 6-4 6-3 3-6 6-4 win on Tuesday afternoon. In a draining contest that played out over three and a half hours, Nadal took the first two sets but Cerundolo roared back in the third to keep his challenge alive. Cerundolo broke Nadal in a thrilling fourth but the 22-time Grand Slam winner broke straight back before winning the next three games in scintillating fashion, turning the set on its head and sealing victory. The Spaniard is chasing down a calendar-year Grand Slam having already triumphed at the Australian Open and French Open this year. ‘Three years without being here on this amazing surface, it is amazing to be back and I can’t thank [people] enough for the support,’ Nadal said in his post-match interview. ‘It is not a surface that we play very often especially in my case in the last three years I didn’t put any foot on the grass. ‘Every day is a test and I am at the beginning of the tournament and the difficult circumstances [under which] I arrived here. ‘When you play well in Roland Garros it’s not much time between. I used to remember all beautiful days I finished the final in Roland Garros and was playing on the grass at Queens but by body is not allowing me. ‘For me the most important thing is that I am in Wimbledon 2022 and I won the first match.’ MORE : Novak Djokovic’s family are big Venus Williams fans as tennis legends share sweet moment at Wimbledon MORE : Furious Nick Kyrgios hits out at ‘snitch’ line judge in explosive Wimbledon rant For more stories like this, check our sport page.
