A savvy woman has revealed how she transformed her driveway and garden on a budget to create a modern and chic outdoor space. Victoria, who lives in the UK, shared the fabulous transformation on her TikTok account, This English Home. And people were left impressed with her decorating prowess as she shared the before and after photos of the driveway. The fencing that edged the driveway was ten years old and a dull, green colour. Many would have chosen to tear it down and replace it, but Victoria decided to get creative. She used Frenchic paint in an off-white hue called Dazzle Me to reinvigorate the fence. Then to create a more modern look, Victoria added budget-friendly fax hedge screening (which looks like ivy) on the bottom half of the fence. Next she painted her shed and decorative wheelbarrow in the shade Dusky Blush. Then she added a seating area and outdoor rug to provide somewhere to relax in the sun. However, Victoria decided to replace the seating area with an inflatable hot tub set under a white gazebo that is covered in fake ivy and fairy lights. She managed to update the driveway by just using bargain buys from eBay and Amazon. Underneath the video were a high number of interested viewers asking Victoria for advice on their own driveways. ‘Where did you get the garland for your gazebo? It looks lovely!’,’ asked one user. ‘Amazon’ was her reply. Meanwhile, others commended her on the upgrade. ‘Your home is amazing,’ said one awed viewer. Do you have a story to share?
