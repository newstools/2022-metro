Rebel Wilson has a new love in her life and it’s the sweetest thing ever. The Australian actress, 42, has announced that she’s dating Ramona Agruma, revealing her happy news on social media. Sharing an adorable selfie of the pair cosying up, with beaming smiles on their faces, Rebel wrote: ‘I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince… but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess 💗🌈💗 #loveislove.’ Rebel – who has previously dated men – made her announcement during Pride Month, and is said to have ‘never been happier.’ A friend of the Senior Year star spoke to People about her blossoming romance, explaining that she’s in an ‘amazing place.’ Fans are already in love with Rebel’s new partner, taking to her Instagram comments to wish her happiness. She’s had well wishes from famous pals too, with Montana Brown commenting: ‘Love you so much ❤️ lovely people you are 🖤’ ‘Oh wow!!!!! I couldn’t love this anymore!!!!!!!😍😍’, wrote one fan. Another penned: ‘Wishing you all the love, happiness and years of fun memories!!’ Rebel’s new partner is a fashion designer who owns Lemon Ve Limon. Promoting themselves as sustainable, the fashion brand is based in Los Angeles, California and is already a fave amongst Hollywood stars. This is the first time Rebel’s fans have seen her girlfriend, although she did tease a budding relationship last month, telling the publication that the couple had been ‘set up through a friend,’ without naming names. ‘We spoke on the phone for weeks before meeting. And that was a really good way to get to know each other,’ she said. ‘It was a bit old-school in that sense — very romantic.’ The Aussie added: ‘I think going through the process of finding more self-worth, I think that what you want in a partner is elevated and so it’s great to have someone who feels like an equal partner and be in a healthy relationship.’ Rebel shared that she’s also had times where she was ‘putting up with what I shouldn’t have’ in previous relationships, stressing that it wasn’t the case with all of her exes, because some were ‘great.’ ‘It feels different to be in a really healthy relationship.’ Rebel’s last relationship was with Jacob Busch, whose family founded the brewing company Anheuser-Busch. The pair went Instagram-official in November 2020, but confirmed the following February that they had split. Just last November, the Pitch Perfect alum revealed she was putting dating on the back burner after seeing a few people over summer and ‘having a really nice time.’ She confessed that she was single and ‘looking for the right person’ and, well, it looks like she’s found her!
