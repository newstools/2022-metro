Hey, we’ve all been there. You get home after a long day and realise you haven’t planned anything for dinner. You can’t be bothered to think of a recipe, let alone go and buy ingredients, but still need something that’s healthy, tasty, and won’t be turned down by your fussy kids. This recipe is here to help. My easy peasy Boursin gnocchi is, as the name suggests, super easy to make, requiring just a few ingredients, and pleases tummies of kids and adults alike. Oh, and it’s a great vehicle for hidden veg – feel free to swap the peas out for carrots, broccoli, spinach… whatever you fancy. Here’s how to make it.
