Two-time major champion Dustin Johnson has resigned from the PGA Tour to play in the LIV Golf Invitational Series. The American, 37, announced last week he would feature in the Saudi-backed rebel tour’s first event at the Centurion Club in St Albans, having previously spurned their advances. LIV Golf’s inaugural tournament is due to begin on Thursday with a purse of nearly £20million up for grabs. Fellow rebel Kevin Na revealed on Saturday he had resigned from the PGA Tour ahead of the event in Hertfordshire and now Johnson, who has won $74m across his career, has followed suit. Johnson said: ‘Obviously at this time it’s hard to know what the consequences will be but right now, I reign my membership from the (PGA) Tour. ‘I’m going to play here for now, and as for the consequences I can’t comment on how the tour is going to handle it. ‘I don’t want to play for the rest of my life, this gives me an opportunity to do what I want to do.’ By giving up his membership of the PGA Tour, Johnson has excluded himself from Ryder Cup selection. The 2020 Masters champion has been on the winning side for the United States twice before, including at last year’s edition at Whistling Straits. He added: ‘The Ryder Cup is unbelievable and has meant a lot to me, but ultimately I decided this was best for me and my family. ‘All things are subject to change and hopefully at some point it will change and I will get a chance to do that again.’ MORE : Tiger Woods declined $1billion offer to join golf’s Saudi-backed rebel series MORE : Phil Mickelson risking lifetime PGA tour ban by signing up to play in Saudi-backed event For more stories like this, check our sport page.
