A man who allegedly tried to kidnap a teenage girl from a street in Essex will appear in court tomorrow. Luis Palma, 29, is accused of sexual assault as well as kidnapping and possession of cannabis after the incident in Harlow in daylight on Wednesday. The girl managed to free herself and get away, and was not physically harmed. Palma will appear at Colchester Magistrates’ Court tomorrow over the incident near Oakwood Pond just before 4.20pm. Earlier this week, Detective Inspector Daniela Hogan said: ‘This incident would have been very frightening for the victim, who showed such bravery in freeing herself and fleeing the area.’ Temporary Chief Inspector Terry Fisher said: ‘I know this incident will have caused concern in the community but incidents like this are extremely rare and we believe this was an isolated incident. ‘A dedicated team of specialist officers and staff are continuing to support the girl and her family. ‘If you have any concerns or information about this incident, please contact us.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
