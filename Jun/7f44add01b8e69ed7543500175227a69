A bride-to-be was lucky to escape unharmed after a stranger started hacking at her inflatable penis costume while she was out on her hen do. Laura Inglic, 23, was targeted by 27-year-old Ronald McKinnon as she celebrated her engagement with friends in Eaglesham, Scotland, on June 12 last year. Paisley Sheriff Court heard McKinnon had attempted to pop the inflatable outfit in what was considered a random attack. Ms Inglic, who used to play football for Scottish Women’s League winners Bishopton Ladies, was said to have been shaken up but otherwise unharmed. Arrested a day after the unprovoked attack, McKinnon was charged with possessing a knife in public and culpable and reckless conduct by stabbing the costume. He admitted the latter charge, with police concluding that he had ‘repeatedly stabbed an inflatable costume worn by Laura Inglis with utter disregard to the consequences’. McKinnon awaits sentencing, the Daily Record reports. Defending, Tony Callahan told the court McKinnon had struggled with alcohol addiction but managed to turn things around before becoming a dad. Mr Callahan pleaded for McKinnon to be placed on a Community Payback Order under the supervision of social workers. But Sheriff Gillian Craig said she did not believe that sufficient to meet the gravity of the offence. She added: ‘Supervision may be of assistance to your client, but he seems to be fairly motivated to help himself anyway.’ Addressing McKinnon, she went on: ‘In relation to this matter, I’m not going to impose a sentence at this stage. ‘I’m going to defer sentencing again, for a period of four months, and that’s simply to keep an eye on you, sir.’ McKinnon was advised to keep out of trouble and return to court in October.
