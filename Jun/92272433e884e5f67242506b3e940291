A man has been arrested after a severed head was left on the steps of a court building in the German city of Bonn. The 38-year-old was taken into custody ‘without resistance’ after the grim discovery was made on Tuesday. The rest of the deceased’s body was found a short while later lying on the banks of the River Rhine near Alter Zoll. It is thought the suspect walked the one kilometre to the courthouse carrying the head, according to Bild. Police spokesman Robert Scholten is quoted as saying at the scene: ‘We are at work here with the homicide squad. We will inspect both sites and question the provisionally arrested person.’ The report states the victim is believed to be a 44-year-old man. Both he and he suspect are said to have been homeless, although it remains unclear what – if any – relationship they had with each other. No murder weapon has yet been found and investigations are ongoing to determine how the victim died. Police said no suspicious activity was reported in the area, and they are seeking witnesses.
