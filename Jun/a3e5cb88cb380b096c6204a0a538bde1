A firewalking stunt in Switzerland which went badly wrong left 25 people needing treatment. Emergency services were called to a private event near Lake Zurich last night. Several people had been attempting to walk over burning hot coals, a rite of passage which is still practiced in various contexts. According to local police, 13 of the people treated needed to be taken to hospital. The remainder were given medical attention at the scene and limped away. It’s unclear whether the incident on Switzerland’s Au peninsula was part of a religious ceremony or a social occasion. Firewalking is often incorporated into charity or corporate events. It is sometimes used by companies as part of team-building exercises, including in the UK. One British firm offering the practice says it ‘can help with most aspects of corporate team building, motivation, change management or a great stress reliever’. An investigation is under way into the circumstances of the incident. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
