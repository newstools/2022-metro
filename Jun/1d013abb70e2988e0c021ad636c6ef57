Tickets have gone on sale for Robbie Williams’ XXV tour, marking 25 years since the singer went solo, and have proved so popular he’s added extra dates. Robbie will be heading out on tour in October, and fans were clamouring to get their hands on tickets as soon as they went live on Friday at 9am. The former Take That star will perform in cities including London, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham and Dublin across the long-awaited tour. Due to ‘phenomenal demand’ three new dates were added after the tickets went on general sale, allowing more fans the chance to see Robbie live. The news comes after the 18-time Brit Award winner announced his new album, also called XXV, will be released on September 9. The new album is set to feature re-recorded versions of Robbie’s classic hits, including Let Me Entertain You, Millennium, and Rock DJ as well as new material, including Lost, Disco Symphony, More Than This, and The World And Her Mother. It also includes a new version of Angels, which was performed by Robbie during the half-time show of Soccer Aid. Since leaving Take That in 1995, Robbie has racked up seven number one singles and a total of 31 top 10 hits. He is also set to be the subject of a biopic called Better Man, telling Metro’s Guilty Pleasures: ‘I think this is an over-18s movie, blood and guts and drugs and sex and drink and rock’n’roll, losing yourself and finding yourself.’ Tickets are available from Ticketmaster now on general sale.
