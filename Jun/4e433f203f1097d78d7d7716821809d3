The world’s largest cargo ship has come in to dock in the UK. The Ever Ace is the record-holder for the most containers to be loaded on to a single ship. At 1,300 ft (400m) long and 60m (197ft) wide, it can hold some 23,992 standard containers. On Sunday morning, the vessel arrived in the busiest and biggest container port in the UK, at Felixstowe, Suffolk. The vessel, which is operated by Taiwanese shipping company Evergreen Marine Corporation, arrived from Rotterdam and was being unloaded this morning. Pictures show the sheer size of it, taking up a huge portion of the port and dwarfing a tug boat. It was built in 2021, and docked at Felixstowe on its maiden voyage in September that year. It is own by the same company behind its more infamous cousin, the Ever Given, which blocked the Suez canal in March 2021 – sparking global trade chaos. The six-day shambles saw the 20,000 or so containers on board that enormous vessel stranded – and blocking the path of countless others. But Evergreen’s Ever Ace is a newer and even bigger class of container than the Given. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
