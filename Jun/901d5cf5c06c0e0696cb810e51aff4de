For the Grenfell Tower memorial service in London, the Duchess of Cambridge went for classic summer style. Kate Middleton opted for a white silk dress from Suzannah London, complete with a full skirt, slightly puffed sleeves, buttons down the front, lapels, and a nipped in waist. It’s an elegant, timeless silhouette that works on everyone, but be warned: if you do want to copy Kate’s style, it’ll cost you: this particular dress costs a whopping £2,450. No wonder, then, that this is actually a royal re-wear – you’d want to get your money’s worth at this cost. Kate was first seen wearing the dress back in 2020, at Wimbledon. At Wimbledon, Kate paired the dress with black accessories. This time around she gave the piece a fresher look with a simple white belt, a cream clutch bag, and two-tone pumps from Alessandra Rich (usually £540, but currently £320).
