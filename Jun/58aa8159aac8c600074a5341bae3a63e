Scientists have developed a PCR test that detects the monkeypox virus in 90 minutes. The test, developed by South Korean diagnostics firm Seegene, will help countries in monitoring the spread of the virus and curb community transmission. The World Health Organisation expects cases to rise this summer with health officials warning that transmission in Europe could be ‘amplified’ by big events like festivals. The European office of the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that Europe is at the ‘epicentre’ of the ‘largest and most geographically widespread monkeypox outbreak ever reported’ outside of western and central Africa. The monkeypox virus has been detected in over 50 nations, with South Korea confirming its first case last week. The strain currently circulating in the Northern Hemisphere has an estimated fatality rate of between 3-6 % and is considered especially dangerous for children and those with weak immune systems. Timely PCR testing is vital, especially for individuals with a suspected case, as the incubation period for the monkeypox infection ranges between five to 21 days. The new test can identify positive cases of the monkeypox virus in 90 minutes and Seegene plans to provide it to countries that have detected the virus. Moneypox cases in the UK have surpassed 1,000, latest figures from the Health Security Agency (HSA) show. There are now 1,076 infections across the country, with 79 per cent of the cases in London. Dr Sophia Makki, Incident director at UKHSA said: ‘The monkeypox outbreak in the UK continues to grow, with over a thousand cases now confirmed nationwide. We expect cases to continue to rise further in the coming days and week.’ MORE : Number of monkeypox cases in UK passes 1,000 MORE : Monkeypox mutating 12 times faster than expected, experts warn
