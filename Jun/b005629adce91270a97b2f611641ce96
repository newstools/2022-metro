Boris Johnson had a ‘minor routine operation related to his sinuses’ this morning, Downing Street has said. The surgery took place under general anaesthetic at a hospital in London. The Prime Minister arrived at the hospital around 6am before going under the knife ‘first thing’. ‘He was back in Downing Street shortly after 10am,’ his official spokesperson said. The PM is now resting at home, the spokesperson said when asked how Mr Johnson was feeling. He is planning to chair Tuesday morning’s Cabinet meeting as planned. When quizzed about who was in charge of the UK nuclear accounts during the PM’s procedure, his spokesperson said Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case were aware in advance. Mr Johnson was under for a ‘relatively brief time’. He said: ‘Operationally, my understanding is there’s a 24-hour period from when the operation takes place… under which sort of significant decisions would be deferred to probably in the first instance the Deputy Prime Minister. ‘Now we’re not anticipating any of that being required currently, but we do have that capability.’ The NHS operation had been scheduled ‘for a while’. It has not been revealed at which hospital the procedure took place. Mr Johnson’s problem with his sinuses is not thought to be linked to him testing positive for Covid in 2020. The Conservative leader at the weekend returned from his second secret trip to Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Downing Street has been accused of announcing phone calls between the PM and President Volodymyr Zelensky to distract from scandals at crisis-hit Number 10. And Mr Johnson was branded a ‘chicken Kyiv’ for missing a ‘red wall’ rally in Doncaster on Friday – as two crunch by-elections loom. The PM celebrated his 58th birthday yesterday.
