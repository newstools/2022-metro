A pensioner has denied causing the death of a baby boy by careless driving. Louis Thorold’s parents were ‘heartbroken’ when their ‘joyful’ five-month-old died on the afternoon of January 22 last year. Shelagh Robertson, 74, is accused of not paying proper care and attention as she drove in Waterbeach, Cambridgeshire. The defendant, from Waterbeach, is said to have been driving a Mazda 2 car on the A10 at the junction with Car Dyke Road. The little boy’s mum Rachael Thorold also suffered serious injuries as she pushed her son in a pram. Mrs Thorold and Louis’ father Chris were in court as Robertson pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to the single charge of causing the infant’s death by careless driving. The white-haired OAP, who wore a black cardigan and blue trousers, only spoke to confirm her name and plea. She was granted unconditional bail, with a trial scheduled for August 8 at Cambridge Crown Court. Chris previously paid tribute to his son, saying ‘we will love you always, our little Louis’. ‘You were only with us for a short time, but you made us the happiest people in the world’, he said. ‘I cannot describe how heartbroken we are that you are gone. ‘You are such a happy little boy and your joyful smile and laughter will never leave us. ‘You will always be in our hearts and do not worry, I am taking care of all our animals. ‘We love you so much and we know you will now be safe with Granny, Grandad and Great Grandpa in Heaven. ‘Take care my little Lou, sweet dreams.’ MORE : Drunk mum beat up pregnant friend and assaulted two children at kids’ party Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
