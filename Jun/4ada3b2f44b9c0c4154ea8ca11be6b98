A police officer fatally shot a 13-year-old boy who allegedly was trying to flee in a stolen vehicle when he rammed into a patrol car on Friday. Police in San Antonio, Texas were responding to a call on the city’s west side about a shooting around 1.30am Friday when the accident occurred. While responding to reports of a shooting, a red vehicle backed up into the patrol vehicle before attempting to flee, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus said, according to KSAT. The driver of the car, a 13-year-old boy, apparently tried to flee the scene because the vehicle was reported stolen. As the young driver sped up, he reversed the vehicle and rammed into the cop car, police said. Instead of stopping the stolen vehicle, it sped up and crashed, prompting officers to try and stop the driver from taking off. An officer then opened fire on the car, shooting the unidentified 13-year-old in the stomach. The teen was treated on the scene by emergency medical service professionals and taken to an area hospital, where he later died. Two other teens were inside the car at the time of the accident, but they were not injured, police said. None of the teens involved have been identified by police. It’s unclear whether the two passengers would face any charges. The officer who fatally shot the young boy also has not been identified. The officer has since been placed on administrative leave.
