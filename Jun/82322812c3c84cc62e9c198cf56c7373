Holidaymakers stranded at Norwich airport for two days have finally made it to Majorca after a 43-hour delay. Some of the frustrated passengers who persisted with their travels had to sleep in their cars as they waited for updates. The TUI flight to Palma was scheduled to fly at 7.20pm on Friday but did not take off until 1.55pm on Sunday. Pensioner Terry Mack said he has never been treated so badly, adding: ‘I am 75 and I have travelled all over the world since I was 16. ‘But never in almost 60 years have I ever known people to be treated so appallingly.’ A TUI spokesman said: ‘We would like to apologise to customers travelling on LAV5480 from Norwich to Palma which was unfortunately delayed due to a technical issue with the aircraft. ‘We have refunded impacted customers for two nights of their holiday, along with providing overnight accommodation, meals and refreshments as needed. ‘Customers will also be entitled to EU 261 compensation from the airline and details of how to claim have also been given. ‘We do understand that last-minute delays are incredibly disappointing and we would like to reassure customers that we do everything we can to get them away on their holidays as planned. ‘We’d like to apologise again for the inconvenience passengers travelling to Palma are experiencing and we thank them for their understanding.’ But passengers denied TUI had kept them updated regularly, and some claimed they had not been offered help with accommodation. Holiday plans have been plagued for weeks because of ongoing staffing chaos at airports across Britain. Several big operators have grounded flights including Tui, British Airways, and easyJet.
