An angry dad has been fined after he seriously lost the plot and punched a manager when he was caught short while using toilets at KFC. Kenneth Scott, 51, went to the toilet while his wife and son stood in line, but realised there was no loo roll. His son went to the bathroom on the evening of April 23 to ask what he wanted to eat and Scott asked for toilet paper. Prosecutor Jason Stark said Scott went to the counter to complain but says he was left standing there for 20 minutes before anyone spoke to him. His lawyer Kevin Brady said: ‘There was no lock on the door and no soap in the dispenser. His wife also stated there was no toilet paper in the female toilets.’ The manager said he thought the toilets were in a satisfactory condition. Mr Stark said: ‘This angered the accused and he grabbed the manager by the neck and punched him on the back of the head.’ He added: ‘When he showed the manager that there was no soap in the dispenser, he was told [by the manager] “If you are smart enough, you’ll figure it out”. ‘He thought he was treated absolutely disgracefully and it was a momentary lapse. Scott was arrested and has now had to pay £400 in compensation to his victim and a £320 fine. Sheriff Lindsey Kooner told him at Paisley Sheriff Court: ‘Make sure this comes out of your pocket and not the family’s funds.’ She added: ‘It’s really inexplicable how someone of your previous good character and good work ethic would behave in the manner that you did and it’s completely unacceptable.’
