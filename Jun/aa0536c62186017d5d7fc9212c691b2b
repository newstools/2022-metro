A man has been charged with murder after a ‘hero’ teenage boy was stabbed to death. Suleman Altaf, 44, of no fixed address, is alleged to have killed Jakub Szymanski in Greater Manchester. The 15-year-old’s mother was also injured in the June 9 attack, which detectives described at the time as ‘ferocious’. The teenager’s family paid tribute to Jakub in a statement, who was known as ‘Kuba’ to those who knew him. It read: ‘He was always a popular child, making friends wherever he went due to his friendly and chatty nature. ‘He always spoke his mind, he was mischievous, funny and a cheeky boy. He loved his Xbox and football, supporting Manchester City. ‘He was like every other teenage boy and was helpful to so many people, even those he just met. To our family, he’s our hero.’ The schoolboy died in hospital from his injuries about an hour after emergency services were called to an address in the Miles Platting area of Manchester. His mother, Katarzyna Bastek, was treated for serious stab wounds at the property in Bednal Avenue but survived. She is said to be in a stable condition in hospital and receiving support after learning of the death of her son. In a statement, Greater Manchester Police said: ‘Suleman Altaf, 44, of no fixed address, has been charged with murder, attempted murder and having a bladed article in a public place. ‘He has been remanded in custody ahead of a hearing at Manchester and Salford Magistrates’ Court today. ‘The charges relate to the fatal stabbing of 15-year-old Jakub Szymanski and the stabbing of his mother at a property in the Miles Platting area on Thursday.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
