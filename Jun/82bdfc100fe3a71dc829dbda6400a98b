A 34-year-old man has been charged in the deaths of six people who were found dead in January. Investigators say they found a selfie taken by Travis Lamar Birkley, taken in his basement where the bodies were found. He was charged with six counts of felony murder in the deaths of six people who were found with gunshot wounds on January 23 in a duplex in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Investigators linked Birkley to the killings using cellphone data that included a selfie he took that appeared to show the basement of the home where the bodies were found several hours after the killings. Three of the bodies were found in that basement, and investigators believe they were killed three days before they were discovered. In the photos, Birkley appeared to be wearing an expensive pair of glasses that belonged to one of his victims, according to WDJT-TV. Birkley had admitted to police that he and his cousin had killed the six people during a botched drug robbery, according to WDJT. Shell casings found at the scene of the crime reportedly came from two different guns. His cousin has not been identified and no additional arrests have been made in connection to the case. Authorities previously identified the six victims as Michelle Williams, 49; Donta Williams, 44; Donald Smith, 43; Charles Hardy, 42; Javoni Liddell, 31; and Caleb Jordan, 23. Michelle Williams. Three of the victims lived at the home where the bodies were found. Bail for Birkley was set at $1million. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
