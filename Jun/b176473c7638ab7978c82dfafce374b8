A Morrisons shopper found nearly £4,000 cash in one of the supermarket’s car parks – but instead of quietly pocketing the bundle of notes, she handed it in. The customer, Annie, made the incredible discovery at the Swadlincote store in South Derbyshire. She initially thought nothing of the haul and ran her trolley straight over it. But she quickly doubled back when it ‘popped’ and a pile of notes spilled out. Annie said: ‘When I saw the envelope on the floor, I thought it was a balloon and I pushed my shopping trolley over it to pop it. The envelope popped and loads of money fell out. ‘I took the money home and could not rest worrying about the person who had lost it. I only did the right thing.’ The envelope contained £3,800 which has now made its way back to its rightful owner. They repaid the kindness by giving some back to Annie as a thank you. The local police force were also touched by Annie’s honesty and paid her a visit on Monday in a marked police car with the blue lights flashing and sirens sounding. Officers from the Mercia Safer Neighbourhood Team gave her a letter of thanks from Derbyshire Constabulary, along with a bunch of flowers and some chocolates. Sergeant Nizzer and officer Bob said: ‘Words cannot describe Annie. She is a truly amazing lady who deserves the thanks and praise of the whole community. Well done.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
