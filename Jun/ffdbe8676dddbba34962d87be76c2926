Great British Bake Off winner Peter Sawkins has been praised by co-stars and fans after sharing a video of himself holding hands with a mystery man during Pride month. The baker, who stormed the Channel 4 competition in 2020 and beat Dave Friday and Laura Adlington in the grand finale, was immediately met with support after posting the clip on social media. In the post, Peter is seen living his best life while holidaying in Marrakech, Morocco. At the end of the footage, which is set to the song I Found You by Stephen Sanchez, he holds hands with a mystery man, who is believed to be his partner, as they walk through the medina. Captioning the post, Peter wrote: ‘Wanderlust | wun•der•lust (n.) a strong desire for or impulse to wonder or travel the world. 🌷💐🌹🌸 ‘Collect memories not things. You only live once, and when you do it right, once it enough. Live for the moments you can’t put into words. If not now, when?’ Peter was quickly flooded with messages of support with fellow Bake Off finalist Laura writing: ‘Love this and love you!’ Bake Off winner Rahul Mandal added: ‘Love this!’ One fan said: ‘Just beautiful Peter ❤️🌈love is love and this is such a strong move.’ Another penned: ‘Thank you for living your authentic life – you are an inspiration to so many already, just for being you, and we’re so very lucky that you choose to share it with the world!’ Peter was crowned Bake Off’s youngest ever winner in 2020 after winning the show aged 20. Speaking to BBC radio’s Good Morning Scotland at the time, he said: ‘It’s an absolute dream. I was really pleased with how I managed to step through all the challenges.’ Peter was a student at the time of the competition and was completing a degree in accounting and finance. ‘I feel in a really privileged position because of course there will be some opportunities that arise from this, and it would be amazing to try and explore them, but at the same time I am going to keep on going with my degree, so I’m in a nice position.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted Peter’s reps for comment.
