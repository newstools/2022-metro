Looking to spice things up in the bedroom? If the answer is yes, than give the elephant position a try. While it sounds scary, in actuality it is one of the easier moves in the Kama Sutra book. And the big plus is that it’s equally pleasurable for both partners. Made to hit super sensitive spots, it’s also ideal on days when you don’t have the time or energy for complicated positions. Otherwise known as the ‘elephant posture,’ it’s inspired by the mating of elephants. Animalistic and primitive, it puts the person on top in charge of pleasure. To engage in the elephant position, the receiving partner lays on their front while keeping the thighs close together, rather than apart. This is best done on a bed or sofa, or anywhere you’ll both be comfortable. The penetrating partner then enters from behind, supporting their weight on the arms while straddling their partner. The person on the bottom can then lift their upper torso off the bed to get closer to the penetrating partner, allowing for kissing and intimate dirty talk. For deeper penetration and sensations, the higher the person on the bottom tilts their body, the more intense the feeling. And for an even better orgasm, the receiving partner can cross their ankles and squeeze their muscles. The penetrating partner will be able to feel the contractions, which will heighten the sensation of closeness. Meanwhile, if you are on the bottom, your hands are free, meaning you have the opportunity to pleasure yourself throughout. All in all, this makes it a position that is sure to satisfy.
