This unique property might look normal enough on the outside, but there have been some pretty interesting alterations made inside. The home, located in the desert with views of South Mountain in Phoenix, Arizona, definitely has a lot of kerb appeal. But the facade contains an impressive nine-hole putting green. It sits on the ground floor complete with white flags and a little ramp, to add an extra challenge. Clearly, the owner was a big golf fan, with the home also located overlooking the 10th fairway of the local Grand Resort – the perfect spot to enjoy a few outdoor rounds. Priced at $1,022,900 (approximately £813,600) and marketed by Benjamin Funke of Homesmart, it will surely leave many green with envy when it sells. The rest of the property is on the normal side of things, but definitely leans towards luxury thanks to features such as a freshly resurfaced swimming pool and panoramic views of the neighbouring mountain and resort. ‘Prior to listing the property for sale, my client and I discussed whether or not the indoor putting green should be reverted back to a traditional living space,’ property agent Benjamin Funke told NeedToKnow.online. ‘Instead, we decided to showcase the whimsical essence of living in a spacious golf course property in the foothills of South Mountain, the nation’s largest city park. ‘This home quite literally brings the outdoors inside with a sloped 9-hole putting green and just shy of 100 exterior windows. ‘If you enjoy blue skies, green spaces, and sprawling mountain ranges, this Arizona home is for you. There is nothing quite like it.’ Do you have a story to share?
