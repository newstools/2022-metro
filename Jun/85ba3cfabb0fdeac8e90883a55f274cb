Zara Tindall pulled off a very cheeky trick on Prince George during the Platinum Party at the Palace. As the young royal watched the stars perform on stage, Princess Anne’s daughter slowly leaned forward and poked him in the ear with the Union Jack flag. Kate Middleton, 40, giggled away while Princess Charlotte, 7, marveled at the stunt. However, George did not look amused as the flag touched his ear. But he then saw the funny side and retaliated against Zara afterwards. Zara is in fact Prince George’s godmother so they hold a special bond with one another. The royals enjoyed a star-studded lineup last night, as revellers partied well into the evening. Artists from across the world and the UK came together to celebrate Her Majesty’s 70-year reign. The likes of Diana Ross, Rod Stewart, Craig David, Sir Elton John, Alicia Keys and George Ezra were just some of the massive names on the bill. While many of the royals got their dancing shoes on, the Queen watched at home in Windsor Castle. But this did not stop her getting in the action – as appeared in video with Britain’s favourite bear, Paddington. The Platinum Jubilee celebrations will be rounded off with a special pageant today.
