Doctors were left baffled after finding hundreds of coins, nails, batteries and shards of glass inside a man’s stomach. Burhan Demir – from Ipekyolu, Turkey – took his younger brother to hospital after he complained about abdominal pain. But when doctors performed an endoscopy with ultrasound and X-ray scans they were amazed to discover 233 items in the 35-year-old’s stomach. These included one-lira coins, batteries, magnets, nails, pieces of glass, stones and screws. Surgeons later removed the items from the patient, named only as Z. One surgeon – named only as Dr Binici – said: ‘During the surgery, we saw that one or two of the nails had passed through the stomach wall. ‘We saw that there were two metal pieces and two stones of different sizes in the large intestine. ‘We found that there were batteries, magnets, nails, coins, pieces of glass and screws. We cleaned his stomach completely. ‘It is not a situation we see in adults, it is mostly in childhood and unconsciously swallowed foreign bodies. ‘It can be seen in psychiatric patients, prisoners or abuse cases in the adult age group.’ Burhan told local media: ‘He was referred to this hospital. After the checks performed here, he was operated on and these objects were removed from his stomach.’ It is not clear when the operation took place, but the story was reported in local media on June 15. Burhan added: ‘I thank the doctors for their attention and support.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
