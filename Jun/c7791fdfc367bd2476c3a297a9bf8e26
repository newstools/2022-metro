Arsenal have opened talks to sign Real Madrid midfielder Marco Asensio, according to reports. The 26-year-old has just one year left on his contract with the Champions League holders and is yet to reach a new agreement. Asensio has won three La Liga titles and three Champions League trophies during his time in Madrid but the winger started just 21 games across both competitions last season. Manchester United, Tottenham and AC Milan have all been linked with a move for the Spain international this summer. But according to the Sunday Mirror, Arsenal have also entered the race to sign Asensio and have held discussions with the midfielder’s representative. The report claims that Asensio is not put off by Arsenal’s lack of Champions League football and is demanding assurances from Madrid over his playing time before signing a new deal. Speaking earlier this month Asensio, who was an unused substitute in the Champions League final, admitted he could leave Madrid this summer. ‘I have one more year in my contract yet here we are talking about me leaving Real Madrid,’ Asensio said. ‘This is an important moment for me, I will not deny it. ‘I am more mature and not only on the field, this is an important moment and I will have to make important decisions. ‘Me and my family know that I have to keep growing and moving forward. I want to achieve important things in football and they help me do that.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
