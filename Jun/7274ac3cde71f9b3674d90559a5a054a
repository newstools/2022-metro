Simon Cowell and Lauren Silverman are reportedly days away from tying the knot after years of dating. The Britain’s Got Talent star, 63, and socialite Lauren, 44, have had a rollercoaster of a relationship, which settled down when they welcomed their first and only child together, Eric. Now eight years old, Eric is set to watch his parents get married after music mogul Simon got down on one knee and asked Lauren to marry him on Christmas Day last year. Simon proposed on the island country of Barbados, 13 years after they met at  the same place – while Lauren was still married to Simon’s then-close friend, Andrew Silverman. While no wedding plans have been confirmed, Simon’s BGT co-star David Walliams hinted that, when it does happen, he expects it to be ‘a big wedding’. So, as we wait to see if there’ll be wedding bells for Simon and Lauren this month, here’s a look back at how they got here. Got a story?
