*Please find below a correspondence from Metro.co.uk’s independent ethics adviser As you know, since taking up the post of independent ethics adviser to Metro.co.uk, I have long argued against expecting people to read the news on a weekend. This week, I was asked to give my opinion on issuing a Saturday news round-up despite the fact public interest is likely to be significantly reduced by the warm weather. After frank discussions, you decided to discount my counsel and press ahead with the ICYMI pre-pub digest, reasoning that ‘if we’ve got to write this s**t, those b******s have got to read it’. You conceded that ‘you know it’s absolutely f*****g roasting’ but restated your position that ‘they can like it or f*****g lump it’ before launching an empty bottle of Hooch in my direction. I had hoped we could repair our strained working relationship during a planned meeting this morning. You did not attend because you ‘couldn’t be f****d’. Further comments RE: my ‘ugly f****g face’ were made. As I have expressed in no uncertain terms in private, I feel this week’s developments make my position untenable. I therefore write to tender my immediate resignation. To lose one ethics adviser might be bad luck – but to lose two, that starts to look like a bit of a pattern. Lord Geidt, the man employed by the government to advise on whether the actions of ministers abide by rules, has finally had enough. He resigned this week, saying he had been put in an ‘odious’ position, alluding to discussions about a planned government announcement which may knowingly breach the ministerial code (reportedly a move to go against World Trade Organisation rules in order to support the steel industry). Lord Geidt is the second person to quit the job in protest under Boris Jonnson, a role he has transformed from a cushy Whitehall number into Her Majesty’s Independent Adviser On Pushing A Boulder Up A Mountain. His decision to quit took Number 10 by surprise – after all, if he was willing to swallow partygate, surely he could get past this one – but off he went to the big private member’s club in the sky. Advising the prime minister on ethics must be as thankless a task as advising a dog not to hump the furniture (their eyes say they’re sorry but you know it won’t be their last dalliance) so Number 10 has signalled it could scrap the role altogether and spare some other poor sod the indignity. The scene should have been set for the Labour leader to clamber onto his high horse and lay the moral indignation on thick – but alas, no. Two days earlier, the parliamentary sleaze watchdog confirmed it was investigating Sir Keir for not properly registering income, reportedly royalties from a book and hospitality tickets to watch Arsenal FC at various grounds around London. Guns spiked. While that was all playing out, the Bank of England was getting on with putting interest rates up and warning that inflation will hit 11%. While the PM fights to get out of his moral maze, the cost of living crisis deepens. TL;DR: Boris finally snuffs out his Geidt-ing light. The government got a taste of what it’s like to try and book a holiday at the moment when a flight it was really, really looking forward to was cancelled at the last minute. Ministers always knew their plans to send migrants to Rwanda would attract court challenges but even they must have been shocked by the Total Wipeout-style assault course of legal problems they ran headlong into. Despite UK courts waving away appeals to stop the flight altogether, lawyers representing people holding a one-way ticket to central Africa had more success. On the eve of the first flight, a planned passenger list of around 130 people had been whittled down to just seven but the Home Office was pressing ahead with plans to charter the plane anyway – at a cost of around £500,000 to the taxpayer. With hours to go and more challenges being filed, the government – which, lest we forget, is super-duper committed to reducing carbon emissions – was poised to send an empty or near-empty airliner 4,000 miles just to prove a point. The European Court of Human Rights put an end to the unedifying charade by ruling in favour of one of the passengers, a move which revived other cases previously dismissed by UK judges and grounded the flight. The policy is far from dead and more court cases will follow but, for now, the government’s Rwanda policy looks about as orderly as the customer complaint queue at an EasyJet check-in desk. TL;DR: The Rwanda plan continues to go as well as everybody warned it would. Perhaps emboldened by the box office success of the Top Gun reboot, Prince Andrew attempted to stage a comeback this week. After all, just like Tom Cruise, the Duke of York made his name in the 1980s and has some complicated public image problems to deal with. The reboot, however, proved to be mission impossible. (ED: You do not need to write to us about how bad that joke is, we already know.) Reports emerged over the weekend that Andrew intended to show up at the Order of the Garter ceremony at Windsor Castle on Monday, which saw honours handed out to a select group which included Sir Tony Blair. Ordinarily, as a senior member of the order, he would have been expected to be front and centre – but that’s obviously tricky with the whole paying millions of pounds to a woman he denies raping business. He is reportedly keen to return to some frontline duties and this was the first real test of The Firm’s position on letting him back into the fold (they were spared that at the Platinum Jubilee by a spectacularly convenient bout of Covid-19). In the end, Andrew was nowhere to be seen, although he was permitted to attend the non-public parts of the ceremony far from the watching crowds and cameras. There have been reports both Prince Charles and Prince William had personally appealed to the Queen to prevent him from attending. Is any of that true? God knows. It’s impossible to separate royal rumour and tittle tattle from what is briefed by ‘friends and allies’ who are genuinely in the know – and harder still to discern whether the passing of information to a select cohort of reporters has been authorised higher up the chain. All we know for sure is that Andrew was seemingly kept well away from the public – but you wouldn’t bet against him trying to stage another revival in the near future. TL;DR: Not everything needs a reboot. If you live in the North or Scotland, you’ve been enjoying some pleasant weather this week. For those further south, you may well be reading this from the pool of sweat you awoke in after another burning night sleeping in a furnace. Records for the hottest temperature of the year so far have only managed to stand for 24 hours, toppled over by the following day’s soaring heat. The mercury blasted past 30 degrees Celsius in some parts of the country on Friday, the third day in a row a new benchmark was set on the Scorchometer. Photographers the length and breadth of the country have enjoyed a payday by long-lensing burnt backs bared in all their crimson glory and, in a move so English it feels like a joke, Ascot Racecourse has is allowing guests to take off their ties for the first time in its history. Of course, there are concerns that the dramatic fluctuations in temperatures are a symptom of the climate crisis which is gripping our planet and…HOLD THAT THOUGHT, I CAN HEAR THE ICE CREAM MAN. TL;DR: Yes, sir, I would like an extra flake. A new piece of art in a West Yorkshire park has got locals talking owing to its putative resemblance to a you know what. The 20ft phallic installation has attracted admirers, defenders and ridicule in equal measure since it was erected. Metro.co.uk’s very own Sian Elvin took up the pen of truth to tell this very important story for all of us, a fearless piece of journalism into which she poured blood, sweat and tears. Her report grabbed the attention of Radio 1 host Greg James, who giggled through a dramatic reading of Sian’s story on air. He even suggested the ‘privates investigator’ or ‘corresdongdent’ who wrote the story should be given the afternoon off by her boss. At time of writing, Sian still hasn’t been granted a flyer by the bigwigs at Metro.co.uk – we’ll let you be the judge as to whether she deserves a free afternoon below.
