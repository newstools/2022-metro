One UK ticket-holder has won almost £55 million with the EuroMillions jackpot. The winner scooped a total of £54,957,242.50 with five main numbers and two lucky star numbers. Camelot’s Andy Carter, senior winners’ advisor at the National Lottery, said: ‘What a brilliant night for one UK ticket-holder who has scooped the amazing £54 million EuroMillions jackpot! ‘Players are urged to check their tickets and to give us a call if they think they are tonight’s lucky winner.’ It comes after married couple Joe and Jess Thwaite became Britain’s biggest ever EuroMillions winners after scooping £184,262,899 with a lucky dip ticket on May 10. But the pair from Gloucester are ‘down to Earth people’ and haven’t let all of that money go to their heads. They could be out living the high life, and we wouldn’t blame them, but this week it emerged their first big purchase since winning was a £38,000 Volvo V60. Players generate £30million every week for the charities and good causes the National Lottery contributes to. More than £1.2billion has been distributed to date across the UK to help tackle the impact of coronavirus. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
