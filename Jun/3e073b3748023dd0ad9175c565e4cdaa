Meghan Markle has been pictured for the first time at the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations. She was seen smiling with the Queen’s great-grandchildren Savannah Phillips and Mia Tindall during the Trooping the Colour ceremony. Dressed in a wide-brimmed dark blue and white hat, the Duchess of Sussex beamed as she watched the ceremony from a private room at the Major General’s Office overlooking the Horseguards Parade. She was pictured playfully holding a finger to her lips and blowing a kiss to Savannah, as well as chatting to the Duke of Kent with her husband Prince Harry. Their two children Archie and Lilibet, aged three and almost one, have not yet been seen, with many eagerly awaiting a glimpse of them at the celebrations. The family arrived in the UK yesterday after flying in from LAX. It is their first time returning since they moved to North America last year, and will let baby Lilibet meet her family here for the first time – ready for her first birthday, which is on Saturday. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex joined a host of royals including the Duchess of Cambridge and Duchess of Cornwall in the Duke of Wellington’s former office the parade ground. Royals playing a key role in the celebrations, including the Queen herself, gathered on the Buckingham Palace balcony for a flypast by the Red Arrows to celebrate the monarch’s 70 years on the throne. The Queen was seen wearing sunglasses and carrying a walking stick. Charles, the Prince of Wales, stood on his mother’s right-hand side and the pair could be seen chatting and smiling ahead of the flypast. The Queen, age 96, smiled throughout the flypast and waved at the crowds before going back into the palace. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
