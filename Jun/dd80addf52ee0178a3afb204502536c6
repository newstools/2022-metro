Kendall Jenner is no stranger to a nude photoshoot and recently decided to bare all in a cheeky snap. The American model, 26, is thought to have recently split from her boyfriend Devin Booker after two years of dating, but the split doesn’t seem to be dulling her shine. Kendall has previously spoken about feeling empowered by showing off some skin, like when she walked in a Marc Jacobs fashion show braless and later said she just ‘loves’ her boobs being out and she gets ‘really excited’ by it. Making the most of the glorious weather at home, the reality star did a spot of sunbathing and seemingly decided the best way to avoid tan lines is ti just avoid clothing altogether. Kendall shared the nude pic on her Instagram for 245million followers to enjoy, showing her lying on her stomach on a sun lounger while scrolling on her phone, naked bum in the air. She also posted several other pics in the carousel, including a stunning video of a sunset from the car and a plate of sushi. The post is fast approaching eight million likes, and Kendall’s fans took to the comments to hype her up. ‘Queen’, one fan wrote, while another commented: ‘She said let hot girl summer commence 😂’. Others were also living for ‘single Kendall’ following her supposed split from the basketball star, commenting: ‘Love me some breakup posts’ and, ‘Single Kendall is a big mood’. Kendall and Devin were first romantically linked in 2020 but are said to have called time on their relationship after discussions about the future. One source said: ‘Kendall feels like they’re on different paths.’ Another told ET that the pair ‘have had discussions about their future but they are not on the same page.’ One source told E! that they had a lovely time together during Kourtney Kardashian’s wedding but ‘once they got back, they started to feel like they weren’t aligned and realised they have very different lifestyles.’ However, the insider added: ‘They both hope to make it work, but as of now, they are split.’ The couple have kept their dating life rather private over the last two years, only sharing a couple of Insta snaps together here and there. Kendall did frequently attend her beau’s basketball games though to cheer him on and they were often spotted on dinner dates. Speaking with Jimmy Fallon in a rare comment about her relationship, Kendall did say: ‘I watch every game unless I have—last night I had a dinner but all my friends and family know that I like sit with my phone wherever I am.’ ‘I’ve always been a fan of basketball since basically with Khloé [Kardashian, I remember we used to go to all the Lakers games when I was really young so I’ve been a huge fan of the NBA for a really long time.’ She also told the talk show host of Devin’s sweet bond with her niece Stormi: ‘They have an amazing relationship. ‘She has the biggest crush on him, and I’m jealous sometimes. I’m like, “Stop — can you guys not?”‘ Got a story?
