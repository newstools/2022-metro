Erik ten Hag has convinced Frenkie de Jong to leave Barcelona for Manchester United, although the clubs still need to come to an agreement over a fee. Ten Hag worked with De Jong at Ajax and wants to welcome the Netherlands international to Old Trafford following his appointment as United manager. De Jong made 89 appearances for Ajax and helped Ten Hag’s side win the Eredivisie title in 2019 and reach the semi-finals of the Champions League before joining Barcelona in a deal worth £65m. The midfielder has continued to impress at the Nou Camp, amassing 140 appearances over the last three seasons and establishing himself as a key member of the first-team squad. Ten Hag wants to make De Jong his first United signing as he looks to rebuild his squad following the departures of several players, including Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Nemanja Matic. According to the Daily Mirror, Ten Hag has persuaded De Jong to join the Premier League giants, although United still face a challenge to agree a deal with Barcelona. On Friday, reports claimed Barcelona had rejected United’s opening bid for De Jong – which was believed to be worth £60m – and were holding out for a package worth around £80m. Barcelona were emboldened by De Jong’s insistence that he wanted to stay but his stance has changed following a series of talks with Ten Hag. The Mirror say De Jong has had a change of heart after speaking to Ten Hag about his plan to turn Manchester United into title contenders and being reminded of the success they shared at Ajax. After landing De Jong, Ten Hag will turn his attentions to signing a new forward and defender, having missed out on a deal for Liverpool-bound Darwin Nunez. Ten Hag identified Benfica striker Nunez as a top target for this summer’s transfer window but Liverpool are set to welcome the Uruguayan to Anfield in a deal worth around £85m.
