Two preschool teachers were arrested on child cruelty charges after parents reported seeing them abusing three-year-old children on a live video feed from the classroom. Horrified parents tuning in to check on their kids said they saw the staff members standing on one child’s hand as well as kneeing another in the back and pushing their head backwards. The alleged incident is said to have taken place at the Parker-Chase preschool in Roswell, Georgia, last week. Brant Duncan and Gloria Barghi had rushed to the school demanding the teachers be removed after seeing the footage. They also called police along with one of the alleged victim’s parents. Zeina Alostwani, 40, and Soriana Briceno, 19, were arrested after officers watched the clip. The mother of one of the children told WSBTV: ‘It was a matter of seconds. I knew what we had seen was deliberate, and my stomach was just in my throat at that point.’ Mr Duncan said: ‘It doesn’t matter whose child it is. It’s a child. They’re helpless. They’re defenceless.’ Numerous other complainants have come forward with allegations since the arrests and a wider investigation is now underway. A Roswell Police spokesperson told WSBTV they have ‘several weeks of video to go back and review to make sure there are no other instances of this kind of behaviour’. School officials were quoted as saying: ‘While we are extremely grateful that the children are well, we take this matter seriously, and our investigation is ongoing. ‘We expect our staff to adhere to the highest standards of care, and any failure to do so will not be tolerated.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
