Great British Bake Off winner Peter Sawkins has clarified a video he shared of him holding hands with a mystery man that went viral. The 21-year-old baker, who won the 2020 series of the Channel 4 series, was praised for sharing a video of himself walking alongside another man while on holiday in Morocco over the weekend, with the two holding hands. Many of Peter’s followers interpreted the footage to be him ‘coming out’ but the TV star has said this isn’t the case. In an update in his Instagram stories, Peter explained: ‘Clarification of a recent reel. I am trying to address this with sensitivity and kindness. ‘I recently posted a reel from my holiday. #Some news sites and comments celebrated this as me coming out, and I can appreciate how this has happened.’ He then stated: ‘However, this is not the case. I do not identify as LGBTQ+. ‘I fully support the LGBTQ+ community and will try to be an ally as best as I can. Representation within the LGBTQ+ community across society is incredibly important.’ ‘This is why I felt the need to clarify in this story. Written with love, Peter,’ he concluded. The clip, which Peter shared on Sunday, is soundtracked to the song I Found You by Stephen Sanchez, and shows Peter holding hands with a mystery man as they walked through the medina. Captioning the post, Peter wrote: ‘Wanderlust | wun•der•lust (n.) a strong desire for or impulse to wonder or travel the world. 🌷💐🌹🌸 ‘Collect memories not things. You only live once, and when you do it right, once it enough. Live for the moments you can’t put into words. If not now, when?’ Peter was quickly flooded with messages of support with fellow Bake Off finalist Laura Adlington writing: ‘Love this and love you!’ Bake Off winner Rahul Mandal added: ‘Love this!’ Peter shot to fame after being crowned Bake Off’s youngest ever winner in 2020 after winning the show aged 20. He was a student at the time of the competition and was completing a degree in accounting and finance. Got a story?
