Some of us are lucky enough to still be working remotely. With that comes freedom – your office could be anywhere in the world. As many Brits in this position are taking advantage of the opportunity to live abroad and travel, Airbnb have researched the top locations to explore while still working. The nomad lifestyle is on the rise, as Google search data shows ‘move abroad’ as a search term rose by 1,000% in April. About one in five guests on Airbnb used the site to work remotely while travelling in 2021 – and the trend is growing this year too. In the UK, there has also been a third in growth in long term Airbnb stays, suggesting more people are embracing working from anywhere. According to their booking data, these are the top locations to consider. Data from Indeed also showed more people are searching for remote jobs, with one of the key benefits being flexibility on location. Pawel Adrjan, head of EMEA research at Indeed, said: ‘Remote working and expectations around greater flexibility were on the rise before the pandemic but nearly two years of lockdown living and working from home orders have turned remote work into a mainstream and viable option for entire workforces in certain sectors of the economy. ‘Far from seeing the trend reverse as lockdown restrictions eased, our research shows that searches for remote work have remained high throughout the year and have just hit an all-time high, suggesting that many jobseekers want to continue working remotely.’ Is it time to get on a plane?
