A temporary ban on parties in Airbnb homes across the UK has now been made permanent. First introduced during the Covid pandemic, the company says it has seen a sharp drop in reports of unauthorised gatherings at host properties. The San Francisco-based tech company said it saw a 44% year-after-year drop in the rate of party reports since implementing the policy in August 2020. The policy was first put in place to try and halt the spread of Covid. Now it’s become permanent. ‘This is an issue where I don’t know if I’d say there’s a finish line,’ said Ben Breit, a spokesperson for the company. Airbnb also said it will also remove its 16-person limit, allowing larger homes listed on the platform to be booked to full occupancy. In 2019, Airbnb began imposing much stricter limits, starting with a global ban on so-called ‘party houses’ or listings that create persistent neighborhood nuisance. Airbnb has also updated its policies considering the pandemic, removing both the ‘event friendly’ search filter and ‘parties and events allowed’ house rules. More than 6,600 guests and some hosts were suspended in 2021 for attempting to violate the party ban, the company said. A spokesman said: ‘At Airbnb, we believe the neighbourhoods and communities in which we operate are as important as the Hosts and guests who use our service. ‘We know that the overwhelming majority of our Hosts share their homes responsibly, just as the overwhelming majority of guests are responsible and treat their Airbnb listings and neighbourhoods as if they were their own.’ MORE : Airbnb will pay you £80,000 to design and build an absolutely wild home for guests MORE : Woman stays in shop window for £1,000 a night after AirBnb prank escalates
