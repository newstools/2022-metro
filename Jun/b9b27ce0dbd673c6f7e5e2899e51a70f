Christian Eriksen is set to reject a move to Manchester United as he wants to stay in London, opening the door to a sensational return to Tottenham. New Red Devils manager Erik ten Hag is keen to bolster his midfield options this summer and has identified Eriksen as a top target. Earlier this month, Manchester United confirmed the departure of 11 first-team players, including midfielders Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic and Juan Mata. United are in talks with Barcelona over a deal for Netherlands international Frenkie de Jong but, given the number of players who have left Old Trafford this month, Ten Hag could bring two midfielders to the club this summer. It was reported last week that Manchester United had made a contract offer to Eriksen, who thrived at Premier League side Brentford last season. The 30-year-old, who suffered a cardiac arrest at Euro 2020, is available to sign on a free transfer as his contract with Brentford expires on June 30. But it appears that United will miss out on a deal for Eriksen as The Athletic say the Denmark international wants to stay in London. That would made Eriksen’s current club Brentford and former side Tottenham the favourites to secure his services on a permanent deal. More to follow… For more stories like this, check our sport page.
