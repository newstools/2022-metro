Anthony Joshua has defended his decision to threaten university students who heckled him, and says he would do the same again. The former world heavyweight champion told Loughborough University students he would ‘crack their glass jaws’ last month after they taunted him with claims he was afraid to fight Tyson Fury. Joshua, who will try to win back the belts he lost to Oleksandr Usyk in an August rematch, said: ‘The reason I had to address them is I can’t let them be too comfortable being comfortable calling me names from a window. I told them, “I’m not here to play games. You’re crossing the wrong person”. ‘I feel sorry for any student that ain’t got a backbone and starts shouting s**t through a window and that person feels like they can’t ever come around this area again if they’re quite timid. ‘I had to let them know, “If you see me again, I will break your jaw if you think you can shout s**t at me”.’ Meanwhile, Joshua believes his corner did not put him in the full picture during his defeat on points to the Ukrainian last September. Former cruiserweight Usyk took a unanimous decision at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to become WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO world heavyweight king. But 32-year-old Joshua, who has since replaced Robert McCracken with American Robert Garcia as his new head trainer, felt he did not have full information from his corner on how the clash was unravelling. ‘I thought throughout I was well in the fight,’ added the Watford man, who is aiming to become a three-time global champ. ‘It did seem there was no communication as to where I was at – “you’re losing this fight, you’re down by two rounds”.’ MORE : Deontay Wilder makes his prediction for Oleksandr Usyk vs Anthony Joshua rematch MORE : Oleksandr Usyk explains why he won’t be using war in Ukraine to inspire him to victory over Anthony Joshua For more stories like this, check our sport page.
