Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel has urged the club to replace Romelu Lukaku with Robert Lewandowski this summer. Lukaku is eager to return to Inter Milan after one season back at Stamford Bridge where he scored just eight goals in 26 Premier League appearances. Talks between Chelsea’s new co-owner Todd Boehly and Inter took place this week with the Blues signalling their willingness to allow the Belgium international to leave. While terms of the deal are still being discussed, Chelsea are now looking to bring in another centre forward to spearhead their attack next season. According to ESPN, Tuchel has encouraged his side to join the race to sign Lewandowski, who is pushing to leave Bayern Munich this summer after failing to agree a new contract with the German champions. Barcelona are desperate to sign the 33-year-old but with the Catalan giants still facing major financial uncertainty, Tuchel wants Chelsea to push for a deal that would bring him to Stamford Bridge. Lewandowski will be 34 by the time the new season starts but Tuchel is still convinced the Poland international would still thrive in the Premier League. Chelsea however have other targets on their radar, including RB Leipzig star Christopher Nkunku. The Blues have also been offered Manchester City star Gabriel Jesus, who is available for £50million this summer. Chelsea have asked to be kept informed on any developments but Arsenal are now said to be closing in on a deal to bring the Brazil international to the Emirates. Jesus is said to be eager to link up with Mikel Arteta once again having previously worked with him at City.
