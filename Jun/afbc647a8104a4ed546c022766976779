A social media influencer has reportedly died nearly three months after she fell into a coma from choking on food. Arisara Karbdecho, 27, is said to have been chewing on pork kebabs and sticky rice when the food became lodged in her throat. The Thai model, who had two million followers on social media, was raced to hospital and put on life support last March. But her brain had been deprived of too much oxygen and doctors said they would have had to reach her nine minutes earlier to save her. Tributes poured in for the ‘beautiful’ young woman – well known as ‘Alicebambam’ online – after her family confirmed she had died on June 6. Friend Sirikanda Chaiburut said she was ‘heartbroken’ and ‘shocked’ by the news, The Sun reports. ‘We were shocked when the accident happened but we were all praying she would get better’, she said. ‘She was so young and beautiful. I’m devastated she has gone forever.’ Arisara’s mum has said she was usually very busy with her career and friends and was eating her meal quickly. She said: ‘I would like to remind all teenagers to take good care of their health, eat food on time, and get enough rest. ‘If I were with her, this kind of tragedy wouldn’t have happened. And I don’t want this kind of thing to happen to anyone or any family again.’ Loved ones will say goodbye to Arisara at her funeral on June 11.
