FIFA have announced the host cities and venues for the 2026 World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico. For the first time ever, 48 teams will compete for the FIFA World Cup Trophy as the tournament expands from the 32-team format which will be used for the last time in Qatar later this year. There are 11 host cities in the United States, three in Mexico and a further two in Canada. The cities not picked include Washington D.C/Baltimore, Cincinnati, Denver, Nashville, Orlando and Edmonton. The USA have hosted the World Cup before, in 1994, while the tournament was held in Mexico in 1970 and 1986, however, this is the first edition of the competition to have three host countries. One of the venues chosen for 2026 is Mexico City’s iconic Azteca Stadium, where Argentina legend Diego Maradona scored the infamous ‘Hand of God’ goal against England in 1986. ‘We congratulate the 16 FIFA World Cup host cities on their outstanding commitment and passion,’ FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a statement. ‘Today is a historic day – for everyone in those cities and states, for FIFA, for Canada, the USA and Mexico who will put on the greatest show on Earth. ‘We look forward to working together with them to deliver what will be an unprecedented FIFA World Cup and a game-changer as we strive to make football truly global.’ MORE : Gareth Southgate asks Premier League to not schedule any games between the ‘big-six’ before World Cup MORE : Hungary defeat could be beginning of the end for Gareth Southgate – he needs Harry Maguire more than ever For more stories like this, check our sport page.
