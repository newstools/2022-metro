Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have returned to the US after stepping back into the royal spotlight for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. Photos show the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s plane touching down in California after their fleeting visit to London. Along with children Archie, 3, and Lilibet – who celebrated her first birthday on Saturday – the pair are thought to have left the UK before Her Majesty surprised the crowd outside Buckingham Palace. The monarch was joined by Prince Charles, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and their children. The family of four were nowhere to be seen as they were already on their way home, the Mirror reported. It is thought their trip cost more than £150,000, but it is not clear who footed the bill. According to The Sun, they were driven from their Frogmore Cottage residence to the airport and took off in the afternoon, in the midst of the £15 million Platinum Jubilee Pageant. While Harry and Meghan only took part in one official Jubilee event as royals, they were welcomed back with mostly cheers by the public. They made a brief appearance on Thursday – spotted at the Trooping the Colour event – and later joined other senior royals at the Thanksgiving service on Friday. This was their first official return to the UK after they moved to the US two years ago to lead a more independent life, but their two young children were not seen over the weekend. Since their departure from royal duties, the Sussexes have become divisive figures in British culture. Speculations about a feud between Kate Middleton and Meghan were also only intensified during their visit as the two duchesses were never pictured together.
