A Florida man who was allegedly kidnapped at gunpoint drove erratically in order to attract police attention and get pulled over. Police in Port St Lucie say a dog breeder was kidnapped at his home after three men pretending to be interested in buying dogs assaulted him. The kidnappers reportedly demanded that the man, who had boasted his successful business online, hand over his earnings. What police described as a ‘dangerous saga’ lasted about two days, and moved across several parts of Florida, police said. As the group traveled, the dog breeder, who was forced to drive, saw police patrolling the highway. ‘He intentionally committed a traffic infraction in hopes of being pulled over,’ the Martin County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement. ‘It worked.’ ‘Once stopped, the victim, who had a look of despair when the deputy gave him a warning and started to send him on his way.’ The dog breeder then used ‘a hand motion in hopes that the deputy would pick up on his fear,’ the statement said. The deputy ordered the man to step out of the car and away from the three other men who were still sitting in the vehicle. After police spoke with the victim, the three suspects were arrested. When police searched the vehicle, they discovered a stash of guns, knives and large amounts of cash. Police then arrested Tsdekiel Sellers, 22, of Atlanta, Benyahveen Radcliffe, 22, of Buffalo, and Kashaveeyah Bragdon, 22, of Tallahassee on multiple charges including unlicensed carry of a firearm, possession of a controlled substance, providing a false name, kidnapping, assault, home invasion, false imprisonment and witness tampering. According to authorities, the three men said they were part of ‘the Israelites’ and had only traveled to Florida to ‘hang out with some “b——.’ ‘Not exactly the companions they were looking for, but …Woof,’ the sheriff’s office said.
