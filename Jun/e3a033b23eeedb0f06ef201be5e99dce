Arsenal have cooled their interest in Leicester City star Youri Tielemans in order to focus on a deal for Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus. The Gunners have been in talks with the Belgian’s representatives for months and had been confident of striking a £25m deal for the midfielder, who is out of contract in 12 months’ time. However, Goal report that Arsenal have stepped back from talks as they focus on other deals, of which Jesus is the priority. Mikel Arteta has prioritised signing a striker above all other positions this summer following Alexandre Lacazette’s departure and Jesus is keen on a move to the Emirates, despite interest from Chelsea, Real Madrid and Tottenham. City want £50m for Jesus but the Brazilian’s representatives are on their way to England to thrash out a deal in the hope that they will agree a deal closer to £45m. Should a deal for Jesus get over the line, Arsenal may revisit their interest in Tielemans but that could depend on the fee agreed. Having agreed a deal to sign Fabio Vieira, Arteta’s desire to strengthen his midfield is not as urgent as it once was. The 22-year-old was in London over the weekend to complete a medical at the club before completing his £27m move. Leicester have tabled a contract offer to Tielemans and have not given up hope that the Belgian will remain in the Midlands.
