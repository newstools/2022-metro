An entire British Airways crew is having to isolate for three weeks after one of them tested positive for monkeypox in Singapore. Two pilots and nine stewards and stewardesses have all been put in quarantine for 21 days, it is understood. The group were tested for the rapidly spreading disease on Sunday evening, when they stopped in the south east Asian country on the way back from Australia. A BA insider told Mail Online: ‘One of them had it, so they impounded the whole crew. Now they have got to spend 21 days in quarantine. ‘Everyone has been told not to talk about it – but it’s all everyone is talking about.’ The positive result reportedly came on the return leg of a London-Sydney flight. After completing the outward journey, the group had a one-day stop over in the Australian city before returning to the UK via Singapore. A BA spokesman said: ‘We’re working closely with the Singapore Health Authorities and have offered assistance with any information they require.’ It comes after the UK Health Security Agency (HSA) recommended that gay and bisexual men at high risk of catching monkeypox should be offered the smallpox vaccine. Experts have warned that Britain’s monkeypox outbreak is continuing to grow and is still not under control. Although anyone can catch it, data shows there is a higher level of transmission among men who have sex with other men. The UK has more infections than any other country impacted by the spread of the virus and has now seen the biggest explosion ever recorded outside Africa. Health officials confirmed last week the number of cases has risen to 574 since the first was identified on May 7.  Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
