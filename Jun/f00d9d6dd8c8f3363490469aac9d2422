A man who was to face trial for the murder of his wife and two children has been found dead in prison. Sameer Syed, 38, had been accused of the murder of his wife Seema Banu, his 11-year-old daughter Asfira Riza and six-year-old son Faizan Syed in south Dublin in October 2020. He had been due to stand trial over their deaths on June 15, but was found dead in his cell on Thursday afternoon at Midlands Prison in Portlaoise, County Laois, In a statement, the Irish Prison Service confirmed ‘the death of a prisoner in the Midlands Prison’. It added: ‘All deaths in custody are investigated by the Irish Prison Service, the Inspector of Prisons and An Garda Siochana. The cause of death is determined by the coroner office.’ The children were found to have been strangled while Mrs Banu died from a ligature around her neck, post-mortem examinations revealed. The family had recently moved to Ireland from India. Previously, Seema’s relatives emotionally paid tribute to the ‘very kind-hearted’ mother. They said: ‘When she used to visit India she would spend time with everyone and stay in touch with everyone. ‘She was bold, she has faced all the challenges in her life. She was like one of the main decision-makers for the family. ‘We have lost all three precious gems of our family. We are in shock and extreme pain for losing them.’ Seema’s father, Abdul Ghaffar, died earlier this year. A family member told the Irish Mirror he ‘died from the stress of it all’ and had been ‘heartbroken’ at his daughter’s death. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
