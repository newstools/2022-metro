The Platinum Jubilee bank holiday weekend is finally here – and celebrations will be taking place up and down the country over the next few days. Perhaps you’ve nailed your Jubilee-themed food and drink and street party games. But have you got your royal-themed attire sorted? If not Burberry’s new silk scarf could be just the thing – although you’ll have to part with £300 to own it. The new Italian-woven garment has been brought out to mark the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, with a limited edition print. Paying homage to British woodlands and wildlife, the scarf features yew trees, butterflies and birds from all four nations of the United Kingdom. It also comes with a Platinum Jubilee emblem in the centre. Burberry is also marking the occasion with a donation to the Woodland Trust, a conservation charity. It’s worth pointing out that the scarf has already sold out online, but you should be able to find it in stores. The fashion house truly has gone all out for the celebration, as it’s also unveiled a series of special activations to celebrate – including a partnership with Historic Royal Palaces to support Superbloom, an immersive floral display that will encircle the Tower of London.
