A cleaner with one arm who ‘leaves every room sparkling’ has hit out after being fired from one of his jobs. Daniel Jeffery, 47, worked as a window fitter before a motorbike accident in 1999 forced doctors to amputate his right arm. The married dad-of-three then changed careers and started working as a cleaner. He did so well that he came third out of 4,000 cleaners in an industry competition in 2000, The Sun reports. During the pandemic, Daniel worked eight-hour shifts disinfecting buildings for £9.50 an hour. While working for the Pinnacle Group, he was contracted to clean offices and public buildings for Basildon Council. But a council manager allegedly said Daniel’s work was not up to scratch and he was sacked. He believes things went wrong for him because one specific manager at the council ‘just took a dislike to him’. The unnamed woman allegedly called him ‘Bandit’ and everyone else ended up doing the same. ‘I thought it was meant to be affectionate at first — but she was clearly taking the p***’, Daniel said. The cleaner, from Southend in Essex, claims this manager failed his inspection ‘on purpose’ because ‘there had never been any problems with his work before’. The council is said to have written a letter to Pinnacle about Daniel’s cleaning, demanding he be taken off the job. But the company did not fire him and contracted him to work in London instead. Daniel said: ‘This is just completely unfair. There have never been any complaints like this about my work in the past. ‘It’s just one woman who is prejudiced because I only have one arm.’ Basildon Council said: ‘We have a zero-tolerance approach to bullying and harassment and we take these allegations very seriously. ‘We will fully investigate allegations made by the individual and respond accordingly.’ Pinnacle declined to comment.
