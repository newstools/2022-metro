Doctors must report any suspected case of monkeypox under new rules, it was announced today. It is now a ‘notifiable’ disease, meaning healthcare professionals are obliged to inform their local council or local Health Protection Team. Laboratories must also notify the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) if the monkeypox virus is identified in a laboratory sample. Wendi Shepherd, monkeypox incident director at UKHSA, said: ‘Rapid diagnosis and reporting is the key to interrupting transmission and containing any further spread of monkeypox. ‘This new legislation will support us and our health partners to swiftly identify, treat and control the disease. ‘It also supports us with the swift collection and analysis of data which enables us to detect possible outbreaks of the disease and trace close contacts rapidly, whilst offering vaccinations where appropriate to limit onward transmission.’ New guidance from the UKHSA also says that in order to encourage people to come forward if they have symptoms, all NHS diagnosis and treatment of monkeypox should be free, including to people from overseas who would usually pay charges. More than 300 cases of the disease have now been found in the UK since the outbreak began last month. The UKHSA warned that ‘anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms’. They said that so far people men who have sex with men remain disproportionately affected. Anyone who has multiple sexual partners, or who has ‘close contact with individuals that they don’t know’, has been urged to be vigilant about monkeypox.
