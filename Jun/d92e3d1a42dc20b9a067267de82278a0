Kris Jenner was the life and soul of daughter Khloe Kardashian’s birthday dinner and her drunken toast may be the best ever seen. The Kardashian-Jenner family rallied around Khloe as she celebrated her 38th birthday on Monday. Now that she’s settled into her newly-built $20million (£16m) mega mansion in the Hidden Hills, Los Angeles, Kris, 66, did the honours of hosting Khloe’s celebratory dinner for close family and friends. It’s not known if the scenes were being filmed for the family’s Hulu reality series The Kardashians, but Kim Kardashian kept the cameras rolling and thank goodness she did, as fans got an insight into what really goes down at an intimate Kardashian gathering. Kris looked every inch the hostess with the most, donning a stunning green gown which flowed right down to the floor. After mingling with each other in the huge kitchen, the group then sat down for dinner but not before Kris delivered an iconic speech. With a martini in hand, the matriarch confessed to her guests: ‘I know I’m a little wasted – and a little green – but I just want to say is I am so f*****g in love with you Khloe Kardashian.’ Khloe is heard shouting ‘thank you’ off-camera as Kris’ slurred speech continued: ‘You are a rockstar in my eyes, you are the queen of my family, you are the person who is always looking at the [unintelligible] glass half full.’ ‘What?!’ the entertained guests are heard exclaiming while trying to decipher the business woman’s jumbled words. Kris then burst into random laughter while going on: ‘Who is so amazingly beautiful.’ At this point, she nearly spills her drink prompting boyfriend Corey Gamble, who was luckily sat beside her, to quickly step in to save her beverage by placing it on the table, while she said: ‘Thanks babe.’ Oh, but Kris wasn’t done as she stumbled on: ‘I just want to say how much I love you and I’ve had way too much to drink tonight but we’re here because we love you. ‘We’re here because you make our heart go big [unintelligible].’ Realising she’s out of her depth, Kris asks a friend to ‘chime in for a moment’, and the pal obliges, jumping while wrapping her arms around Kris and joking: ‘I’m gonna be Kris Jenner’s mouth for a moment.’ Kris replied with her speech even more slurred: ‘Thank you because she knows how I feel about you and I can’t control myself. ‘I’ve had a couple of drinks.’ Now that’s how you deliver a speech. Kris’ antics didn’t just stop at the toast, as she was also filmed having a cheeky snog with longtime partner Corey and having a little dance. As well as Kim, Khloe had sister Kendall Jenner in attendance alongside her best friend Malika Haqq, while there was even a glimpse of their brother Rob Kardashian. Hours before the dinner, Kris had wished Khloe a happy birthday in a heartfelt Instagram post, writing: ‘Happy birthday to my beautiful bunny @khloekardashian!!!! I feel so blessed to get to go through this life being your mommy!! ‘You are the most amazing daughter, sister, mommy, auntie, best friend, teacher, therapist, business woman and the funniest girl I know who looks at life with such a beautiful attitude. You are kind, loving, sweet, so smart, generous beyond measure, gracious and you have incredible character. ‘You are the strongest woman I have ever met.

I love you more than you will ever know and I thank God each and every day for you my gorgeous girl. Happy Birthday!!!! 💞💞🥳🥳🎂🎂🙏🙏💕💕 #happybirthdaykhloé.’ Kim, 41, shared pictures of her eating pizza on the floor with her younger sibling and said: ‘Happy Birthday to my number #1 ride or die @khloekardashian. ‘I feel so blessed to be your sister and call you my best friend! No one in this planet deserves the happiness and blessings that are coming your way. Every single person that is blessed to be close to you is a better person because of you.’ The Skims boss added: ‘I am so proud of your heart and how genuine you are. You are always true to yourself and always want what’s best for others! Your heart is so pure that I can feel all of the best energy coming your way. I love you so much and couldn’t get through this life without you.’ Got a story?
