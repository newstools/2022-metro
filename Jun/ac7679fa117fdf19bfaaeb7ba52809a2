Boy George has hit out at British Airways for allegedly making everyone in First Class wait while Victoria Beckham’s driver picked her up directly from the aircraft after a recent flight. The Culture Club star, 61, vented his frustration on Twitter after apparently being made to wait before he could leave a flight they had both been on. He tweeted: ‘Nice touch for @britishairways to leave everyone in first class waiting for steps while Victoria Beckham’s car picks her up at the aircraft. Proper going to avoid flying BA for a while!’ Boy George did not offer any further details on where the flight had flown in from or to, but it is believed to have landed in the UK where he is set to perform in London on Friday night after Culture Club spent the last two weeks touring the US. He appeared to backtrack later, deleting the tweet and adding: ‘I’m an impulse tweeter but I get over it faster than most!’ The singer also clarified: ‘Myself and @britishairways are back in love. Now I know it costs 6,000 to get off the plane before everyone else. ‘Also, my current remit is to be more friendly, human and have more patience. Lol! Wish me luck. I also forgot to say how lovely my flight was!’ It’s not the first time Boy George has butted heads with Victoria, revealing in 2018 that she had refused an autograph for him. He told KIIS 1065’s Kyle and Jackie O: ‘She’s a little bit more serious now isn’t she, but this was a fun moment in her life. ‘I nabbed her at a radio station and said will you write something funny on this for me and she wouldn’t write what I asked her to write, but she wrote, “To the b***h, f**k off!”’ Boy George also later refused to let an act on The Voice perform a Spice Girls song, telling them: ‘The Spice Girls are awful. I hate them. They’ve just got nothing to say. ‘Girl power. Yeah, and what the f**k is girl power? F**k the Spice Girls. ‘They are a cynical corporate creation and proof that a good stylist is more important than a good melody.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted representatives for Victoria Beckham and British Airways for comment.
