Love Island bosses are hoping to spice things up by throwing another sizzling bombshell into the villa for the girls to fight over. It’s been teased that Billy Brown is being lined up to enter the ITV2 dating show and he already has connections to Michael Owen’s daughter Gemma Owen. Billy’s arrival date is not yet known, and it remains unclear as to whether he’ll be one of the hunks headed for Casa Amor. ‘Billy is a ladies man and he’s definitely going to bring some fireworks into the villa,’ an insider said. They added to The Sun: ‘He knows what he wants and isn’t shy about going after someone he fancies – whether they are in a couple or not.’ Although Gemma’s link to Billy has not yet been revealed, she’s already got one ex-boyfriend, Jacques O’Neill, with her in the villa. While Love Island fans are convinced that the international dressage rider, 19, will get back with her former flame, her auntie Lesley has insisted that their romance is over. Appearing on Aftersun on Sunday, she told host Laura Whitmore: ‘No, it’s definitely done. They’re just friends. Definitely friends.’ Love Island is set for drama tonight (June 22) with newcomer Antigoni Buxton heading onto the show as the latest bombshell. The 26-year-old singer-songwriter from London will no doubt cause disruption to the pairings they’re starting to settle into. Ahead of her entrance, Antigoni said: ‘I’ve been single for almost a year and a half and for the whole of the last year my goal has been to have as many different experiences as possible. ‘I really just want to say yes to things. Why not? It’ll be fun. I’m a Cypriot girl and I love being in the sun. I’ve got nothing to lose!’ Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
