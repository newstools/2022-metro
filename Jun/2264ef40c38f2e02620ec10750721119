Bon Jovi have been left ‘heartbroken’ by the death of the band’s founding member and first bassist Alec John Such. The band, Jon Bon Jovi, David Bryan, Tico Torres, Phil X, and Hugh McDonald, announced the death of the musician in an emotional statement. It read: ‘We are heartbroken to hear the news of the passing of our dear friend Alec John Such. ‘He was an original. As a founding member of Bon Jovi, Alec was integral to the forming of the band. ‘To be honest, we found our way to each other thru him – he was a childhood friend of Tico and brought Richie [Sambora] to see us perform [sic]. ‘Alec was always wild and full of life. Today those special memories bring a smile to my face and a tear to my eye. We’ll miss him dearly’. Such helped to form Bon Jovi in 1983 but left in 1994. He was replaced by McDonald. Born in New York, Such was first part of the band Message before joining Bon Jovi. As they said in their statement, Such brought Torres into the band, as well as Sambora, before he left in 2013. Such previously said of his departure: ‘When I was 43, I started to get burned out. ‘It felt like work, and I didn’t want to work. The reason I got into a band to begin with is because I didn’t want to work.’ When Bon Jovi was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, Such reunited with them for the momentous occasion. ‘When Jon Bon Jovi called me up and asked me to be in his band many years ago, I soon realised how serious he was and he had a vision that he wanted to bring us to, and I am too happy to have been a part of that vision,’ he said at the time. ‘These guys are the best. We had so many great times together and we wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for those guys. Love them to death and always will.’ MORE : The Big Questions: KISS’ Gene Simmons on ‘resilience’ of UK fans, Radiohead, and the death of music… MORE : Ed Sheeran says Queen’s Golden Jubilee 20 years ago is the reason he’s a musician
