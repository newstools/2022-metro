Dan Walker has revealed his daughter is in hospital with a suspected broken finger. The former BBC Breakfast presenter shared that he is currently sat with her while she waits for medical attention. Sharing a picture of his daughter’s hand, Dan penned: ‘Currently in A & E with our daughter who has a suspected broken finger 🤕 4 hour wait has begun ⏰’ Dan, 45, shares three children, daughters Jessica and Susanna and son Joe, with Sarah, his wife of 20 years. He rarely posts pictures of his kids, but when he does they often have their backs to the camera or have emojis covering their faces. The broadcaster didn’t share whether it was Jessica or Susanna who had been injured or just how they hurt themselves. In another tweet, Dan added: ‘The hospital is brilliant and they are understaffed today because of “unforeseen absences” (there is a sign up). Very thankful she is getting seen at some stage.’ Hopefully, his daughter will be bandaged up in no time! Earlier this month, Dan poked fun at his rival Piers Morgan by jokingly storming out of his Good Morning Britain interview. The former BBC Breakfast presenter, who recently started his new position at Channel 5 News, joined Susanna Reid and Richard Madeley in the ITV studio. After claiming Piers had once paid for paparazzi to turn up at their charity golf game, Dan got up from behind his desk and proceeded to make a beeline for the exit. ‘I’m going to do what they normally do on this programme,’ Dan said as he got up. ‘Storm off.’ Of course, Piers made headlines in March 2021 when he quit Good Morning Britain following an on-air clash with weatherman Alex Beresford over Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s interview with Oprah Winfrey. Before he departed the show, however, the no-nonsense host dramatically stormed out in the middle of a row with Alex. Got a story?
