Flights had to be diverted and delayed today after a Ryanair flight landed ‘heavily’ and then got ‘stuck’ on a runway. The flight from Faro in Portugal is believed to have suffered a landing gear malfunction after landing at Leeds Bradford Airport this morning. Firefighters surrounded the Ryanair 737 flight after it landed at 8.45am. One passenger tweeted: ‘A bit of drama on our landing at Leeds Bradford Airport this morning. ‘A very heavy landing followed by a very abrupt stop. ‘Unable to tow the plane back to the terminal so getting into buses on the runway.’ Another social media user claimed a tyre had blown out. It led to delays at the airport, with an inbound Jet2 flight from Gerona diverted to Manchester Airport due to the temporary closure of the runway. Another inbound, this time from Mahon, was diverted to East Midlands and a flight from Palma has gone to Manchester. Several flights outbound were also delayed, including a Ryanair flight to Faro, a Jet2 flight to Paris and a Flybe plane to Belfast City. Leeds Bradford Airport has confirmed that firefighters were sent to the runway. The LBA spokesman said: ‘Our on-site fire operations attended the runway to support an inbound Ryanair flight experiencing difficulties upon landing. ‘Passenger safety is our biggest priority and our team acted promptly to manage the incident. ‘As part of this we took the decision to divert four flights to nearby airports while we assisted the flight. All passengers disembarked safely, and operations have returned to normal.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
