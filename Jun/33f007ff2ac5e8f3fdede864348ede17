A trainee police officer drew red lines on a Covid lateral flow test to get time off work, a misconduct hearing has been told. Ahmed Anwar told his training officer he had to stay at home after testing positive for the virus. But his deceit was laid bare after he wad asked to send a photograph of the result as proof. It was clear the test ‘had been manually altered with drawn red lines’ on the test strip. Anwar, based at Lancashire Constabulary, was invited to take a second Covid test via an online Microsoft Teams meeting – which he again lied about being positive. But he was forced to admit falsifying the results after being confronted by his manager. He admitted he wanted to stay at home under then self-isolation rules. Anwari quit the force the following day. Chairing Monday’s hearing, Chief Constable Chris Rowley found Anwari had breached standards of professional behaviour and in doing so had committed gross misconduct. He said: ‘I find that had Mr Anwari still been a member of Lancashire Constabulary he would have been dismissed. ‘Police officers must keep in mind at all times that the public expect them to maintain high standards of professional behaviour.’ Mr Anwari chose not to attend the hearing in Ormskirk and was not legally represented.
