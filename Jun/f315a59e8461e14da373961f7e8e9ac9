Three people were shot and killed at a manufacturing facility in Maryland on Thursday afternoon. Deputies responded to an active shooting on the 12900 block of Bikle Road in Smithsburg around 2.30pm, according to the Washington County Sheriff’s Office. ‘At this time the Sheriff’s Office can confirm that there are multiple victims and the suspect is no longer a threat to the community,’ the sheriff’s office posted on Facebook. Three people were found dead at Columbia Machine Inc and a fourth person was critically injured, according to the sheriff’s office. The suspect and a trooper exchanged gunfire and were both wounded. ‘The suspect fired and shot the state trooper in the shoulder, who then returned fire and shot him,’ said Maryland Governor Larry Hogan. Initially, the shooter fled in a vehicle and was tracked down by Maryland State cops. The shooter was transported to a hospital, in a condition not immediately known. Columbia Machine is a company that offers ‘complete equipment lines to customers in over 100 countries’, according to its website. The facility is located near Smithsburg High and Middle Schools. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ Baltimore office tweeted that it was assisting the sheriff’s office in the shooting. Rep David Trone, whose district includes Smithsburg, called it a ‘mass shooting’ and said he was monitoring the situation. ‘Our office is in contact with officials on the ground,’ tweeted Trone. ‘If you’re local, please stay away from the area as law enforcement responds.’ Images from the scene showed a large presence of law enforcement and emergency vehicles. Authorities did not immediately have information whether the victims and shooter were employed by Columbia Machine, said Sheriff’s Office Sgt Carly Hose. Smithsburg is about 75 miles northwest of Washington, DC. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
