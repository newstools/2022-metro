Homes were evacuated in Bradford when toxic chemicals linked to drug manufacturing were discovered. A ‘disturbance’ at a property in Westcroft Road, Great Horton resulted in police being called to the scene on Saturday afternoon. The premises were searched – with chemicals and evidence of drug production found. A man has been arrested on suspicion of the production of Class A drugs. He remains in custody. A cordon was put in place for public safety, while specialist police and fire service resources were deployed. There is no risk from the chemicals to anyone outside of the house where they were found, a spokesperson from West Yorkshire Police assured people today. But the cordon will remain in place for days to allow the safe removal and disposal of the substances. A forensic examination of the property will be launched to help the criminal investigation. Locals living on the street have been warned of further disruption and asked for their patience. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
