Morning Live had viewers at home gasping on Tuesday’s programme after Strictly Come Dancing’s Janette Manrara accidentally booted a dog in the face. The BBC One show took a dramatic turn at the end of the episode when the professional dancer and It Takes Two co-host was spun around the studio floor by fellow dancer Aljaž Škorjanec. After presenter Gethin Jones wrapped up the show, Janette and Aljaž were showing off their moves and curious dog Dolly moved closer and closer to the action. But disaster struck within a matter of seconds when Dolly got a little too close and was kicked right in the snout by Janette. The stars in the studio were heard crying out after the pooch got hit and the cameras immediately stopped rolling. Although the incident was a blink and you’d miss it moment, it didn’t go unnoticed by horrified viewers at home. ‘Hope the dog is ok, after getting booted in the head,’ wrote one. ‘I hope that dogs ok! Just got smacked in the face by a dancer,’ another said. A third wrote: ‘Ermmm I swear the dog on #MorningLive just held a boot to the face. Poor thing.’ Dolly the dog is owned by vet Dr James Greenwood and she had been brought into the studio along with fellow pet Oliver. Dr James offered his tips on dog grooming during the first part of the programme while his furry friends lay comfortably on the flood. After the head-butting incident, he confirmed that Dolly is a-okay. ‘She is totally fine!’ Dr James reassured fans. ‘Getting stuck into a chew stick on the way home.’ Morning Live airs weekdays from 9am on BBC One.
