Fabio Vieira has promised to do everything he can to make a success of his Arsenal career ahead of a £34m move from Porto. Portuguese side Porto confirmed on Friday that they had reached an agreement to sell Vieira to Arsenal for 40m euro (£34.2m). The Gunners will pay an initial 35m euros (£29.9m) for Vieira with the rest in potential add-ons. Vieira, a highly-rated midfielder who recorded a league-high 14 assists in the Primeira Liga last season to help Porto win the title, will become Arsenal’s third summer signing following goalkeeper Matt Turner and forward Marquinhos. Discussing his move to north London for the first time, Vieira said: ‘I was always happy at Porto but this chance is important for any professional. I have always watched the Premier League on TV. ‘Playing in the Premier League won’t be easy and I promise only to work, work, work. ‘My agent worked on the deal between the two clubs and I accepted the deal because it was important for all parties.’ More to follow…
