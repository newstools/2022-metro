McDonald’s capitalist era in Russia is officially over after 32 years – emblematic of the turmoil in the country. This is the moment workers removed the iconic sign and the ‘Golden Arches’ from a branch in St Petersburg after the American chain closed over the war in Ukraine. For a generation of Russians, McDonald’s represented an end to the Soviet Union, so the move left many people angry and disappointed. This even prompted protests and lengthy lines for a Happy Meal. After the international company announced plans to leave the country for good, billionaire Alexander Govor purchased its entire portfolio consisting of nearly 840 restaurants. ‘We have a challenging and ambitious plan – to reopen all of the restaurants in two months,’ the local licensee, who initially owned 25 McDonald’s branches in Siberia, told Forbes Russia. ‘There are now 840 restaurants ready to be relaunched… My global plan is to increase the chain to 1,000 restaurants nationwide in the next few years.’ The mass reopening of the rebrand is set to begin with the Pushkin Square branch in Moscow on Sunday. It was its first location in the country, opening in 1990 – just months before the fall of the Soviet Union. Mr Govor added that the process to choose a new brand name was ongoing. But patent filings from last month show that it could be ‘Fun and Tasty’, CNN reported. Other questionable contenders include ‘Just Like That’, ‘Open Checkout’ and ‘The Same One’. The new owner, who built his fortune in the Russian coal and oil sectors, is yet to reveal how much he paid but said there were other bidders who wanted to take over the entire chain. A spokesperson said last week: ‘We are working on creating a new brand and have already sent applications for the registration of several names. ‘In the future, one of all registered names will be selected.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
