Fancy a treat that looks super impressive, is easy to make, and that kids and grownups will love? Here’s a recipe that ticks all those boxes: pineapple puff pastry flowers. These tasty pastries work just as well for picnics as for a speedy dessert when you’re craving something sweet, and use tinned pineapple to get rid of any faff. I like having them with custard and apple, or chucking some bananas on top. Here’s how to make your own. For more tasty recipes for kids and grownups to enjoy, head to my Instagram, @squashedpickle.
