Prince Louis has well and truly stolen the show on the Buckingham Palace balcony. Dressed in an adorable sailor outfit, the youngest Cambridge royal showed an impressive array of funny faces and even saluted the crowds at the end of the Trooping the Colour parade. The four-year-old’s nautical look has a special significance as it was worn by his father Prince William 37 years ago. William was just three-years-old in 1985 when he donned the same outfit for Trooping the Colour. Nearly four decades later, the Duke of Cambridge’s children joined the Queen and the royal family to kick off the Platinum Jubilee celebrations. The young Cambridge royals arrived by horse and carriage for the military pageant, sat opposite their mother Kate Middleton and step-granny Camilla. Dressed in a cornflower blue dress, Charlotte appeared to push Louis’s hand down at one point and squinted in the morning sunshine as the carriage left the palace.     Louis sat between his older siblings and enthusiastically greeted the throngs of people on The Mall. They arrived minutes after several people were arrested attempting to block the ceremonial route. On horseback in their military regalia were Prince Charles, Prince William and Princess Anne. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
