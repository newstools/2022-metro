The Queen’s plane had to abort landing on Tuesday as thunder and lightning forced it to stay in the air. Her Majesty, 96, returned to London from Scotland yesterday – with just one day until celebrations for her historic Platinum Jubilee kick-off. But mid-air drama ensued when the 13-seater jet was caught in an electrical storm, rain and hail. The pilot circled the plane over the capital for 15 minutes before eventually making a second successful landing at RAF Northolt, North West London. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said: ‘The Queen’s flight was delayed due to a lightning storm, all the correct procedures were followed and there were no safety concerns.’ The monarch was later seen arriving back at Windsor Castle with her corgis in tow. She had travelled to Balmoral last Thursday for a short break in order to pace herself ahead of the busy four-day weekend of festivities. It is the first time Britain has ever had a monarch on the throne for 70 years. The commemorations start with the traditional Trooping the Colour military spectacle on Thursday, involving more than 1,500 officers and soldiers and 350 horses from the Household Division. The Head of State is predicted to make an appearance on the balcony alongside other working members of the Royal Family. But it remains unclear which events she will appear at as she faces episodic mobility problems. There is speculation the Queen will attend her great-granddaughter Lilibet’s first birthday on Saturday after she cancelled plans to go to the Derby. She has never met Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s daughter and hasn’t seen Lilibet’s brother Archie in years – but this will change, with the four Sussexes due to land in the UK today. Buckingham Palace has refused to comment on the Queen’s diary and will confirm her attendances on the day. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
