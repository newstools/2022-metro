Meet Boy, a mixed Persian kitten who won’t need much for his Halloween costume this year. Just stick a black cape on and he’s done. Why? Because the nine-month old cat is a dead ringer for Zorro, the masked vigilante. That’s thanks to not only his natural black eye mask, but also a matching black ‘hat’ on top. Boy has received a lot of attention and love online thanks to his unusual Zorro-esque markings. ‘The cat’s name is Boy, but many people call him Zorro,’ said owner Indraini Wahyudin Noor, 50, from Banjarmasin, Indonesia. ‘I have many cats but this is the only one who has a mask on his face. He’s my favourite cat!’ Boy has not yet shown any signs of being like Zorro in ways other than his appearance. He does not appear to have any sword skills, and hasn’t yet been storming into castles to save a damsel in distress. Instead, he just likes a snuggle. We feel that. ‘He is a very spoiled cat,’ says Indraini. ‘He always wants to be petted, cuddled and held. ‘He likes to be play a lot but he hates being bathed each week.’ When Indraini shared videos of Boy online, people quickly commented on the cat’s resemblance to the fictional character. Now, to celebrate having a tiny Zorro in his midst, Indraini regularly plays the film’s theme tune. He added: ‘I also think he looks just like Zorro, and I think he likes regularly listening to the Zorro music. ‘People who see him for the first time usually say that he’s unique, cute and how he looks just like Zorro. They even call him the cat thief! ‘Reactions from my subscribers are mostly cute, they want to hug him and some even want to have him.’ Do you have a story to share?
