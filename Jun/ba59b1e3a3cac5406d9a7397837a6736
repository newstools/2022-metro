Amid reports Nick Cannon is expecting his ninth child, the star has taken aim at his expanding brood in a cheeky skit alongside Ryan Reynolds ahead of Father’s Day. The presenter is currently awaiting the arrival of his eighth child, after announcing model Bre Tiesi was pregnant earlier this year, however claims emerged this week he was also the father of Abby De La Rosa’s baby, due in October, which would make him a dad of nine. Nick revealed he attempted to go celibate last year, which really didn’t pan out well, so evidently, Ryan thought a ‘vasectomy’ was the next logical step. Because, according to Nick: ‘Lord knows I need one.’ Not your run of the mill surgical procedure, though, the Aviation Gin owner enlisted Nick as the face of a cocktail called ‘The Vasectomy’ ahead of Father’s Day, with a comical clip showing the father-of-eight/nine putting together the tipple, made with cranberry juice, tonic water, lemon juice and Ryan’s famous gin. Taking a tall glass of ice, musing ‘children fill our lives with so much joy’ Nick then goes to add tonic water, which is bubbly ‘just like I feel every day I wake up after a long full night’s sleep’. As Nick continues to assemble the cocktail, he instructs us to add 1.5oz of the gin, noting through gritted teeth: ‘The world’s highest-rated gin for the world’ highest rated job…dad’, as he glugs a hefty pour into the glass before the director calls cut and he does the step again with a measured pour. Once ready to sip, Ryan – who shares three daughters with wife Blake Lively – saunters in and takes the cocktail, telling Nick: ‘I’ll take it from here—I have three kids.’ Turning to the camera, Nick replies: ‘I have eight,’ as Ryan spits out the drink and later adds, while hugging Nick: ‘No wonder you have eight kids, you smell amazing!’ The clip couldn’t have come at a more intriguing time, amid reports the Wild N Out star is expecting another baby with Abby, with Ryan even poking fun at the news by writing alongside the clip: ‘Congrats to Nick Cannon! ‘Yes, it’s delicious, but the Aviation Vasectomy is clearly not yet 100% effective.’ Insider sources revealed that Abby’s due date is October 25, and that Nick is the father, according to TMZ. Abby announced her pregnancy on Friday, even teasing the idea of having twins (which would then make it baby number nine and 10 for Nick), but it has not been confirmed. Sharing a photo of herself sitting on a bed and surrounded by balloons, including ones that spelled out ‘baby’, the 31-year-old model wrote: ‘IM PREGNANT 🥰 Another set of twins?!’ Nick and Abby also share 11-month-old twins, Zion and Zillion Heir, while Nick has five other children with three other women: twins Moroccan and Monroe, 11, with ex-wife Mariah Carey, and Golden ‘Sagon’, five, and one-year-old Powerful Queen with Brittany Bell. His baby boy with Alyssa Scott, Zen, died in December, aged five months, after being diagnosed with a brain tumour. The former America’s Got Talent Host, who recently opened up on fatherhood and shared how ‘engaged’ he was in all of his children’s lives, also played it coy during an episode of Angela Yee’s Lip Service podcast, released on Tuesday. When asked if he was expecting three more children, he responded: ‘When you say “on the way…” what count are you at? Let’s just put it this way… the stork is on the way.’ He then laughed: ‘I don’t know, it could be… If you thought it was a lot of kids last year.’ Nick also quipped that she was ‘pretty good at math’ when Angela predicted due dates for his new bundle/s of joy in September or October. The 41-year-old gave a personal update too, reflecting on his failed mission to remain celibate after a counsellor, who he sought to get to the root of his rampant sex life, told him he ‘needed to chill out’. The star admitted his abstinence began in October, but he ‘didn’t even make it to [January]’. ‘I was supposed to make it to the top of the year. Then obviously I started going through some stuff… I got depressed with the loss of my son,’ Nick explained. ‘So in December… the thing is everybody saw I was so down. So everybody was like, “Let’s just give him a little vagina, and that’s gonna cure it all.”’ Saying that he ‘fell victim to it ‘cause I was in a weak state’, he charmingly divulged that in December he started ‘f*****g like crazy’.
