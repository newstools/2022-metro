A 62-year-old man has been killed after a bear he attempted to kill turned on him. The bear killed the hunter before succumbing to its own fatal injuries, with the bodies of both later found not far from one another. The unnamed hunter is believed to have shot and wounded the predator from a platform in a tree in the Tulun district of the Irkutsk region, Russia. It is thought the man believed he had killed the bear and descended from the tree only to be attacked and killed by the beast in its final act. ‘When a 62-year-old man climbed down, the mortally wounded bear attacked and killed him,’ Interfax reported. ‘The carcass of the animal was found 50 metres from the place where the man died.’ The hunter’s skull was ‘crushed’ in the attack and he suffered claw and fang wounds, it has been reported. ‘The mortally wounded predator managed to inflict an injury from which the hunter died,’ said the regional office of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. The hunter had been reported missing. The macabre scene was discovered after a search party had been organised in the Siberian region.
