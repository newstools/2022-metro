The average cost of filling a typical family car with petrol has exceeded £100 for the first time. A litre of petrol at UK forecourts reached a record 182.3p on Wednesday, according to figures from data firm Experian Catalist. That was an increase of 1.6p from the previous day, taking the average cost of filling a 55-litre family car to £100.27. Meanwhile the average price of a litre of diesel was recorded at 188.1p on Wednesday. The situation is likely to get worse, as the cost of living crisis continues to grip the  country. Forecourts at motorway service stations are already selling petrol and diesel for more than £2 per litre. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said the average price of petrol crossing the ‘thoroughly depressing threshold of £100 a tank’ meant it was ‘a truly dark day’ for drivers. He added: ‘There’s almost certainly going to be upward inflationary pressure, which is bad news for everybody. ‘While fuel prices have been setting new records on a daily basis, households up and down the country may never have expected to see the cost of filling an average-sized family car reach three figures.’ Mr Williams said many people will be hoping for further financial support from the Government as the 5p per litre cut in fuel duty ‘looks paltry’ because wholesale petrol costs have increased by five times that amount since it was implemented in March. ‘A further duty cut or a temporary reduction in VAT would go a long way towards helping drivers, especially those on lower incomes who have no choice other than to drive,’ he added.
