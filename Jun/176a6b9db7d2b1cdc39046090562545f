Love Island 2022 contestant Davide Sanclimenti has been confirmed as the first bombshell of the brand new ITV2 series, which kicks off tonight. In spoilers ahead of this evening’s instalment, the Italian stallion rocks up to the Majorcan villa no sooner than the first batch of bombshells have been coupled up by the public. While Davide’s entrance ruffles a few feathers among the boys, the girls can’t get enough. Speaking in the Beach Hut, Indiyah Polack admits: ‘When I saw him, I was very confused because I had no warning but he is very good looking!’ Michael Owen’s daughter Gemma Owen is also taken aback, adding: ‘I was blown away.’ ‘Straight away I was like, “Wow. Fit. Hot. Sexy. Hercules”,’ Tasha Ghouri, the show’s first deaf contestant, added. Davide is loving the look of the ladies too. ‘When I walked into the Villa, I saw all the girls and I’m really impressed, I’m not going to lie,’ he says. But it appears Davide’s entrance may cause a stir among the boys. Speaking in the Beach Hut, Luca Bish, admits: ‘Davide! I was thinking I’m the good-looking Italian here and then you’ve sent that geezer through the door.’ Shortly after Davide’s arrival, the Islanders play a game of dares. Davide is up first and he has to ‘do a strip tease’ which catches the attention of the girls. After the game, the new arrival receives a text which is set to shake the villa. ‘Davide, in 24 hours you will couple up with a girl of your choice, leaving one boy single and vulnerable #italiansnack #ciaobella,’ it reads. But which girl has Davide got his eye on? Love Island airs tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
