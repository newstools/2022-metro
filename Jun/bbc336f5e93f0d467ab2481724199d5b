Not so very long ago, the only reasons for visiting Colindale were to buy a car, visit the RAF museum, or be involved in training – or teaching – at the Peel Centre, commonly known as Hendon Police College. But now this once-overlooked suburb is undergoing widespread regeneration, with more than 10,100 homes being built. Many apartment blocks are now finished and the area’s getting a buzz as new residents flock to its shops and eateries. Even the station, on the Edgware branch of the Northern line, has had a makeover, and the North Circular and Brent Cross are close. As well new build, Colindale has Edwardian, 1930s and 1970s housing. These older homes might not be NW London’s loveliest, but what they lack in looks they more than make up for in affordability. Flats start at just under £300,000, with houses from under £500,000. The new homes are attracting a mix of buyers. ‘We’ve seen a spike in first-time buyers using Help to Buy, plus international investors and some downsizers,’ says Joel Ellis-Duffy, sales manager of the North West London New Homes and Investments team at Foxtons. ‘Colindale was once a compromise but now it’s a choice.’ Redrow is delivering over 4,000 homes at Colindale Gardens, its flagship London development. A fifth of the site is allocated to green spaces and amenities include a gym, sauna, 24-hour concierge and play area, and a health centre and new primary school are planned. One, two and three-bedroom flats are currently available, with open-plan living areas and a balcony or terrace, from £375,000 to £675,00. Sage Homes has shared ownership flats at Colindale Gardens, with wood flooring and integrated Bosch kitchen appliances. One-bedroom homes start at £92,500 for a 25 per cent share of £370,000, with two-bedroom flats from £120,000 for 25 per cent of £480,000. Beaufort Park, by St George, is set in 25 acres with parkland and an on-site swimming pool, treatment room, sauna, spa and gym, a nursery, dentist, hair salon and shops. All homes are open-plan with A-rated energy-efficient integrated appliances and private outside space. From £317,950 for a one-bedroom flat with Help to Buy available. The same developer has launched Silkstream, towards Hendon. One, two and three-bedroom flats start at £383,000. At TNQ, 460 one, two and three-bed flats are in five buildings, with underfloor heating, LED lights and fibre optic cabling. There’s a gym, concierge, crèche, shared courtyards and terraces. From £470,000 with Help to Buy. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
