A ‘hero’ father has died after rescuing a group of children from a sudden riptide off the coast of Wales. Hywel Morgan, 47, helped save the children who had got into difficulty in the sea at Poppit Sands, near the village of St Dogmaels. The tragic events unfolded on Friday evening when several people were caught in a riptide on the beach. Mr Morgan, who was from the local area, was recovered from the sea but could not be saved by the emergency services. Two children were taken to hospital to be checked over following the incident. Mr Morgan’s loved ones issued a short tribute to the ‘devoted and loving father’, who was known as Hyw by family and friends. ‘Hyw was a hero. Despite our pain and grief, it gives us comfort that he selflessly tried to prevent others from losing their lives,’ they said. ‘Hyw was a selfless individual who always gave up his time for others. He was a devoted and loving father and was loved and respected by all who knew him. ‘As a family, we would now like time to grieve and would ask for privacy in which to do so.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
