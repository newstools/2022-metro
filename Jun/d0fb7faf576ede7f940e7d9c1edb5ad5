A drink driver has been jailed for leaving a woman with life-changing injuries after he crashed into her. Michael Marsden, 23, went on a bottomless brunch event in Guildford, Surrey, where he drank 11 cocktails on June 4 last year. After that he drove his BMW to several pubs in Aldershot, Hampshire, where he had another 15 shots and two pints of lager. In the early hours of the following morning he hit Angel Taylor, 21, as she walked home, causing horrific injuries that resulted in her losing her leg. Her life was only saved when a police superintendent and a paramedic who were both off-duty applied a tourniquet to prevent blood loss. Marsden fled from the scene and went home to Farnham. When he was tracked down, his car had a wing mirror missing and there was a crack to the front bumper. He claimed he had hit an animal in foggy weather, but police did not believe him and he was arrested. His phone records show he had been looking at Surrey Police’s website the day after hitting Angel on Farnham Bypass and he had messaged friends about it. He admitted what he had done at Guildford Crown Court on Friday. Marsden was jailed for three years and banned from driving for four years. Detective Constable Rick Edwards, said: ‘Throughout this investigation, Marsden has shown no remorse for what he has done and has even been witnessed mocking the collision amongst his friends. ‘The victim has shown immense bravery this past year and I hope that this result gives her some closure and allows her to move forward with her life. ‘It was extremely lucky that superintendent Adam Smith was driving past at that moment and he, along with the paramedics involved, saved the young victims life.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
