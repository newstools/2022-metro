This 10,000-year-old cave in rural Wales is the stuff of every history lover’s fantasy. It holds deep and fascinating secrets even the likes of ancient explorers would find intriguing. Nestled under Pembroke Castle in west Wales, the cave boasts the recent discovery of some woolly mammoth’s bones dating back 10,000 years. The cave system itself dates back to the Stone Age and was the birthplace of the first Tudor king Henry VII. The cave and castle are located at the mouth of the Irish Sea, which became an important place for storage during the Middle Ages. The cave was incorporated into the castle’s defences during the 13th century and a large water gate was built across its mouth. As a result of the recent find at the cave, archaeologists now hope to delve further into the secrets the cave has to offer and how it was used by early humans during the Ice Age. Scientists have already discovered the site is an important part of the Mesolitihic period after reindeer and woolly mammoth bones were discovered last year. Dr Rob Dinnis of the University of Aberdeen and Dr Jenni French of the University of Liverpool will lead the dig to uncover parts of the cave hidden for tens of thousands of years. Dr Dinnis said: ‘We are incredibly excited about this year’s excavation. Prior to our work next to nothing was known about the archaeology of Wogan Cavern. ‘It has long been assumed that the cave was dug out either during the medieval period when it formed part of the castle or during the very poorly-recorded Victorian antiquarian digs. ‘Our work shows that is not the case. Instead it is now clear that the cave has real potential as an early prehistoric site.’ The dig is set to be funded by the British Cave Research Association and the Natural History Museum.
