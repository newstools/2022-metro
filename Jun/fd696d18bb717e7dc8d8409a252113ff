A driver was pulled over after police spotted a pint of San Miguel perched on his dashboard. The van driver was stopped by Merseyside Police’s road policing unit in Kirkby at around 10.40pm on Monday. Reporting the incident on Twitter, police shared a photo of the pint glass sitting on the vehicle’s dashboard. Officers said the 31-year-old driver was ‘too drunk’ to provide a breath analysis and was arrested at the scene. ‘Any idea what made us stop this one?,’ the force said. ‘Driver was too drunk to provide and he’s been arrested and is now in custody. Another selfish drink driver off the roads.’ In an update today, a spokesperson for Merseyside Police said the 31-year-old man, from Bootle, had been arrested and remains in custody. ‘Officers stopped a van in the Whitefield Drive area of Kirkby at around 10.40pm last night,’ the statement read. ‘A 31-year-old man from Bootle was arrested on suspicion of failing to provide a specimen for analysis, failing to co-operate with a preliminary test, possession of a controlled drug of Class A (cocaine) and using a vehicle without third party insurance.
