Rebel Wilson has spoken out about almost being ‘outed’ by an Australian publication. The 42-year-old actress shared that she is in a relationship with a woman earlier this week after finding her ‘Disney princess’ and shared a selfie with her new partner on Instagram. However, since then the Sydney Morning Herald admitted they gave Rebel ‘two days’ to comment on her new relationship with girlfriend Ramona Agruma before they would take it into their own hands. Before the publication could ‘out’ Rebel, she shared an adorable selfie of herself cosying up to her partner Ramona, with beaming smiles on their faces. She captioned the photo: ‘I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince… but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess 💗🌈💗 #loveislove.’ Rebel has spoken out about the situation for the first time and thanked her fans for their support. ‘Thanks for your comments, it was a very hard situation but trying to handle it with grace,’ she penned. Her post came after a journalist wrote on Twitter: ‘So apparently it wasn’t @RebelWilson’s choice to come out… The @smh/@theage have admitted to giving her a heads up 2 days in advance that they were going to “out” her. ‘What’s worse, openly gay men at the Sydney Morning Herald were involved in this.’ ‘This is thoroughly depressing,’ wrote one. ‘People should be able to come out when they are ready. It can be fraught with emotion, stress and even danger. Do better!’ ‘Utterly vile publication with immoral sickos as the management team. Disgusting,’ said another. The Sydney Morning Herald has been slammed for attempting to ‘out’ Rebel, with many critiquing its ‘vile’ approach. Bevan Shields, the editor of The Sydney Morning Herald, has denied any wrongdoing. In a statement, he wrote: ‘On Saturday, the Herald published an article about Australian actor Rebel Wilson and her new partner Ramona Agruma. The article ran online and was a small item on page 36 of Saturday’s print edition. The article has promoted some public attention and I’ve been reading this feedback closely. In the interests of transparency I wanted to offer the Herald’s view on this issue. ‘Our weekly Private Sydney celebrity column last week asked Wilson if she wished to comment about her new partner. We would have asked the same questions had Wilson’s new partner been a man.’ The statement continued: ‘To say that the Herald “outed” Wilson is wrong. Like other mastheads do every day, we simply asked questions and as standard practice included a deadline for a response. ‘I had made no decision about whether or what to publish, and the Herald’s decision about what to do would have been informed by any response Wilson supplied. ‘Wilson made the decision to publicly disclose her new partner – who had been a feature of her social media accounts for months.’ It concluded: ‘Private Sydney is a column in which the writer’s interaction with his subjects is often part of the story. Saturday’s piece followed that theme in giving readers insights into our interaction with Wilson and her PR team. This was not a standard news story. ‘We wish Wilson and Agruma well.’ Rebel’s last relationship was with Jacob Busch, whose family founded the brewing company Anheuser-Busch. The pair went Instagram-official in November 2020 but confirmed the following February that they had split. Just last November, the Isn’t It Romantic star revealed she was putting dating on the back burner after seeing a few people over summer and ‘having a really nice time.’ Got a story?
