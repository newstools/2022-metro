More than 400 people crossed the English Channel on the day the first Rwanda flight was cancelled in a humiliating blow to the government. Eleven small boats were intercepted on Tuesday off Dover, Ramsgate and Dungeness in Kent, carrying 444 asylum seekers. This is the highest number since 562 migrants were recorded coming over on April 14 earlier this year. Their arrival to the UK comes after Boris Johnson and Priti Patel insisted their new scheme will discourage migrants from making the perilous journey. A heavily pregnant woman, a number of babies and one father carrying his toddler son on his shoulders were among those rescued and brought ashore yesterday. When asked where they came from, they said Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Questioned on if they knew they could be sent to Rwanda, one person replied: ‘What? No’, while others appeared to look confused. Last night the first plane to the East African country was grounded right before take off after the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) stepped in. The relocation scheme has been named ‘absolutely chilling’ and ‘cruel’ by critics. Prince Charles is reported to have named the policy ‘appalling’, while the Archbishop of Canterbury said it would not ‘stand the judgment of God’. But Mr Johnson has accused lawyers representing migrants of ‘abetting the work of criminal gangs’. The home secretary insisted last night she would ‘not be deterred from doing the right thing’. With warm weather and low winds predicted for Wednesday, it is anticipated more crossings will be attempted. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
