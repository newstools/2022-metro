We thought we were able to handle David Beckham’s adorable Italian sojourn with 10-year-old daughter Harper, after they were spotted in Venice on the weekend, but then he had to go and share a photo dump, didn’t he? The former footballer and his youngest with Victoria Beckham enjoyed the most adorable father-daughter trip to the Italian city, taking in the sights and tastes, from swanky soirees to gelato at 9am. We’ve said it once, we’ll say it twice – this truly is la dolce vita. And giving us all a coveted glimpse into their getaway, David, 48 – who also shares sons Brooklyn, 21, Romeo, 19, and Cruz, 17, with Victoria, 48 – shared a series of videos and posts that even has Posh Spice jealous. In his holiday photo album, David was seen beaming alongside Harper in one shot as she held up her gelato and Becks showed off a fan before they took to the famous canals for a gondola ride. Switching the slow pace of the gondola for something with some horsepower, the pair then got about on a water taxi, smiling for a couple of photos from the deck. He captioned the shot: ‘I mean come on,’ and we couldn’t agree more, David! Clearly Harper and David were on holiday time, when, as we all know, conventional mealtimes just do not exist, with David telling his millions of followers not to inform matriarch Victoria they were noshing ice cream for breakfast. In another sweet, literally, clip, the pair were musing about their early morning treats as well as Harper’s rather iconic hat which involved moving ears. Becks wrote: ‘Ssssssshhhhhhh don’t tell mummy 9am Gelato 🍨 sorry mummy @victoriabeckham ❤️ creating special memories with #HarperSeven 👒’ That one caught the attention of designer and former singer Victoria, who commented: ‘Did u bring mummy one of those hats home?!?! I love u both sooooo much!!! X special time with daddy is everything!!! X’ Ugh, we cannot stand the wholesomeness! David and Harper looked to be loving their time together in Italy, after they were seen attending an event at the Fenice theatre on Saturday night. They beamed as they headed into an event at the Fenice theatre, with Harper wearing a snazzy pink and purple ballgown, worth £1,600 from Aussie designer Zimmermann, while the former footballer was suited and booted in a dark jacket and trousers, with a pair of shades. While David was looking sharp, we have to give a special shoutout to Harper’s Nike trainers, for a spot of Lily Allen circa-2006 vibes. The pair were surrounded by a large entourage, which also included Domenico Dolce of fashion house Dolce and Gabbana, with everyone appearing to be in great spirits and laughing on their way into the event, which was situated on the beautiful canals of the city.
