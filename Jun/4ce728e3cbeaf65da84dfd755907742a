Two people have escaped with only minor injuries after a driver lost control of their car and slammed into a pub. The Fiat 500 was left wedged in the Birmingham boozer’s wall after the early-hours accident this morning. Both women in the car were taken to hospital but are not believed to have been seriously hurt. Pictures show the wall of Shannon’s pub in Bordesley Green demolished following the crash, which saw the vehicle smash through the plate glass window at around 12.30am. A cordon was in place around the building earlier today, with the red hatchback seemingly removed. West Midlands Fire Service’s Highgate crew, which tweeted photos of the scene, explained: ‘We often attend incidents where a slight change in circumstances such as direction or time, could’ve resulted in tragedy. ‘This #RTC (road traffic collision) in #BordesleyGreen today was one of those. ‘Luckily, the pub was closed and the two women from the car suffered only minor injuries.’ The fire service added that the car had hit a lamppost before careering into the pub, which was closed at the time. Fire bosses said there was no damage to the pub’s structural integrity, the building was made safe and the incident was left in the hands of West Midland Police just after 2am. Metro.co.uk has contacted the force for comment. A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman added that paramedics treated the two women at the scene, before they were taken to hospital. She explained: ‘We were called at 12.36am this morning to Bordesley Green, Birmingham, to reports of a car which had collided with a building. ‘Two paramedic officers and an ambulance attended the scene. ‘Two women were assessed and treated by ambulance staff for injuries not believed to be serious before being taken to hospital for further checks.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
