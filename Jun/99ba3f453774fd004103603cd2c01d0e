Love Island fans are increasingly certain that Gemma Owen and Jacques O’Neill will end up getting back together after they flirted in last night’s episode. Gemma is currently coupled up with Luca Bish, but things were shaken up when Jacques, who is Gemma’s ex-boyfriend, entered the villa as a bombshell. Meanwhile, Jacques is coupled up with Paige Thorne, but it’s clear there could still be some unfinished business between himself and Gemma. In Tuesday night’s show, Luca hugged Gemma… and accidentally called him Jacques, who was sitting directly next to them. The Freudian slip didn’t go unnoticed by the other contestants, with Amber Beckford pointing out: ‘Did you just call him something else?’ Eventually, the dust settled but Gemma and Jacques have continued to chat to each other on several occasions and Luca has struggled to keep his cool. In last night’s episode, the pair looked cosy as they had a conversation in another part of the villa. Islander Andrew Le Pace asked Luca: ‘You’re not bothered by that are you?’ with the fishmonger admitting it felt ‘a bit weird’. The pair had a conversation, where Gemma quizzed him on his current love life, as he revealed he was ‘seeing a girl for a bit’ but has been mainly single. You’re not a straight-forward person, and you don’t suit a straight-forward girl,’ she replied, smirking at him. Gemma added: ‘I feel like we need to move from this spot,’ as things became more flirtatious. Fans are convinced sparks will only continue to fly, as one took to Twitter to say: ‘In support of Gemma getting back with Jacques.’ ’Jacques and Gemma are getting back together, mark my words!!!! #LoveIslandUK #loveisland,’ another wrote. Last year’s finalist Chloe Burrows commented: ‘Luca gunna drive Gemma into Jacques bed #loveisland.’ ‘I’ve seen Jacques and Gemma together more than I’ve seen her and Luca together😵‍💫 #loveisland,’ a viewer added. It comes after fans were sure they spotted Gemma winking at her ex as he stripped down to just silver briefs in the Men-Chanics challenge on Tuesday. Taking to Twitter, one surprised fan wrote: ‘Are my eyes deceiving me or did Gemma wink at Jacques.’ Another viewer tweeted: ’No Gemma did not just give Jacques a cheeky wink.’ As things in the villa continue to spice up, could we see the exes decide they want to try their romance once more? Elsewhere, Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu left viewers in stitches last night after she literally crawled across the villa for a secret snog with newcomer Jay Younger. After going on a date with the investment analyst in scenes that aired this evening, it is clear there are sparks between the pair, much to the disappointment of her current partner Davide Sanclimenti. This also led to the Italian delivering what is possibly the most iconic line so far in the series, saying of Ekin-Su: ‘Play with Monopoly, not with me!’ We already can’t wait to see what happens next. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
