There’s a new cat in British politics, and he’s named after a former Labour prime minister. Sir Lindsay Hoyle has named his new pet kitten after Clement Attlee, who is best known for helping to create the welfare state and NHS in 1948. The Speaker of the House is known for his love of animals and his wide array of pets, which are all named after key figures from across the political spectrum. The naming of the four-month-old brown tabby Maine Coon means that Sir Lindsay has two pets named after Conservative politicians and two named after Labour MPs. The Hoyle family lost Patrick, a Maine Coon named after Tory peer Lord Patrick McComack, when the 12-year-old cat died from a tumour earlier this year. Sir Lindsay said even though he hadn’t been around long Attlee was already causing mischief. ‘Attlee is just the boldest, craziest, life-force you can imagine, he races around my office, much to the amusement of my team, and brings a smile to the face of doorkeepers, police officers, cleaners – and everyone who comes into contact with him,’ he said. ‘I still miss Patrick – who was my favourite pet – but Attlee, who we named after a former prime minister who created the NHS, has cheered us up no end.’ Sir Lindsay also owns a parrot named Boris, a Patterdale Terrier named Betty, and a tortoise named Maggie. An Instagram account has been created for Attlee which Sir Hoyle said he hopes will help to engage animal lovers with democracy. Attlee is not British Politics’ first or only cat, he joins Larry, Downing Street’s Chief Mouser and follows in the pawprints of Palmerston, the Foreign Office’s Chief Mouser who retired from Whitehall in 2020.
