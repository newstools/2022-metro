A man has been injured after he was shot at by someone with a nail gun as a car drove by. A hunt has been launched for the attacker, who was inside a vehicle driving in Carlisle, Cumbria on Saturday evening. They used the dangerous DIY tool at 6.15pm on Scotland Road while travelling in the direction of the city centre. The victim, in his 20s, thankfully only suffered minor harm. But witnesses have been asked to come forward as police warn the incident could have ended in tragedy. Acting inspector Sarah Hodkinson said: ‘We are appealing for anyone who was in the area who may have witnessed this incident to get in touch. ‘Fortunately, this did not result in a serious injury, however this does not in any way dilute the seriousness of this incident. ‘This sort of behaviour will not be tolerated and officers are making enquiries to identify those responsible.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
