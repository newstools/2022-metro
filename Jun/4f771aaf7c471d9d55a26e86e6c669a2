A woman made the discovery of a lifetime after bringing home a set of sofas from Craigslist and finding more than $36,000 (£28,700) inside a cushion. Vicky Umodu was browsing furniture on the online marketplace when she stumbled upon a free listing, featuring two sofas and matching chair. ‘I said, “Maybe it’s a gimmick. Let me call them,”’ Ms Umodu, from San Bernardino, California, told ABC7. But she learned it was a family who was getting rid of a late relative’s belongings. She said: ‘I just moved in, and I don’t have anything in my house. I was so excited, so we picked it up and brought it in.’ When she inspected the furniture’s condition at home, she noticed something odd – one of the cushions was very bulky. Initially thinking it could be a heat pad, Ms Umodu unzipped the cushion and found a stash of envelopes stuffed with thousands of dollars in cash. She said: ‘I was just telling my son, “Come, come, come!” I was screaming, “This is money! I need to call the guy!”’ Rather than keep it all to herself, she gave the money back right away, saying: ‘God has been kind to me and my children. They’re all alive and well. I have three beautiful grandchildren, so what can I ever ask from God?’ When she returned the money, the family told Ms Umodu there was cash hidden throughout the house. As a thank you, they gave Ms Umodu $2,200 to buy a new fridge – even though she was ‘not expecting a dime’. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
