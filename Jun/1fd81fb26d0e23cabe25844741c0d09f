A man claims he put cameras in a couple’s bedroom ‘to be close to them’ after they kindly invited him to stay during lockdown. Ryan Elson, 30, was living alone when the Covid pandemic forced Brits to isolate and not see anyone outside their household in 2020. But he was offered a room by the good-natured couple in April that year. In return, Elson offered to use his expertise in CCTV to make their house, in Denbighshire, North Wales, safer. Elson then took the opportunity to install cameras in the couple’s bedroom, their walk-in wardrobe and even their bedside alarm clock. The cameras were linked to apps on his phone, where he watched a live feed of the couple in private. At one point, Elson saw the woman getting undressed. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the court she felt ‘used and lied to’. She said: ‘(Elson) has taken complete advantage of the trusting nature of my family.’ She added the ordeal has left her ‘clinging’ to her mental health ‘with the tips of her fingers’. ‘It is physically exhausting to feel anxious every single day,’ she said. After being arrested in November 2020, Elson told police he installed the cameras because he was ‘anxious’ and ‘wanted to be close’ to the couple when they were apart. He later admitted voyeurism and observing a person doing a private act. Judge Nicola Saffman told Elson: ‘This was clearly a very unhealthy obsession. You were clearly obsessed with this family. ‘There was a clear bond of trust between you all. They took pity on you in lockdown, you were clearly struggling, and didn’t want to see you alone and isolated.’ She told him he abused this ‘loving, caring and considerate’ family’s trust ‘in the most dreadful way’. Elson was sentenced to 16 months in prison on Wednesday, but it was suspended for two years because of his confession. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
