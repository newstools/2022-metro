Get a slice of history, grandeur and fun in all one, with this unique property buy. A five-bedroom mansion has gone on the market for £525,000 in Grimsby, Lincolnshire – and it has its own ball pit room. A Victorian property, it has some modern additions to freshen up the space, such as a red-carpeted entrance hall and walk-in shower. Making the space feel even more grand, there’s a sprawling staircase. But that’s not all – there are even nods to retro styles, as one room features bright yellow walls and has a huge model dog. Yellow features in another room, too: the ball pit. Inside are multi-colored balls, foam finishes, and a green army net hanging from the ceiling. Children or adults, welcome. The Rightmove description reads: ‘Built circa 1890 and oozing opulence and charm, this superb family home has been sympathetically refurbished retaining many original charming features whist being upgraded with modern contemporary fittings of quality and style.’ Other rooms of the house include a library, kitchen, second lounge and five bathrooms. The rooms are light and airy, setting you up perfectly for a spacious walled garden, lined beautifully with trees. It’s a unique buy with plenty of character – and you’d impress any guests the moment you show off your balls. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
