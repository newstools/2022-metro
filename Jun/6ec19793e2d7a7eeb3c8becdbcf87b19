A real estate agent allegedly kidnapped a couple on a hiking trail and fastened a leash on the woman whom he had previously harassed. Kerry Endsley, 73, was spotted holding the husband and wife at gunpoint on a trail by a golf course in Lakewood, Colorado, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office. Endsley first pretended to tie his shoe before brandishing the gun, said a man who called 911 last Friday. ‘As they walked (past) him, he confronted them with a handgun,’ stated sheriff officials. ‘The suspect ordered the female to the ground and put a nylon leash around her neck.’ Endsley, who has sold high-end homes in the suburbs of Denver for Sotheby’s and Compass, had a history of harassing the woman he put on a leash, deputies said. The suspect allegedly demanded that the couple ‘come wit him’, but the husband was able to knock the gun out of his hands. The couple then fled and found deputies who were responding to the call. When deputies pulled their guns on Endsley, the real estate agent took out a stun gun and pointed it at the cops. The deputies fired at Endsley but missed. Another deputy then hit Endsley with a Taser. Endsley was transported to a hospital because he complained about being hurt from the stun gun. The wife and husband were not injured. Endsley has been charged with kidnapping, menacing and violating a restraining order that the woman had on him. He was booked into Jefferson County Jail where he remains held on a $500,000 bond. His court date has been set for Friday. Endsley was trying to get the woman to ‘drop charges’ against one of his relatives, a county spokeswoman told the Daily Mail. No details were provided on the relative’s identity or whether the case has been resolved. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
