Jill Dando may have been killed by a Russian mafia hitman who mistook her for another BBC journalist, according to documents submitted to a French court. Fashion mogul Gerald Marie, 72, who used to head the Elite modelling agency, is under investigation in relation to allegations of rape and sexual assault involving at least 11 women. They include Lisa Brinkworth, who claims he attacked her in 1998 while she was working alongside investigative journalist Donal MacIntyre to expose sex crimes in the fashion industry. Files submitted to the Paris prosecutor refer to a conversation overheard by ex-Elite executive Omar Harfouch in which Marie is alleged to have ordered a member of the Russian mafia to ‘deal with a problem’, the Daily Mail reports. The documents from French law firm Bourdon Associes add: ‘Shortly thereafter… a BBC journalist, Jill Dando, was shot dead in April 1999. ‘Indeed, these two journalists were in their thirties, were blonde with the same facial features, of the same height and of similar stature. They lived close to each other and had people in common, including the husband of Jill Dando.’ The lawyers note in the paperwork that Ms Dando’s fiancé, Alan Farthing, was Ms Brinkworth’s doctor, the newspaper reports. Ms Dando, then one of the BBC’s highest-profile stars, was shot outside her home in Fulham, west London, on April 26, 1999. It remains one of the UK’s most infamous unsolved cases of the last 20 years. Barry George, from Fulham, was initially convicted of her murder in July 2001 but was later acquitted at a retrial in August 2008. The Mail reports that the evidence has been passed to Scotland Yard.
