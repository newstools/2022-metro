Love Island has revealed Gemma Owen’s ex-boyfriend, who is believed to be rugby player Jacques O’Neill, will be entering the villa on Sunday night. The ITV2 show aired its first recoupling on Friday night, after the shock exit of Liam Llewellyn. Most couples stayed the same, but Davide Sanclimenti and Gemma Owen both ended up in new pairings, with Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu and Luca Bish respectively. This meant both Paige Thorne and Afia Tonkmor were left single but were allowed to remain in the villa after Liam’s departure. But what the Islanders didn’t know at that point, was a new boy was about to be sent in to stir things up, who already knows someone very well indeed. While narrator Iain Stirling didn’t reveal the name of the latest bombshell, viewers could see his entrance, and hear Gemma reveal: ‘Oh my God, that’s my ex-boyfriend.’ He is believed to be Castleford Tigers player Jacques, with the club having released a statement which timed very well with the end of tonight’s episode. On their Twitter account, a statement said: ‘Castleford Tigers can confirm that the Club has agreed to release Jacques O’Neill from his contract to allow him to pursue another opportunity. Best of luck @Jacques9oneill !’ Viewers, of course, were loving the impending sense of chaos. One wrote: ‘“That’s my ex boyfriend” 🤣guys LOVE ISLAND HAS BEGUN ! #loveisland’ ‘I hope Paige cracks on with Gemmas ex boyfriend #LoveIsland karma’s a b***h,’ remarked another. Someone else said: ‘EX BOYFRIEND???!!!!!! LOVE ISLAND UNDERSTOOD THE ASSIGNMENT!! #LoveIsland.’ Tonight’s episode saw Gemma enjoying a new flirtation with Luca, much to Davide’s annoyance. When Luca eventually decided to pick Gemma, it left his current other half Paige single and vulnerable, along with Afia. Paige received a text to give the verdict on their future on the island. It read: ‘Afia and Paige you are now single. As Liam left the villa earlier today. No other islanders will be leaving tonight #stillinthegame.’ The pair were able to breathe a sigh of relief and hugged their fellow contestants. But will either of them manage to catch the newbie’s eye, or will they both end up waving goodbye to the villa? Metro.co.uk has reached out to ITV for comment. Love Island continues on Sunday at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
