Fish and Chips is a staple dish loved by people up and down the country. But one chippy in Glasgow is turning the renowned supper on its head by covering a it in 24 karat gold. Eating such an extravagant meal will cost you £80, but still throngs of people have been crowding outside the shop to try it. The dish at Enzo’s takeaway includes tartar sauce, lemon, and mushy peas – all coated in the edible bling. There is also the option for golden pickled onion, sausage or scampi, for people out there who are not fans of your traditional fish. Enzo’s owner, 43-year-old Sooraj Alanal, says he is not stopping at just golden fish. He even has plans for black pudding and haggis coated in edible gold leaf, and hopes the price can be brought down when the menu is expanded. Mr Alanal said: ‘I was wanting to do something luxury and that’s why we came up with it. ‘We came up with the idea as there are gold leaf steaks. We are serving fish and chips or sausage, pickled onion, lemon, mushy peas, tartar sauce, or scampi supper with gold. ‘We are bringing in a big menu with things like haggis and black pudding. We are trying to make it so everyone can have it. ‘I was trying to buy it in bulk to bring down the cost. Everyone is coming to us. ‘We are going to do bulk production soon. I’m sourcing the gold leaf from the manufacturers. ‘It comes in foil, you take it out of the foil and put it on the fish or sausage. It’s £80 at the moment because the gold is expensive.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
