Looking for ways to get your house smelling super fresh? Well, lifestyle influencer and author Chantel Mila, aka Mama Mila, has shared not one, not two but three very easy hacks on social media that she says will make your home smell fantastic. For the mum’s first tip, you need a heatproof bowl, coffee grounds or beans, and a tea light. Place the coffee in the bowl and nestle the tea light in there. Chantel explained in her post that the candle’s warmth releases the smell of the coffee so that it fills your house. ‘As with any candle,’ she added, ‘never leave unattended.’ Her next hack involves baking soda – everyone’s favourite multi-use cleaner and deodoriser – and a lemon. By sprinkling the latter on half of the former, you can use it to give your sink a good, fresh-smelling clean. Her third and final hack incorporates baking soda and your favourite essential oil. Chantel wrote that all you have to do is put 10 drops of the oil in half a cup of baking soda. Then sprinkle that fragrant powder on your carpet, leave it for an hour and vacuum it up. That should solve any carpet odour issues – just check your vacuum’s manual first to double-check it’s safe to use on fine particles. And there you have it – your home should be smelling heavenly right about now. Do you have a story to share?
