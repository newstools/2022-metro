Tamara Korpatsch has labelled her doubles partner Harmony Tan ‘unprofessional’ in a furious rant after the latter withdrew from the doubles after her shock win over Serena Williams at Wimbledon. World No.115 and Wimbledon debutant Tan stunned the tennis world with a remarkable 7-5 1-6 7-6 first-round victory over 23-time major champion Williams on Tuesday night. Not everyone was lauding Tan following her result, though, with Korpatsch upset at her late withdrawal from their scheduled first-round doubles match against Raluca Olaru and Nadiia Kichenok on Wednesday, with the French player citing a thigh injury. ‘Unfortunately my doubles partner Harmony Tan retried from our doubles today,’ Korpatsch said. ‘She just texted me this morning. ‘Let me wait here one hour before the match starts. I’m very sad, disappointed and also very angry that I can’t play my first doubles Grand Slam. ‘It’s really not fair for me. I didn’t deserve that. She asked me before the tournament if we wanna play doubles and I said yes, I didn’t ask her, she asked me. ‘If you’re broken after a three-hour match the day before, you can’t play professional. That’s my opinion.’ Tan paid tribute to ‘superstar’ Williams after knocking one of her childhood heroes out of Wimbledon on Tuesday. ‘I’m so emotional now. [Serena] is a superstar and when I was young I was watching her so many times on the TV,’ she said after the match. ‘For my first Wimbledon, it’s wow. Just wow. When I saw the draw I was really scared. ‘I would like to thank everybody and my team and my coach Natalie Tauziat, who also played Serena. Thank you so much for being with me.’ MORE : Ukraine tennis star dons blue and yellow ribbon as Wimbledon relaxes dress code MORE : Novak Djokovic hits out at US Open chiefs over vaccination stance For more stories like this, check our sport page.
