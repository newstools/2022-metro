Shoppers in Primark were horrified when a newborn baby reportedly fell down an escalator from the top and began screaming. Staff rushed to help during the incident on June 20 in Romford, east London. It is not clear whether the baby was injured, or how seriously. One customer who was there at the time wrote on the Facebook group Barking and Dagenham Community Page: ‘A baby fell down from the top of the escalator in Romford Primark yesterday does anybody that was there know if the baby was alright or not as I can’t seem to get the poor baby’s scream out my mind.’ My London, who initially reported the story, said that one user replied claiming to know a worker in the store, who said the baby was ‘only two weeks old’. Another wrote: ‘I do hope the poor baby is okay. It’s difficult to control toddlers sometimes, but a baby? The parents must be devastated.’ A Primark spokesperson said: ‘We are aware of an incident that occurred in our Romford store on Monday. ‘Our colleagues were on hand to provide assistance and support. ‘We hope that the baby and the family are doing well.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
