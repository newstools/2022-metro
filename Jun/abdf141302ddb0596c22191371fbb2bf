A California property that Johnny Cash used to call home is now up for sale. The 4,500 sq ft home in Casitas Springs – which the country singer shared with his first wife Vivian Liberto – is on the market at £1.4million. Located in the hills between Ventura and Ojai, the stunning home has a lot to offer, including six private acres, a swimming pool and a BBQ area. But perhaps the biggest selling point is the singer’s wood-panelled recording studio that remains inside – the spot where the artist spent countless hours creating his music. It’s thought the artist built the impressive home back in 1961, as an escape from his busy lifestyle. Other notable features include painted ceilings with a touch of glitter, an original wall-mounted turntable and intercom system, and curved brick fireplace in the family room. The kitchen also features dark wooden cabinets – in-keeping with the country lodge-look that the singer favoured. Johnny’s famous black commode also remains intact within the house. There’s no denying it’s a listing dripping in music history – especially as locals recall stories of Johnny setting up speakers on the hillside, outside the house, and playing concerts for the townspeople down below. The double-gabled house is listed with Douglas Elliman Realty. Shall we take a look around? Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
