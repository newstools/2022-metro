Tributes have poured in for a 15-year-old boy who died trying to save his mum from a knife attack. Jakub Szymansk has been praised as a ‘hero’ who died ‘fighting for his family’ following the vicious assault at a house in Manchester. He was treated at the scene for stab wounds at around 9.30pm on Thursday before being rushed to hospital, where he died an hour later. His mum, Katarzyna Bastek, was also left badly injured from the ferocious attack but is now in a stable condition in hospital. Yesterday evening police in Kent arrested a 44-year-old man on suspicion of murder – 250 miles away from the scene. Paying tribute to Jakub, one friend told the Manchester Evening News: ‘There’s not a chance that boy isn’t a hero. Everyone here knew him for being kind and respectful. ‘He was quiet, but he was a protector. He fought for his family. He was an amazing person, he was a hero and he should be remembered as one.’ Detective Chief Inspector Alicia Smith, said: ‘This attack has left a community reeling and a family coming to terms with what was an absolutely devastating incident for everyone involved. ‘A teenage boy who had his whole life ahead of him has tragically lost his life and not only is his mother grieving at the loss of her son, but she is also recovering from what will have been no doubt, hugely traumatic. ‘Our thoughts remain very much with the family and we are absolutely committed to establishing what exactly happened last night. ‘Detectives have been working around the clock since this incident was first reported to us and we’ve now made an arrest which is a huge step forward in getting the family the answers they need. ‘Our enquiries are on-going and we would still like to hear from anyone with information, or anyone who may have seen anything.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
