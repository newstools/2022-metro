Manchester United and Barcelona are on the brink of a £68million agreement for the transfer of Frenkie de Jong. The Netherlands international has been put up for sale by the Catalans, who are desperate to raise funds before they settle their annual accounts at the end of the month. Despite Barcelona’s willingness to sell, the Catalans have driven a hard bargain by demanding in excess of £72m for De Jong – which is what they paid for the 25-year-old three years ago. United have been keen to agree a deal that reflects Barcelona’s willingness to sell, while the new power structure at the club feel it is important to kick off a new era at the club with a statement transfer. And, after weeks of negotiations, the Mirror claim that United have made a breakthrough and are on the brink of agreeing a £68m deal. The deal will include £13m of achievable add-ons, with United paying £55m upfront. Once De Jong is through the door, United will seek to complete a deal for Christian Eriksen when he becomes a free agent on July 1st. The Dane has an offer to remain at Brentford and he is considering doing so as his family are settled in London.
