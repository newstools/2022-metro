Princess Eugenie’s one-year-old son looked precious today as he attended a parade to mark his great-grandmother’s 70 years on the British throne. August, whose father is Jack Brooksbank, has been pictured on Instagram, but has never attended an official royal engagement before. He was seen wearing a jumper with a Union flag on the front as he bounced on his mother’s knee during the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee Pageant on Sunday. Meanwhile, Princess Beatrice’s stepson, 6, was also spotted at a royal event for the first time. Christopher Woolf Mapelli Mozzi, or Wolfie, is the son of Beatrice’s husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi and his ex, Dara Huang. He served as his father’s best man at his royal wedding to Beatrice back in July 2020. The couple previously named him ‘the best big brother’ to their daughter Sienna. Sienna, who is just eight months old, is thought to have stayed at home today. A photo of the little girl, who is eleventh in line to the British throne, is yet to be shared. Other royal children were out in full force this weekend – including future King Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Their little brother Prince Louis, 4, stole the show not once but twice though – with silly faces that suggested he didn’t appreciate Platinum Jubilee events as much as others. The Cambridge’s youngest son shared a sweet moment with his grandpa Prince Charles today as he was rocked from side to side while sitting on his lap. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s children weren’t seen in public, with the Sussexes keeping a low profile while visiting. It’s believed they left the UK before the Platinum Jubilee ended.
