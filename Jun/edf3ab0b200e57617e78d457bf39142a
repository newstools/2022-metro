Madonna has shared her latest round of raunchy snaps on Instagram, just weeks after being blocked by the platform from going live due to ‘going against our community guidelines’. The 63-year-old pop icon, who has been enjoying the habit of sharing pictures of herself wearing as much or as little as she pleases on her social media, posted pictures of herself in underwear, stockings, and a robe on Friday. The Frozen singer, who recently broke up with her 28-year-old boyfriend, Ahlamalik Williams, wore her long blonde hair in double plaits and sported sunglasses for the indoor shoot, showed off snaps of herself posing on a bed, with a patterned Versace robe on over black underwear, stockings and vertiginous heels. The series of pictures saw her lie across the bed as well as pose for the camera with her knees up. In the caption of the photos, she wrote: ‘Jet-lag…………..✈️💀🤍’ Plenty of her followers were fans of the images, with Kanye West’s whirlwind ex Julia Fox leaving a row of heart-eyed emojis before commenting: ‘Come to New York!!!’ There were also plenty of fire emojis to be seen, as one follower shared: ‘One thing I love about Madonna is she going to live her best life and not care what haters have to say.’ However, the photos appeared to rile up rapper 50 Cent once more, who had previously had an online spat with Madge last year over similar photos. Sharing the first picture of the music star from her upload on Instagram, he wrote: ‘I hope she didn’t make her kids take this picture. LOL at 63 somebody tell her to chill out please.’ The actor and entrepreneur – real name Curtis Jackson – also appeared to shade her by adding pictures of aliens to the rest of his post. Previously, Madonna had blasted 50 Cent for his ‘fake apology’ over mocking her racy snaps last December, calling it ‘bulls**t’. Madonna had uploaded a series of images to Instagram in November of herself posing on a bed dressed in lingerie and fishnet tights, while also flashing a nipple in a couple of the snaps. The rapper had reacted the first time by posting an array of memes and jokes about her photoshoot to his Instagram page, but after she called him out for ‘pretending to be her friend’ and then making fun of her, he apologised. Well, he acknowledged that he ‘must have hurt Madonna’s feelings’ as she had ‘dug up’ a photo of them from 2003 to prove they were friends. He went on to say he hoped she accepted his apology but has since deleted the tweet. Madge’s lengthy video response including her saying she ‘forgave’ the rapper, but also called out his apology for ‘not being valid’, as she called on him to apologise for ‘your misogynistic, sexist, ageist behaviour and remarks’ rather than for hurting her feelings. She also accused the rapper of ‘trying to put a limit on when women should be able to feel good about themselves’. Got a story?
