Paulo Dybala is ‘happy’ in Italy but has opened the door to playing in other leagues amid interest from clubs across Europe. The 28-year-old will depart from Juventus when his contract expires at the end of June, bringing an end to a successful seven-year spell in Turin. Dybala has been linked with many European sides, including Premier League outfits Arsenal, Manchester United, and Tottenham. Meanwhile, Juventus’ Serie A rivals Inter Milan have also been credited with an interest in signing the Argentina international on a free transfer. On his future, Dybala told ESPN: ‘I am quite calm, the people who work with are taking care,’ ‘In Italy I am very comfortable. I would still like to know other leagues like Premier, Liga… but I’m happy in Italy.’ Inter vice-president Javier Zanetti has spoken out on the prospect of Dybala linking up with Lautaro Martinez at San Siro. The Argentine forwards both scored in the 2022 Finalissima on Wednesday night as Lionel Scaloni’s side beat Italy at Wembley to claim the trophy. On the prospect of pairing Martinez with Dybala, Zanetti said: ‘Maybe. The transfer market is opening, we have a lot of time – we’re a club who must seize opportunities, if that proves to be the case we’ll evaluate it. ‘We must also be realistic, the constraints we’re dealing with are ones you know, but we’re talking about a great player when it comes to Dybala.’ MORE : Arsenal closing in on £21.75m move for Bologna defender Aaron Hickey MORE : Jesse Lingard pens emotional message as Manchester United exit confirmed For more stories like this, check our sport page.
