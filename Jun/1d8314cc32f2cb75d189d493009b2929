A Nigerian politician has been charged with his alleged role in an organ harvesting conspiracy. He is accused of arranging for a child to be brought to the UK to have their organs removed against their will. Ike Ekweremadu, a district senator and lawyer from Nigeria, is charged with conspiracy to arrange/facilitate travel of another person with a view to exploitation. The 60-year-old is being held in custody and is due to appear at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court later today. His wife Beatrice Ekweremadu, 55, has also been charged with the same offence. The child – whose age in unknown – has been taken into care.
