Coleen Rooney and husband Wayne Rooney celebrated 14 years of marriage in style, by dancing the night away at Ed Sheeran’s Manchester gig. The couple marked the milestone after a tense court showdown with Rebekah Vardy and her husband Jamie Vardy, following claims that the fellow footballer’s wife leaked stories about Coleen to the press. Their trial came to a close last month but a verdict is yet to be announced, with Coleen and Wayne jetting off to Dubai for some sun without attending the final day. Coleen and Wayne have kept a relatively low profile following the trial, but were seen up north at the fancy Dakota hotel, leaving on Sunday morning after living it up at the Bad Habits hitmaker’s concert. Pictured for the first time since returning to the UK, Coleen cut a casual figure in denim shorts, showing off her fresh tan but still wearing her medical boot, which she wore to court. As for husband Wayne, he looked typically sporty in a blue tracksuit and matching cap. TV presenter Coleen took to social media to express her love for the former professional footballer on their special day, sharing a smiley snap from warmer climates. Posting the loved up pic on Twitter, she wrote: ’14 years…12.06.08′, accompanied by wedding emoji. Of course, the famous pair met with Ed himself backstage after his gig at the Etihad Stadium finished, with Coleen sharing on Instagram that he was ‘amazing as always’, accompanying a group photo in which the songwriter posed with a cheeky thumbs up. Wayne also posed a snap with the Shivers singer, captioning it: ‘Ed Sheeran….class as always. Brilliant concert. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼’. Coleen and Wayne are childhood sweethearts who met at school and tied the knot in a dreamy ceremony in Portofino, Italy in 2008. They had both a civil and church ceremony, with the wedding thought to have cost an eye-watering £5million. The special occasion included not one, not two, but three dresses for author Coleen, and a champagne reception at Villa Durazzo, where they celebrated until 4am. They now share four sons, Kai, 12, Klay, nine, Kit, six, and Cass, four. While there was a £50,000 firework display at the couple’s wedding 14 years ago, they’ve endured some fireworks of their own over recent months thanks to their highly-publicised legal woes. As it stands, Rebekah Vardy denies being the person to sell stories on her former friend to the press, after Coleen performed a months-long sting operation to suss out the identity of the mole. A verdict in what has been dubbed the Wagatha Christie case (never gets old) is expected at a later date. Got a story?
