An 82-year-old woman says her holiday was ruined when she returned home to a badly damaged car. Madeleine Tretton used an unofficial meet and greet service she later discovered is registered to a field near Manchester Airport. She landed at 10pm on March 10 after a holiday in Gran Canaria and was looking forward to getting home to Lytham, Lancashire. However, she ended up waiting for three hours for the car to be returned. When it finally arrived she said damage to the underside, axel and shock absorbers made the car undriveable. Madeline said it was also covered in mud, inside and out. She said: ‘I contacted [the firm] and they said they were investigating, but then ignored my calls and e-mails. ‘I read on Trustpilot they had 74% poor reviews but by then it was too late.’ The repairs cost £700 and she was without a car for four weeks while parts were sourced. She said: ‘The car is still not right, one of the wheels rattles when I drive, I am so disappointed by the way the company handled my complaint and we even have video evidence of the car at Terminal 1 with the damage but the company continue to ignore us.’ She has now filed to small claims for the damage done to her car. She added: ‘Use the official Manchester Airport Meet and Greet, not the fake one posing as Manchester Airport.’ An airport spokesman said: ‘We encourage customers to use initiatives such as Park Mark and the Government-backed “buy with confidence” scheme to find an operator that has undergone a series of detailed checks.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
