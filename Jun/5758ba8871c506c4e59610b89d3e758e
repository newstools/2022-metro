Detectives have arrested a man over a brutal attack on a Polish migrant who’d only been in London for an hour. Kamil Sobala, 31, was assaulted outside a pub near Victoria Coach Station on the evening of Saturday, June 18, after asking for directions. He claims two men swore, asked where he was from, then proceded to beat him after he said he was from Poland. Kamil was knocked unconcious and was left with blood streaming down his face before being taken to hospital for treatment. Yesterday evening a 33-year-old man handed himself in at a west London police station. He was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm and was subsequently released under investigation. The Metropolitan Police said that while the victim is Polish, the incident is not currently being treated as a hate crime. Kamil previously told how he used to live in the UK in 2013, and after returning to his home country for a while, decided to move back to London with friends. He says he arrived at Victoria Station to meet them at a pub when he asked for directions as his phone had died. Following the assault at 7.50pm on Elizabeth Street, Kamil says he was ‘shaken’ by the experiene and had turned to drinking to ‘stop the pain’. He added: ‘It’s terrible. I’m just scared of going to the shop I can’t sleep and I’m scared as well as full of pain. ‘They punched me until I couldn’t remember anything.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
