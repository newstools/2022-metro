Barking is very normal behaviour for dogs and puppies, but that doesn’t exactly make it nice. Training puppies out of constantly barking is key, both for your sake and the sake of your neighbours. That’s why Lorna Winter, director of the UK Dog Behaviour and Training Charter and co-founder and head of training at Zigzag, has shared her tips on how to get your pup out of that noisy habit. Don’t tell your puppy off for doing something that comes so naturally to them – they don’t know it’s naughty after all. ‘Don’t punish barking as it is one of the limited means of communication your puppy has with you and the world,’ says Lorna. Instead, opt for positive reinforcement over negative. ‘Heavily reward periods of quiet behaviour,’ says Lorna, ‘especially with more vocal pups.’ Your pup might be feeling vocal because they’re under-stimulated. ‘Barking is very often a symptom of boredom and frustration, says Lorna. ‘So try to figure out what it is your puppy is needing.’ You can also try to channel the barking into something constructive like specific commands. Lorna explains: ‘Teach “speak” and “quiet” on cue, so you have some control over barking.’ Do you have a story to share?
