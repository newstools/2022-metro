A former soldier stabbed a young married couple to death in their home while their children slept upstairs using the ceremonial dagger given to him when he left the Army, a court has heard. Collin Reeves, 35, denies murdering next-door neighbours Stephen and Jennifer Chapple in Dragon Rise, Norton Fitzwarren, near Taunton in Somerset, on the evening of November 21. Following his arrest, Reeves, who was a commando engineer with the British Army, told police: ‘I was just doing my job – it was an operation.’ Jurors at Bristol Crown Court were told he has admitted killing the couple and has pleaded guilty to their manslaughter. He claims he was suffering an ‘abnormality of mental functioning’, and jurors were told it will be their job to decide whether this was true. The court heard Reeves had been involved in a long-running dispute with the couple over designated parking on the new-build housing development. On the night of the killings, he climbed the fence separating their gardens and crept in through the back door. He then stabbed both of them ‘multiple times’ in the living room in what was described as a frenzied attack lasting barely a minute. The jury at Bristol Crown Court was shown a clip from the Chapples’ back door camera of Reeves climbing their fence and entering via the back door. A few seconds later Mrs Chapple can be heard screaming in terror, with Reeves shouting ‘die you f****** die’. The clip was so distressing that many of the victims’ family members chose to leave court before it was played. Mrs Chapple, 33, suffered six stab wounds to her upper chest and shoulder, causing fatal injuries to a major blood vessel and her heart, prosecutor Adam Feest QC said. She did not even have a chance to stand up from the sofa to defend herself, he added. Mr Chapple, 36, was found close to the rear door and had also suffered six stab wounds as well as three other minor injuries. Neither had any defensive injuries, Mr Feest said, indicating the speed of the attack. After the killings, Reeves climbed back over the fence and telephoned the police to tell them he had stabbed his neighbours. Just a few days before the attack, Mrs Chapple was the victim of a ‘particularly unpleasant verbal assault’ by Reeves, Mr Feest said, captured on the victims’ Ring Doorbell camera. Sandrine Moreira, who worked with Mrs Chapple in the coffee shop of a nearby garden centre, said on Wednesday the victim had been ‘very scared’ of Reeves. The witness said: ‘(Mrs Chapple) was very scared, she was very afraid. ‘She knew (Reeves) would kill her if she would say or do anything against him, she knew he was ex-military.’ Ms Moreira described an incident in which Reeves had brought his two daughters into the coffee shop and adjusted his chair so he could stare at the counter where Mrs Chapple was working. ‘The chair was turned sideways to face us at the counter and he just sat there looking at us, that was pretty much it,’ Ms Moreira said. Various friends and neighbours gave witness statements about how scared Mrs Chapple was of the defendant, including becoming anxious about the school run because she did not want to be alone. Mrs Chapple also told several people she wanted to move house to get away from Reeves. The jury was shown a clip of Reeves approaching Mrs Chapple outside her house on November 11 following an earlier exchange between the victim and Reeves’ wife Kayley Reeves. He accused Mrs Chapple of ‘f***ing gobbing off you cheeky little bitch’. The victim replies ,‘she’s the one who started it, just f*** off’ to which he responds, ‘what’s that you f****** c***, you fat bitch, you f****** … f****** c***’. Mr Feest said: ‘The rights and wrongs of (the dispute) may matter not a jot, but it is clear that it was a source of stress that affected both families.’ Reeves had also been suffering problems in his own marriage, the jury was told. As well as the dispute over parking, on the evening of the killings, Mrs Reeves had told her husband that she wanted a trial separation. A recording device in their bedroom captures Mrs Reeves apparently saying, ‘There’s only so many years I can take your shit’, the jury heard. Mrs Reeves told police that in response he went downstairs, then came back upstairs, before descending again and then going outside. ‘It was at this point that she heard screaming,’ Mr Feest said. Mrs Reeves called her mother and father-in-law when she noticed that the ceremonial dagger was missing from the picture frame in which it was usually displayed alongside photographs of Reeves’ time in the army. Mr Feest said: ‘Whether it was this parking dispute, tensions within the defendant’s marriage, or a combination of these things which led the defendant to kill his neighbours is unclear. ‘When he was questioned by the police in interview about his actions, the defendant chose to exercise his right to silence.’ The jury was told it will hear evidence from two psychiatrists about Reeves’ mental state. The trial, which is expected to last for eight days, continues. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
