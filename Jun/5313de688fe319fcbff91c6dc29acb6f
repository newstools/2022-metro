A young woman was saved from a hostage situation after sending a note in her Grubhub delivery order to call the police. In a seemingly frantic note sent to a nearby restaurant, the 24-year-old victim asked the business to discreetly alert authorities to the fact that she was in danger. ‘Please call the police his going to call me when u delivered come with the cones please don’t make it obvious,’ the woman wrote in the ‘Additional Instructions’ section while placing an order at The Chipper Truck Café, a restaurant in Yonkers, a suburb north of New York City. Staff at the restaurant received the alarming order around 5am Sunday morning and called the police, restaurant owner Alice Bermejo told CBS 2. The 24-year-old woman who left the note had reportedly been raped at knifepoint by a man she met on a dating app, according to police. Officers responded to the address after receiving the 911 call and arrested the man. Workers at the café didn’t know what had happened until the next day, when a woman called the restaurant and thanked them for their help. ‘I’ve often heard of this happening but never thought it would happen to us. Thankfully we were open and able to help her,’ the café said in a Facebook post. ‘A big thank you to the police for their fast response,’ the owners added in the post. The New York City Police Department arrested 32-year-old Kemoy Royal around 6.20am Sunday. He was charged with rape, strangulation, criminal sex act, unlawful imprisonment, menacing, assault, criminal possession of a weapon and sexual abuse. According to police, Royal has also been accused of another rape on June 15. In an announcement Wednesday, Grubhub said it was giving the café $5,000 for their ‘simple but extraordinary’ help during a crisis.
