Love Island’s Iain Stirling couldn’t resist opening the show with a remark at the expense of former Conservative MP Neil Parish, who resigned after being caught watching porn at the House of Commons. Tonight saw Iain back in his role of narrator as his wife Laura Whitmore took on the presenting gig once again. But just moments into the programme, Iain incorporated the scandal from Mr Parish into his commentary as he introduced the swanky new villa to fans. He began: ‘Yes, we are back and the big news is, we’ve got a new villa. Incredibly, we managed to find one that’s got 57 cameras and a giant communal bedroom. ‘I’ve no idea what this place was used for before but I looked into a draw and found handcuffs, lube and a copy of Tractors Monthly marked “Property of the House of Commons.” Mr Parish famously claimed he was looking for tractors after he was spotted viewing X-rated material by colleagues. At the time, friends of the Devon MP said the farmer was looking for a brand of combine harvester called a ‘Dominator’ when he ended up on an adult website. He was suspended from the party pending an investigation, but days later resigned from his role. Of course, fans of the programme quickly praised Iain’s commentary, as they reacted to the remark. One shared: ‘Iain Stirling doing a politics related joke like 2 mins into the series is content we love to see #LoveIsland.’ Another Twitter user said: ‘I’ve actually missed Iain taking the p**s 👏🏻 #LoveIsland.’ ‘Can Iain Stirling announce the confidence vote when it comes in #LoveIsland,’ asked a viewer. ‘#LoveIsland kicking off with criticisms of the Tories, I’m so excited,’ someone else shared. Iain has been commentating on the series since it started and is a firm favourite of fans. He loves to take a swipe or two in his role, and recently tore into rival dating shows during a trailer for the series, like First Dates and Celebs Go Dating. One part of the video shows shows two animated figures kissing over a selection of pool floats which spell out ‘The OGs of love,’ while a second moment shows a foot smashing a TV with ‘Naked celebs go dating on a beach,’ before the flag reading ‘Love, we own it’ appears. Love Island continues tomorrow night at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
