Love Island fans think they’ve rumbled why Gemma Owen and Luca Bish erupt into a huge row in tonight’s episode, and, obviously, it involves her ex Jacques O’Neill. Since Jacques entered the villa, Luca has understandably been on edge and in a preview of tonight’s episode it clearly comes to a head. Gemma, 19, and Luca, 23, have been coupled up since he pinched Michael Owen’s daughter from rival Davide Sanclimenti, 27. However, it hasn’t exactly been smooth sailing since and tonight Gemma snaps at Luca. ‘Don’t roll your eyes at me and be a pr*ck,’ Gemma hisses. ‘It was a genuine mistake, I’m sorry, there’s nothing more to it.’ As it stands, we’ll have to wait and find out what the catalyst behind the drama is but fans think they’ve got it all worked out. ‘Gemma has 10000% called Luca by Jacques name or some s**t. petty but i’m ready for it,’ speculated one audience member, which was echoed by others who agreed with someone else adding: ‘That’s what I think!’ ‘I reckon Gemma has called gone to say Lucas name and said Jacques instead,’ tweeted a third. Whatever the cause, Gemma and Luca’s row looks intense and, quite honestly, we’re all ready for it. Not that Luca needs to worry after Jacques coupled up with Paige Throne, does he? Hmmm…. Love Island continues tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
