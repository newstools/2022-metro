Manchester United have submitted an offer to Christian Eriksen, according to reports. Ten Hag has made Eriksen one of his priority transfer targets this summer alongside Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong. The Denmark international is currently available on a free transfer as his short-term contract with Brentford expires at the end of June. And according to The Times, United have made a move and have offered Eriksen a deal to join Old Trafford. It’s claimed that United are hopeful that Ten Hag’s positive relationship with Eriksen could help secure a deal. However, The Guardian report that Eriksen’s preference is to either return to Spurs or sign a new deal with Brentford. The report claims that United are not panicking and are now planning a second bid for De Jong as they want the Netherlands international to be part of the club’s pre-season tour. Eriksen spent seven seasons at Spurs, while he also played under Antonio Conte at Inter during their Serie A-winning campaign. Speaking about his future last week, Eriksen insisted that he will take his time over deciding his next move. ‘There are many criteria and many different things inside such a decision. Sometimes it goes fast in football, other times a little slower,’ Eriksen said whilst on international duty with Denmark. ‘You are not in control of it yourself. I have to make the best decision and not rush anything through. ‘My phone stays on, but I also know my agent well enough to know that he only calls if there’s something exciting.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
