Former world champion boxer David Haye appeared in court today charged with assault after allegedly attacking another man at a London gig. The 41-year-old is accused of attacking Nickesh Jhala at the Hammersmith Apollo in west London in October 2021. Haye, one of Britain’s most successful boxers, appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Friday, confirming his name and date of birth and entering a not guilty plea. District judge Annabel Pilling granted Haye bail, with the trial set for September 9. Haye retired from boxing in 2018, having enjoyed an impressive professional career, winning multiple world championship titles in two different weight classes. The Londoner appeared in the Westminster Magistrates’ Court dock wearing an orange and brown jacket and dark jeans, with his hands cuffed behind his back. The alleged victim, the police officer investigating the case and three other witnesses are due to give evidence during the one-day trial later this year. District judge Pilling warned Haye to turn up for his trial or he could be jailed, telling the defendant: ‘You have been charged and pleaded not guilty so there obviously will be a trial. ‘I’m going to grant you bail with no conditions, but you need to be back here for the trial or you can be fined or sent to prison. ‘A warrant could be issued for your arrest and the trial could go ahead in your absence and you wouldn’t be able to give your version of events.’ Haye began his professional career in 2002 and finished with a record of 28 wins from 32 fights. He beat entrepreneur-turned-boxer Joe Fournier in an exhibition event last September and then called out world champion Tyson Fury. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
