The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have released a new image of daughter Lilibet after celebrating her first birthday on Saturday. The little one marked her big day with a party at Frogmore Cottage after travelling to the UK with her parents and brother Archie for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. Close family and friends were invited to celebrate the occasion at the Windsor residence. A spokesperson for the couple did not name specific people who attended, amid reports there is still tension between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and some members of the Royal Family. But it’s believed that Lilibet, who is named in honour of the Queen, met Her Majesty for the first time during their trip. The ‘candid and spontaneous’ new picture was taken by family friend Misan Harriman at an intimate picnic at the weekend, it’s understood. Mr Harriman shared a black and white snap of Meghan holding Lilibet on Twitter, alongside the words: ‘It was such a privilege to celebrate the 1st birthday of Lilibet with my family and hers! Joy and face painting all around.’ A cake by the royal couple’s wedding baker Claire Ptak was served up at the bash. The Sussexes said they were ‘incredibly touched’ by the birthday wishes that have flooded in for their daughter. Donations amounting to over £79,000 were made in Lilibet’s honour to the World Central Kitchen, a not-for-profit organisation partnered with the couple’s Archewell foundation. The organisation has provided support in Uvalde, Texas and Ukraine, a spokesperson for Harry and Meghan said. The couple kept a low profile this weekend, appearing at just one royal event for the jubilee. Photos this morning showed their plane touching down in California after their fleeting visit to London.
