Iain Stirling provided more brutal commentary on tonight’s Love Island as he couldn’t resist a swipe at the expense of Downing Street, following the recent party gate revelations. Narrator Iain has been a core part of the show since it began back in 2016, and is known for his brilliantly sharp observations. While he often uses his voiceover to make jokes at the expense of the islanders, he sometimes puts in more topical digs. Tonight, he decided to criticise the UK Government with a party gate related dig as the contestants stepped out for another party. He said to viewers: ‘Another night and they’re having another party? This feels like Downing Street in lockdown.’ Earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was subject to a no-confidence vote, which came just weeks after he was given a fixed penalty notice for being found in breach of lockdown rules. Mr Johnson won the ballot by 211-148, a victory which secured his place in Downing Street but by no means ends the political jeopardy his government has been plunged into. Fans were shocked by Iain’s hilarious insult, as one took to Twitter to say: ‘Not iain bringing up 10 downing street parties #LoveIsland.’ ‘Iain throwing a #partygate joke in there, I am here for it 😂 #LoveIsland,’ wrote a fan. ‘“This villa is like 10 Downing Street during lockdown” Iain went there #LoveIsland,’ someone else commented It comes after Iain tore into ex-Tory MP Neil Parish, who resigned after being caught watching porn at the House of Commons earlier this year. Just moments into the series opener on Monday, Iain incorporated the scandal from Mr Parish into his commentary as he introduced the swanky new villa to fans. He said: ‘Yes, we are back and the big news is, we’ve got a new villa. Incredibly, we managed to find one that’s got 57 cameras and a giant communal bedroom. ‘I’ve no idea what this place was used for before but I looked into a draw and found handcuffs, lube and a copy of Tractors Monthly marked “Property of the House of Commons.”’ Mr Parish famously claimed he was looking for tractors after he was spotted viewing X-rated material by colleagues. At the time, friends of the Devon MP said the farmer was looking for a brand of combine harvester called a ‘Dominator’ when he ended up on an adult website. He was suspended from the party pending an investigation, but days later resigned from his role. Love Island continues tomorrow night at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
