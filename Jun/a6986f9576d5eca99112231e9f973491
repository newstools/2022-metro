Tottenham are in advanced negotiations to complete a £51million deal for Everton forward Richarlison. The striker has made it clear to the Toffees that he wants to leave the club this summer and they are sympathetic to his desire to leave, having helped the club to survive relegation last season. Arsenal and Chelsea have both been linked with a move for the 25-year-old, while Manchester United have made enquiries in the past. But UOL Esporte in Brazil say that Tottenham have stolen a march on their rivals and are on the cusp of completing a £51m move for Richarlison. Antonio Conte wants to beef up his attacking options and fears that the club are too reliant on Harry Kane as their only central striker. The Italian warned Daniel Levy that he wanted significant backing in the transfer market if he was to stay at the club and he’s been given around £150m to spend. He’s already been backed with the signings of Ivan Perisic and Fraser Forster but Richarlison would be a significant coup given the level of interest in the Brazilian.
