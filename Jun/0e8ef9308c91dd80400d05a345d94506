A quick-thinking zookeeper dramatically pulled an orangutan from a moat after it slipped in trying to reach food thrown by a visitor. Incredible footage shows the moment the hero leaped into the water at Vinpearl Safari Phu Quoc on Phu Quoc, the largest island in Vietnam, last Friday. The video shows the ape trying to scramble down a concrete ramp leading into the moat – but accidentally fell in. The orangutan is seen struggling in the water before disappearing beneath the surface. The zookeeper takes action immediately and throws in a lifebuoy before jumping straight in after the animal, and dives under the water to pull the orangutan back up to the surface. He pulls the ape over to the ramp and drags it out of the water. More footage shows the zookeeper performing CPR on the orangutan to revive it. The zoo, which is home to around 3,000 animals, confirmed the orangutan survived and is now in a stable condition. A spokesperson said signs at the zoo advise visitors not to feed the animals unless specifically allowed – but many people ignore the warnings regardless. Orangutans have apparently lost the natural ability to swim after dwelling in trees, but are able to learn in a similar way to humans. Recently orangutans in zoos have been hitting the headlines for other reasons. Hasanal Arifin, 19, went inside an ape’s enclosure at Kasang Kulim Zoo in Riau, Indonesia, to capture a ‘funny’ moment. But the orangutan, thought to be called Tina, had other ideas. Astonishing footage shows Tina sticking her long arm through the cage and grabbing hold of the hapless teen. She uses his shirt to pull him closer before clamping down on his leg. The teenager may now regret his decision to cross the fence.
