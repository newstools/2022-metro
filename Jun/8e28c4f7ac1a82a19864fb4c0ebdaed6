Okay, so the weather’s not totally playing ball for our sunny summer dreams. But don’t let that stop you from enjoying a tasty treat – we reckon these fro-yo blueberry sticks will make even the dreariest days feel a bit better. Today’s kid-friendly recipe is for a treat that requires just three ingredients and pleases children and adults alike. These fro-yo blueberry sticks are so easy to make and can be easily tweaked for different preferences – just swap the yoghurt flavour and the fruit. Ready? Let’s get making. You’ll also need a Poppit or a similar fidget toy, like this. Always watch children when eating frozen fruits and don’t serve to babies. If you make these for little ones squash the blueberry before freezing. For more tasty recipes for kids and grownups to enjoy, head to my Instagram, @squashedpickle. Do you have a story to share?
