Sharon Osbourne has reassured fans that her husband Ozzy Osbourne is ‘doing well’ after an operation that she said would ‘determine the rest of his life.’ The Talk host, who is also his manager, shared that she would be jetting back to the US to be there for her husband as he underwent the operation. ‘He has a very major operation on Monday, and I have to be there,’ Sharon told guest Vanessa Feltz on Friday. ‘It’s really going to determine the rest of his life.’ Luckily, it seems the surgery was a success, as the former X Factor judge posted a statement to thank fans for their kind words ahead of Ozzy’s operation. She said: ’Our family would like to express so much gratitude for the overwhelming amount of love and support leading up to Ozzy’s surgery! ‘Ozzy is doing well and on the road to recovery!’ Sharon, 69, went on to add: ‘Your love means the world to him.’ Responding to the news, fans expressed their relief while wishing Ozzy a quick recovery. Replying to Sharon’s update, one wrote on Twitter: ‘Flying high again! So happy for @OzzyOsbourne and the whole Osbourne clan xoxo.’ A fan added: ‘Good to hear. He’s a tough guy Ozzy.  Sending loads of love. X.’ ‘Glad to hear he’s doing well, hopefully he’ll be back to doing what he loves soon,’ said someone else. Another wrote: ‘Fantastic News 🙂❤️ wishing Ozzy a speedy recovery x.’ It’s not known the reason behind Ozzy’s recent surgery, but The Black Sabbath rocker revealed last month that he was waiting to have neck surgery as he ‘can’t walk properly.’ ‘I have physical therapy every morning,’ he explained. ‘I am somewhat better, but nowhere near as much as I want to be to go back on the road.’ Ozzy, 73, who contracted Covid-19 last month, has Parkinson’s disease and continues to battle other medical issues after injuries from a 2003 quad bike accident were aggravated when he fell at home in America in 2019. However, he remains determined to keep making music and wants to get back on stage too, having been pictured heading to a recording studio late last month. The musician last released a song in January 2020 in collaboration with Sir Elton John. It was the third single from his album Under the Graveyard, with his last solo single being Straight to Hell, released in November 2019. As for performing, his band’s The End Tour concluded in February 2017 with the final two gigs being played in the band’s native Birmingham. Got a story?
