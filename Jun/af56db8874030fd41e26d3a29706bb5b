A 31-year-old kite surfer has died after a sudden gust of wind during a ‘mini-tornado’ slammed him through a restaurant window. Five people were also hospitalised after the strong wind hit the town of Villers-sur-Mer, on the Normandy coast in France, on Saturday. Meteorologists had not predicted the winds to be so strong as video footage shows sand swirling up in the air, as well as chairs and tables being thrown around. Thierry Granturco, the mayor of Villers-sur-Mer, called the winds a ‘violence as we have never known on our coast’. The freak storm lasted for a period of 20 to 25 minutes on the Côte Fleurie – known as the Flowery Coast – between Ouistreham and Deauville. The unexpected weather phenomenon was apparently caused by a sudden blast of cold air from the English Channel. ‘It blew more and more violently and it ended with a mini tornado,’ said Mr Granturco on Sunday, speaking to franceinfo. ‘We had a communication with Météo France who had informed us that they had not been able to anticipate this kind of mini tornado.’ He added: ‘We knew we were going to have strong winds, they were announced at the very end of the evening, or even in the night, but we did not think that they would be of this violence.’ It is not the first time a mini-tornado has hit the country. Three people were killed in 2008 after one ripped through towns in northern France, destroying houses and spewing debris over the area, the local government said. Around 40 houses were hit by the freak meteorological event in the town of Hautmont, near the Belgian border. Three dead bodies were pulled from wreckage and six people were injured.
