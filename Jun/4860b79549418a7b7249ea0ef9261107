Four people have been arrested after a police officer was attacked outside the Molineux Stadium ahead of England’s defeat to Hungary. The PC was stationed near the Stan Cullis stand before kick-off in Wolverhampton when he was approached from behind by a group of men. Detectives understand he was then hit in the side of the head in a ‘totally unprovoked’ attack at around 7.25pm, before being rushed to hospital. ‘He was knocked unconscious, suffered a head injury, and was taken to hospital for an assessment and treatment,’ a police spokesperson said. ‘Our officer remains in hospital and we wish him a speedy recovery.’ CCTV footage and body-worn video cameras are being reviewed to find those responsible. So far, four men aged 18, 19, 20 and 21 have been arrested and held on suspicion of assault. Detective Inspector Kate Longbottom said: ‘We’ve spoken to some witnesses but potentially many more people were in the area and saw what happened or the offenders running off. ‘We really need to speak to them as they could have important information; I would ask them to get in touch as a matter of urgency. ‘There was a good atmosphere in the build-up to the game, high spirits and lots of families enjoying the occasion. ‘That’s what made this assault even more shocking as it appears to have been totally unprovoked.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
