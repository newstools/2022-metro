Prince Harry and Meghan Markle returned home to Frogmore Cottage following a service of thanksgiving to mark the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. The couple had joined members of the Royal Family at St Paul’s Cathedral this morning but chose to spend the rest of the day at their Windsor residence. Meanwhile, the other family members attended a reception at Guildhall with the likes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, and Home Secretary Priti Patel. Harry and Meghan were met with cheers as they arrived and left the cathedral, and were seen smiling in the backseat of a Range Rover following the service. Until a month ago, it was unknown whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would attend the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, with Harry admitting he was apprehensive about security for his family. Nevertheless the couple and their two children Archie, three, and Lilibet, who turns one this weekend, returned to the UK to mark the Queen’s 70-year reign. The Queen chose to keep working royal familu members with her on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to observe the Trooping the Colour on Thursday. Harry and Meghan watched the display from a private room inside the Major General’s Office overlooking the Horse Guards Parade. The monarch opted to sit out of the service of thanksgiving at St Paul’s today after suffering some ‘discomfort’ during the Buckingham Palace ceremony. She also confirmed she would not be in attendance at the Epsom Derby on Saturday, and will instead watch it from Windsor Castle. It is believed she would spend the day with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to mark the first birthday of their daughter Lilibet, whom the Queen met for the first time this week. Their appearance at the Platinum Jubilee celebrations marks the first time their first joint royal engagement in two years since the couple moved to California in the hopes of a more private life.
