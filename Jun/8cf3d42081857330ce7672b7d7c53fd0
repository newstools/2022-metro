Kylie Jenner’s brother Brandon Jenner was apparently too supportive of her ‘free the nipple’ photo. The cosmetics mogul, 24, gave her 345million Instagram followers quite an eyeful this week when she posted a photo of her casually chilling in the sun wearing a nude triangle bikini with a nipple on both sides. ‘Free the nipple,’ she captioned the photo. Some of Kylie’s fans were left ‘screaming’ while others said it gave them a ‘jump’ as they breezed through their timelines on Monday and saw a pair of nips pop up, albeit fake. Kardashian family friend Malika Haqq cheered the star on and commented: ‘FREE THEM,’ but it was Kylie’s older brother Brandon who raised eyebrows with his reaction. The 41-year-old singer, who is Caitlyn Jenner’s son from her former marriage with Linda Thompson, posted: ‘😆🙌🏼’ While Brandon was highly amused and clearly trying to support his younger sibling, many felt it was inappropriate that he praised the racy photo given his familial relationship to Kylie. ‘Some things are just weird and this is one of them,’ one commented, while another agreed: ‘This comment is beyond creepy.’ Another joined in: ‘That’s your sister… eww no! Stop sexualizing your younger sibling.’ ‘Creepy. Cringe!!!! You like your [half] sisters boob pictures thats pretty disturbing,’ one added. However, other followers saw the innocence in his comment, with one writing: ‘People in these replies are making this comment weird lol. He definitely wasn’t trying to be creepy at all lmao.’ ‘How is it weird!!! It’s obviously a joke!!!’ one questioned in support of Brandon, while another stated: ‘It’s not that deep.’ In addition to Kris Jenner’s children Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, Rob Kardashian and Kendall Jenner, Kylie has other siblings through her father Caitlyn; Brandon, Burt and Cassandra. A source recently shared an insight into the relationship between the Jenner children, telling Us Weekly: ‘There is no bad blood between the siblings at all. Brody and Brandon are supportive of the Jenners [and] Kardashians even if they’re not physically seen together all the time. ‘Everyone has their own busy life. They live in the same town so they run into each other and sometimes even see each other at events. It’s not like they would ever avoid each other if they’re in the same room. They’re not obviously as close as they were when Kendall and Kylie were younger, but that happens in life – people grow apart.’ Metro.co.uk has reached out to Brandon’s rep for comment. Got a story?
