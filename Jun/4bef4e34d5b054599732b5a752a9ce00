A leading exam board has been slammed after a GCSE geography paper wrongly named countries on a map of Africa. One enraged teacher said that his pupils were left confused after the map wrongly labelled Gabon as the Republic of the Congo in a question about countries on the continent that produce oil. He said he feared the ‘atrocious mistake’ could damage students’ results. ‘Thousands of kids across England and Wales sat that,’ he told Mailonline. ‘There have been a lot of complaints to the exam board. It’s an atrocious mistake from an exam body setting GCSE papers. ‘There were students who were confused by it and were thrown by it. It made it harder to answer the question.’ He added that in his 10 years as a Geography teacher he had never seen anything ‘as bad as this’. ‘To get a map wrong in a geography exam is pretty inexcusable,’ he said. ‘It’s basic stuff.’ Other teachers hit out at the exam board on Twitter. One head of department, who is also an A-level examiner, posted a picture of the map on Twitter and said: ‘When your geography exam board can’t even produce an accurate map of Africa! An apology to the people of Gabon and Republic of the Congo is urgently needed. Truly appalling.’ Another geography teacher, Elizabeth Saunders, wrote: ‘This is utterly disgraceful.’ Parson Edexecel, which is  the only privately owned examination board in the UK,   boasts of being ‘the world’s leading learning company’ and offers academic and vocational qualifications in schools, colleges and work places. In a response to the post, Pearson Geography replied: ‘Thank you for your feedback. ‘We apologise for the unintentional error in the labelling of a map in our GCSE geography paper and any confusion caused. ‘We will ensure students are not impacted by awarding marks for references to either country.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
