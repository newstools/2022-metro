Rebel Wilson has been giving us an insight into her blossoming relationship with Ramona Agruma for months now, before the Pitch Perfect star came out on Thursday. Sharing a loved-up snap alongside Ramona, Rebel revealed she was in a relationship with a woman after spending her time ‘searching for her Disney Prince’. The 42-year-old Australian star – who confirmed she was ‘happily’ in a relationship in May – took to Instagram to reveal their relationship, which saw her proudly say that ‘love is love’. Rebel wrote alongside a sweet snap, tagging Ramona: ‘I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince… but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess 💗🌈💗 #loveislove.’ Not surprisingly, fans were delighted by the news, with many of them flooding the social media post with well wishes and messages of love and support. Little did we know, though, that as far back as January Rebel has been showing off her blessed life alongside Ramona, with the pair travelling with pals, heading to Disneyland and taking in star-studded events together. Last month Rebel shared a shot of her alongside Ramona at a dinner celebrating the success of her latest film, Senior Year, while, in April the pair headed to Operation Smile’s annual Park City Ski Challenge charity event in Utah, where they posed with Dionne Warwick. Ramona also accompanied the Senior Year actress to the 2022 Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty in March, with the pair posing together on the red carpet. In late February Ramona was by Rebel’s side as she celebrated her birthday with a group of pals, including Hugh Sheridan, who introduced the pair, after they took in Valentine’s Day together at a swanky bash alongside Vas J Morgan and Rita Ora. Rebel and Ramona were also seen on the star’s ‘gram hanging out with James Corden at an NFL game in January, after heading to Disney world days earlier. Rebel’s close pal Hugh said they were the cupid who set the actress up with Ramona – and revealed they had been trying to hook both Rebel and Ramona up with people for years. Speaking to 2Day FM’s Hughesy, Ed and Erin this morning, Hugh, 36, said: ‘I think even Ramona and I almost gave it a shot at one point a couple of years ago.’ They went on: ‘I’m a bit of a matchmaker in my spare time, I like to set people up and I’ve got a very good success rate. A few marriages in there. ‘Rebel was a really hard one (to set up) and Ramona was too. ‘Ramona is really smart, she speaks lots of languages … and Rebel is very smart. I was in New York and I’d just split up with my ex and was feeling very sad and Rebel said, “I just can’t imagine how you feel because I’ve never been in love before,” and I thought, gosh she’s a hard one to crack. ‘But then I just had this thought that maybe I’m looking in the wrong spot. I think a woman who’s that successful needs a very strong man … But a woman with a woman who’s successful, maybe they’d just lift each other up … Then I thought of Ramona straight away. ‘I said … Give me a minute … and I told Rebel later on that it’s a girl.’ Adding Rebel was willing to give it a shot, Hugh explained: ‘They spoke for a week or so, and Rebel came back from Australia to meet her, and they’ve been together ever since! Another one on the ladder! ‘I’m sort of their beard!’ When asked how serious they are, they added: ‘For Rebel to come out and say what she said, they are very serious together.’ MORE : Who is Rebel Wilson’s girlfriend Ramona Agruma?
