Marcus Rashford is expecting a change in identity for Manchester United under Erik ten Hag and believes it will be obvious to see it very quickly. The United players are getting ready for their pre-season tour which takes them to Thailand, where they play Liverpool in Bangkok on 12 July, before heading to Australia for matches in Melbourne and Perth. The new manager will be working hard to implement his style of play on a team which looked bereft of structure, ideas and confidence last season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. It is a huge task for Ten Hag in his first job in English football, but Rashford reckons he will make a swift impact and it will be clear for everyone to see. ‘At the beginning of pre-season, you want to get your fitness levels up,’ said Rashford. ‘[You want to] get back to what it’s like to play in the Premier League. ‘When a team changes its identity and changes the purpose of the football, it’ll be quite obvious to see. I think you’ll be able to see it.’ Rashford is looking forward to a return to the kind of pre-seasons he was used to pre-pandemic and believes it will be a good time for the squad to bond and build team spirit under their new manager. ‘We all enjoy getting away and spending that time together,’ said the England international. ‘Being away from home for so long, it’s [the team is] like your little family. ‘It’s going to be a nice feeling. We’ve not been able to travel because of Covid, and it’s something that we’ve missed. ‘It’s always a big part of our pre-season so it’s exciting to be able to go to those places again.’ MORE : Manchester United face obstacle in convincing Christian Eriksen to accept contract offer MORE : Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong ‘flattered’ by Manchester United transfer rumours For more stories like this, check our sport page.
