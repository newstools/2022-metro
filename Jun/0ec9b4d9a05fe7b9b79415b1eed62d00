A pub owner fought off a crocodile in true Australian style – by banging it over the head with a frying pan. Kai Hansen refused to back down from the 2.5 metre-long reptile, saying it needed a ‘good lesson’. Incredible footage captures him striking it on the nose at the Goat Island Lodge in the remote Northern Territory. It was enough to make the croc think twice and race back to the water. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s an everyday event, but I’ve got to stay safe and do what I can,’ Mr Hansen told the Daily Mail. ‘No one got hurt and the croc got a good lesson.’  The confrontation began when the croc wandered a little too close to the pub and started being aggressive. It was easily big enough to finish off the elderly pub owner, who lost his dog to a 3-metre beast in 2018. But Mr Hansen bravely squared up to it by the river, armed with his trusty saucepan. ‘You just work by instinct,’ he said. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
