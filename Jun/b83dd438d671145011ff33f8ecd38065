A ‘stunning’ former home of artist John Miller has hit the market for a seven-figure asking price. For a tidy £2,000,000, you could own the beachfront property that no doubt helped inspire the painter. Nestled just feet away from the sands of Porthkidney Beach in Cornwall, you can absolutely see what John liked about the place. The four-bed detached home offers views over Hayle Estuary and is just a fifteen-minute drive from St Ives. The two-floor house also boasts a hot tub, conservatory and an outhouse, and would make a stunning retirement or holiday home. Marketed by agents Lillicrap Chilcott, it’s set away from main roads but remains well-connected to local hotspots. As well as being close to the popular tourist haunt St Ives, the home is just a short walk from the ‘superb’ West Cornwall Golf Course and village of Lelant. John Miller was known for his simplistic but absorbing paintings of landscapes. A household name in Cornwall since the 70s, John’s former studio at the property has been turned into a two-bed annexe.
