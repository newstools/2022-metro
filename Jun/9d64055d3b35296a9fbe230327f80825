Police have dragged Animal Rebellion protesters off the racecourse at today’s Epsom Derby. Demonstrators ran onto the track and laid down on the ground in the second Platinum Jubilee event to be disrupted by activists this weekend. Six women wearing sashes reading ‘Animal Justice’ ran onto the course as members of the Royal Family watched. The campaign group said today’s protest aimed to make a ‘definitive statement’ against the ‘cruelty and harm the horseracing industry represents’. It coincides with the 109th anniversary of suffragette Emily Wilding Davison throwing herself in front of a horse at the same course. Among the protesters was Orla Coghlan, who said: ‘Horse racing took the lives of 220 animals on racecourses in the UK last year, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. ‘In this country over a billion land animals are killed for food each year. Exploitation of, and violence against, animals is fuelling the climate emergency and suffering across the globe. It is obvious we must choose life over death and stop animal exploitation.’ Animal Rebellion protesters also jumped onto the Mall during Thursday’s Trooping the Colour ceremony. One unlucky activist was dragged through horse poo as police officers carted him away. Animal Rebellion spokesperson Emma De Saram said: ‘Whether it’s horse racing, dairy, or the meat industry, animal exploitation has no part in our world. ‘By moving beyond this and into a plant-based future we can ensure happiness and justice for all life. ‘Transition into a plant-based future would offset 68% of carbon emissions this century, whilst also putting an end to the horrendous suffering animals face right now.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
