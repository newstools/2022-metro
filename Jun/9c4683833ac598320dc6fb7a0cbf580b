The Defence Secretary has called Vladimir Putin a ‘lunatic’ who has ‘small man syndrome’. Ben Wallace hit out at the Russian President’s ‘macho’ view of the world after his boss Boris Johnson said a woman would not have invaded Ukraine. ‘Well I certainly think President Putin’s view of himself and the world is a small man syndrome, macho view,’ Mr Wallace told LBC. Echoing the point made by the PM, he added: ‘You rarely hear the phrase small woman syndrome, you always hear small man syndrome. I think he’s certainly got it in spades. ‘But I think the real challenge here is the Russian system’s view that somehow some states are lesser than others, their rights don’t count. ‘If they want to paint themselves into a new history, they seem to think the way to do that is through violence and invasion. ‘And I think that’s something to worry about.’  He also mocked Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who he called a ‘comedy turn’. Mr Wallace said: ‘She does her statement every week, threatening to nuke everyone or doing something or another. ‘She’s a lunatic like he is, so I’ll leave it to that,’ he added. His comments come after Mr Johnson said Putin’s war was a ‘perfect example of toxic masculinity’ and argued for more women in positions of power. The PM told German TV: ‘If Putin was a woman, which he obviously isn’t, but if he were, I really don’t think he would’ve embarked on a crazy, macho war of invasion and violence in the way that he has. ‘If you want a perfect example of toxic masculinity, it’s what he’s doing in Ukraine’.
