Ajax star Jurrien Timber has ‘stunned’ Erik ten Hag by rejecting a move to Manchester United this summer. The defender was handed his Ajax debut by Ten Hag and the Dutchman has helped to make Timber into a Netherlands international. Ten Hag had been confident of signing Timber, so much so that he told the club to focus on deals for Frenkie de Jong and Christian Eriksen before negotiating one for Timber. But the Mirror say Ten Hag has been left ‘stunned’ by Timber’s reluctance to move to Old Trafford and that he’s now set to stay at Ajax. The Dutchman fears his World Cup chances will be negatively affected by a move to the Theatre of Dreams, where he’s unlikely to be an automatic first choice. Louis van Gaal has warned Dutch players that they must be playing week in, week out for their clubs if they’re to make his World Cup squad and Timber is said to be ‘spooked’ by the warning. It means United will look to land another defensive target, with Villarreal’s Pau Torres on their shortlist. The Spaniard was a target for the Red Devils last summer but he opted to stay with his boyhood club and his decision was vindicated by their sensational run to the Champions League semi-finals last term. Torres has a release clause of around £50m in his contract.
