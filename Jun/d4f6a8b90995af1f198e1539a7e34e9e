Love Island’s Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu has viewers shook after a spoiler clip for Thursday night’s episode saw her crawl to sneak a kiss from new bombshell Jay Younger. After going on a date with the investment analyst in scenes that aired this evening, it is clear there are sparks between the pair, much to the disappointment of her current partner Davide Sanclimenti (he really should have made her a coffee). But Ekin-Su’s hopes for a romance with Jay were quickly thrown into disarray after it was made apparent that he also has an interest in Tasha Ghouri. Ekin-Su’s clearly not worried about a little competition though as she makes literally gets on her hands and knees so she can meet her new love interest on the balcony without sparking the attention of her fellow islanders. In the spoiler clip, the actress crawls through the bedroom to the rooftop terrace where she waits for Jay to join her. Jay then creeps over to where she’s sat and leans in for what appears to be a kiss, although the camera cuts just before the action. ‘Tomorrow night, one girl makes her move,’ voiceover Iain Stirling announces. Viewers couldn’t believe their eyes over the preview, with one questioning: ‘Grown adults are about to crawl on national television just for a lips?’ Former Love Island star Amber Gill added: ‘Ekin-Su and Jay CRAWLING as if they are even going to get away with it 😂😂😂 I LOVE IT.’ Sexpert Oloni penned: ‘Not her crawling for man.’ Of course, Love Island fans will have to sit tight for the Ekin-Su and Jay action in full. We just hope Davide hasn’t got his double vision glasses on… Love Island continues on Thursday at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
