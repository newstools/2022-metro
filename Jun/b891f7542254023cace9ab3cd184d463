James Argent was the most supportive friend as he showed up to support Towie co-star Elliot Wright at the launch of his new restaurant. Arg, 34, has been enjoying a new lease of life lately after losing 14-stone, so flew over to Alicante, Spain for the bash, where Elliot, 42, is expanding his empire, shortly after his reopening of Olivia’s in Mijas Costa, three months after it burnt down. It seems the pals had a grand ol’ time celebrating together, as Arg appeared to give a speech to welcome customers to the restaurant. He also danced with guests at the party and drank champagne with Elliot in a toast to his new business venture. Both gents wore beaming smiles on their faces, suggesting the opening was a roaring success. Elliot – who appeared in reality show Towie from 2010 until 2017 – is getting his restaurant business back up and running after one of his diners fell victim to a fire in April. Olivia’s was destroyed in a huge blaze earlier this year, with Elliott saying at the time: ‘So I will get this out there as no doubt this news will spread fast… unfortunately it’s with regret that @olivias_la_cala had a fire in the early hours of this morning… it’s too soon to say why, all that matters is it has. ‘More importantly in life you get tested.. it’s been a very testing couple of years.. especially recently.. but if you know me, you know I will rise from this.. I will rebuild it big and better then before.’ He vowed to ‘never be beaten’, which he seems to be living by as he continues to open restaurants in the sunny country. Bestie Arg looked super stylish as he cheered on his friend in his new restaurant, wearing a silky Dior navy shirt. He paired the designer piece with white trousers and gold jewellery, looking seriously sharp after revealing that he is now loving fashion following his mega weight loss. The TV icon was warned by doctors that he needed to lose weight, otherwise he would die, and now he feels all the better for it, having been incredibly open and honest with his fans online about the journey. Most recently, he enjoyed a holiday in Mykonos where he expressed that he’s entitled to wear ‘whatever the hell I want’ after settling in to his new physique. ‘I truly accept & trust myself, I really have a sense of control in my life. I know my strengths & weaknesses well, I finally have a positive view of myself’, he wrote on Instagram, sharing a series of photos of himself rocking a snazzy Versace-esque tropical patterned shirt while posing with a cigar and a pair of shades on the beach. ‘I like being different & I can handle criticism. Not everyone is going to like my style or the way i dress but I’ve lost 14 stone in weight so I’m entitled to wear whatever the hell I want 🙌🏼’, Arg added. Arg reached 27 stone at his heaviest point, before which he gained much of during various lockdowns. He eventually had surgery and has totally overhauled his lifestyle, a change that came following a near-fatal overdose on Christmas Day in 2019, after which he sought help to beat his drug and alcohol issues.
