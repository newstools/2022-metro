You may have heard the old-school dad joke starting with ‘a horse walks into a bar…’ – but it really happened in an English town on Thursday. Footage shows the almost unbelievable moment a man rode into The Angel Inn in Burnley, Lancashire, as locals celebrated the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. The poor jockey hit his head on the wooden door beam, sending him – and his full pint – flying. When he fell down on the floor – also knocking over another man’s beer – people in the pub checked he was okay before erupting in giggles. One onlooker spoke about the incident, saying: ‘We were all having a good time, having a drink and a laugh and celebrating the Jubilee. ‘This lad comes in holding his horse with a rope and another man on the back of it, riding it into the pub! ‘He whacked his head on the top of the door frame, stumbled backwards and fell into this other man who, at the time, had a pint in his hand. ‘He knocked it all over him, covering him in beer! ‘Everyone in the pub was laughing and the horse was at the bar ordering a beer – well, that’s what it looked like! ‘After the video ended, the bar staff told him to take the horse out and we just carried on with our day.’ The Queen is known for her love of horses – with previously unseen footage of her petting an ‘extraordinary’ mare released to mark her 70 years on the throne.
