Tyson Fury has rubbished reports claiming he has entered negotiations to fight the winner of Oleksandr Usyk vs Anthony Joshua II. Joshua will aim to reclaim the IBF, WBO and WBA heavyweight titles he lost to Usyk last September when the two meet again in August in Saudi Arabia. With that showdown set to be officially confirmed early next week, the Daily Mail claim organisers in the Middle East Kingdom are planning to bring an even bigger fight to the region at the end of the year. The report suggests WBC champion Fury has already entered negotiations for a fight against either Joshua or Usyk, set to take place on 17 December – the day before the World Cup final in Qatar. Fury however has dismissed the reports, writing on Twitter: ‘This is all news to me! Biggest load of rubbish ever!’ Fury’s co-promoter Warren has also insisted no talks have taken place. ‘We haven’t had any negotiations with anyone,’ Warren told BBC Sport. Fury secured a devastating one-punch knockout victory over Dillian Whyte at Wembley Arena in April before vowing to retire from boxing. Many in the sport, including his own promoters, have speculated a unification fight against Joshua or Usyk could lure him back but so far undefeated champion has kept to his word. ‘I’ve said what I’ve said and I’m happy with my decisions,’ Fury said after his win over Whyte. ‘I’m going to go home with my wife and kids. I’ve spent a lot of time on the road and I have been away a long time. I have fulfilled everything. ‘I am going to retire as only the second heavyweight after Rocky Marciano to retire undefeated. I was unbeatable at this game.’ MORE : Tyson Fury in talks to fight winner of Anthony Joshua vs Oleksandr Usyk in Saudi Arabia days before the World Cup final MORE : Dereck Chisora would have ‘smashed the house up’ and ‘robbed’ students who shouted abuse at Anthony Joshua For more stories like this, check our sport page.
