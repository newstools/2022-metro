Thomas Tuchel will be given significant backing by Chelsea’s new owners this summer, with Todd Boehly ready to give the German a £200million transfer budget. The Blues’ new ownership are keen to start their era with a bang and have already told Tuchel that he will be given more say over the club’s transfer strategy. Previously, Chelsea managers have been seen as first-team coach’s and players have been signed for the club, rather than the man in charge. But, in a move designed to mimmick the success that Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola have had with Liverpool and Manchester City, Boehly wants to give Tuchel control of Chelsea’s transfer strategy to ensure that he gets the players he needs. That strategy requires signficiant investment and Boehly will give Tuchel around £200m to spend this summer. That budget could be topped up by the sale of Romelu Lukaku, who wants to rejoin Inter Milan after less than 12 months at Stamford Bridge. The Belgian is a symbol of the transfer policy that Boehly wants to move away from as Lukaku was signed by the club but was never a natural fit for how Tuchel wants to play. Tuchel wants to sign a new, mobile forward, as well as a central midfielder and at least one centre-back.
