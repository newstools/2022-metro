A seven-year-old girl has died in hospital two days after being pulled from a hotel pool in Majorca. After being rescued from the pool of the hotel where she is thought to have been staying, the girl was resuscitated and rushed into intensive care at Son Espases Hospital, in Palma. Sources at the hospital in the Majorcan capital said she died this afternoon. A routine police investigation into Monday’s incident at the four-star HYB Eurocalas Hotel in the east coast resort of Calas de Mallorca is ongoing. The girl, who is understood to be Irish, was rushed to hospital ‘in a critical condition’ with police clearing a path for her ambulance so she could get there as quickly as possible. A spokesperson for a regional government-run emergency coordination centre had said on Tuesday: ‘We took a call around 3.40pm on Monday to say lifeguards had spotted a young girl lying motionless on the bottom of the pool and dived in to rescue her. ‘They performed CPR on her after pulling her out of the water because she had gone into cardiac arrest. ‘Paramedics continued to try to revive her after reaching the scene and got her breathing again in the back of the ambulance. ‘She was taken to Son Espases Hospital.’ The tragedy comes less than a month after six-year-old Corey Aughey from north Belfast died in hospital after falling into the swimming pool of the hotel where he was staying with his family in the Majorcan resort of Sa Coma. In May, a British toddler drowned in a swimming pool accident on the Costa Blanca. Freddie Joseph Briggs died in the pool at his parents’ home in the village of Aigues near Benidorm on May 25, leading the local council to declare three days of mourning. Tributes were paid to the 19-month-old boy at his funeral service at a church in Belfast where he was christened before he was buried at a nearby cemetery.
