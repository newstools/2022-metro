If you’re travelling to Glastonbury Festival this year, you might want to make sure you have a back-up plan. Next week the RMT and other rail unions are planning the ‘largest rail strike in modern history’ over pay, redundancies and working conditions. Travellers have been told to expect ‘significant disruption’, while some parts of the  country will be left with no service at all, so people should plan journeys carefully. A full train timetable showing services running to Glastonbury Festival has been released to help people do just that – and it’s likely to be a struggle for many. Routes are still running from both London and Bristol to Castle Cary (the station closest to the festival). But the line has been reduced to a handful of services on key travel days, which means train carriages are likely to be crowded with revellers sweating in the heat. It’ll still all be worth it when you get there, but this year planning ahead is more important than ever. GWR has written to customers who have booked tickets for services which have now changed times due to next week’s industrial action. The company said: ‘Any customer booked onto any train service outside of the times we are able to operate will be able to travel on an earlier service/to help customers. ‘GWR is allowing people with tickets for travel on strike days to be able to travel on the day before and up to two days after.’ Click here to view more times and to plan your journey to Glastonbury.
