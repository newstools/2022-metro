Lucas Torreira says there is ‘no chance’ he will stay at Arsenal for the final year of his contract. The Uruguay international impressed during his loan spell with Fiorentina last season but the Italian club refused to meet Arsenal’s €15m (£12.6m) right-to-buy option, which was included as part of the deal. Torreira has made it clear that he wants to extend his stay with Fiorentina but Arsenal have been angered by the Serie A club’s attempt to lower the midfielder’s fee. Arsenal are still looking to strengthen their midfield options before the end of the summer window but Torreira claims he has already been told that he is not part of Mikel Arteta’s plans. When asked about the prospect of staying at Arsenal, Torreira told El Telegrafo: ‘There is no chance. ‘From the beginning they told me that I didn’t have a place, so I don’t want to stay either because I suffered a lot, it cost me a lot to adapt and my idea is to go to Italy or Spain. ‘What I wanted was to stay at Fiorentina, but it didn’t happen for various reasons, so we’ll look for a new direction. When asked about a potential move to Boca Juniors, Torreira replied: ‘Boca is very difficult. ‘It was difficult after what happened to my mother and I really wanted to go there, then I had a very good season and I have one year left on my contract with Arsenal. ‘Any team that wants me has to buy me, which would be around €15m, so that’s why I see it as difficult, although I never lose hope. I feel a lot of love for that club and at some point I would like to play there.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
