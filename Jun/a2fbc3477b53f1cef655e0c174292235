Britney Spears could be set to walk down the aisle with reports that her wedding with fiance Sam Asghari is taking place today. The Gimme More singer got engaged to the fitness trainer in September 2021, after Sam popped the question towards the end of her conservatorship. She announced the news in an Instagram video flashing her large diamond engagement ring and telling fans: ‘I can’t f***ing believe it 💍💍💍💍💍💍❣️!!!!!!’ The pair, who have been dating since 2016, haven’t shared an update on their wedding plans since as they were busy starting their family, with Britney announcing her pregnancy in April before suffering a miscarriage last month. However, it’s now claimed that the loved-up couple have been secretly planning their nuptials behind the scenes and will reportedly tie the knot on Thursday. Around 100 people are expected to attend the ceremony, but it’s alleged that Britney, 40, and Sam, 28, have not invited her mother Lynn and father Jamie Spears, as well as her sister Jamie Lynn Spears, following a very public fallout with all three over her strict conservatorship, which was terminated in November. According to TMZ, Britney’s brother Bryan has received an invite and is expected to attend. It’s not known who will give the singer away at the altar as the final details are still being put together. Tension between Britney and her family has been palpable since she moved to end her conservatorship last summer. During a court hearing, the Toxic singer revealed the shocking details of the court order, such as her allegedly being banned from removing a contraceptive IUD implant from her body so she could have children with Sam. Her father Jamie eventually volunteered to remove himself from being in charge of the conservatorship before a judge agreed to terminate it at the end of last year, giving Britney the freedom to make decisions about her own life for the first time in 13 years. It’s been a difficult time for Britney recently after she announced the miscarriage of her and Sam’s baby. The couple shared the pregnancy news in April but Britney revealed the sad news just weeks later. Metro.co.uk has reached out to Britney’s reps for comment. Got a story?
