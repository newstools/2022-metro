A 20-year-old man who jumped into the Thames to rescue a woman died in a ‘sheer act of bravery’, an inquest has heard. Folajimi ‘Jimi’ Olubunmi-Adewole, 20, was walking over London Bridge on his way home from work with his friend Bernard Kosia in April last year when they were told someone had fallen into the water. After crossing the bridge to get a better view from the waterside and hearing her screaming ‘I can’t swim, I’m going to die’, the pair called police. Jimi then said ‘we’ve got to save her, she’s not dying’ and seemed ‘adamant’ about helping her, Bernard told the inquest. A third man who walked over to the edge, Joaquin Garcia, said the woman was ‘splashing around’ some 100 metres from the riverbank. He and Jimi then counted to three and jumped into the water, while Bernard stayed behind as he could not swim. Joaquin reached the woman and helped her stay above water for 15 minutes until the pair were rescued, the inquest was told, but he did not see Jimi again. Bernard said he heard Jimi calling for help shortly after jumping in and saw him struggling for about a minute before he disappeared. Witnesses said other bystanders had begged the men not to jump in and described seeing Jimi disappear under the water. His body was found six hours later near where he had jumped in. Detective Sergeant Stefan Yiannaki, from City of London Police, told the inquest Jimi sounded ’emotionally charged’ on his 999 call. He added: ‘The conclusion I reached was he died, sadly, that night while trying to save the female. ‘It was apparent he had difficulty the moment he hit the water.” ‘It was a sheer act of bravery trying to help the woman and losing his life in the process.’ The inquest was due to conclude later on Tuesday.
