Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have touched down in the UK with both of their children ahead of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations. It is the first time the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have brought their family to Britain since leaving for the US. Harry and Meghan left LAX with their two children Archie and Lilibet and touched down in London this afternoon with a small team of staffers, Page Six reported. It is understood they took a commercial plane to the UK rather than their usual private jet. The Queen is set to meet her great-granddaughter Lilibet, who is named after her, for the first time on Saturday – when the Sussexes host a party for her first birthday. They will all be staying a ten-minute walk away from Windsor Castle at Frogmore Cottage. However, the young family will not appear alongside the Queen on the royal balcony for the Trooping the Colour on Thursday. The line-up has been limited to working members of the royal family only, meaning Prince Andrew will also miss out. Buckingham Palace said the decision to only include working royals was taken ‘after careful consideration’. But the move has been interpreted as a snub to Harry and Meghan, who quit the monarchy two years ago, and to Andrew, who was cast out over his civil sexual assault case. It is not known which elements of the four-day Jubilee weekend Harry and Meghan will make an appearance at. A spokeswoman for the couple previously said they were ‘excited and honoured’ to attend the commemorations. Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
