Joe Biden took a tumble as he tried to get off his bike while celebrating his 45th wedding anniversary on a weekend away. The US president and first lady Jill were wrapping up a morning ride near their beach home in Delaware when he decided to pedal over to a crowd of well-wishers standing by the bike trail. The 79-year-old, who was wearing a helmet, toppled over when he tried to dismount, apparently falling on his right side and rolling on to his back. He told reporters after being helped back to his feet by Secret Service agents: ‘I’m good. I got my foot caught in the toe cages.’ The president quickly collected himself and spent several minutes chatting with people who had gathered to watch him bike. The White House later released a statement saying he was ‘fine’ and required no medical attention. The Bidens are spending a long weekend at their Rehoboth Beach home. They marked their 45th wedding anniversary on Friday. Back in March, President Biden tripped up the stairs as he boarded Air Force One. He lost his footing three times as he climbed the steps at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
