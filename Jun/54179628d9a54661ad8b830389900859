Hold bags can be costly when jet-setting off away, so sticking to cabin luggage is a good way to save cash. But the only downside to this is the 100ml liquid restrictions and the fact they must fit into one 20cm x 20cm plastic bag. For those looking for a solution, a woman has shared a brilliant way to get your toiletries for holiday – without paying airport prices. Holly Louise was flying out to Turkey earlier this month, but decided she didn’t want to pay for suncream and shower gel at the airport – as often these terminal shops hike up their prices. As a result, she decided to order ahead and pick up her goodies at the airport – after going through security. Holly placed this order two weeks before her trip, then picked them up in the Boots located in Gatwick Airport. So not only did she curb the restrictions, but it meant she didn’t have to pay airport prices – which are often higher than on the high street. Sharing her top tip on TikTok, Holly said: ‘This is your sign to do a Boots order for collection at the airport so you can get over 100ml.’ The 22-year-old ordered full size-sun cream, shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, after sun, body lotion, body spray and a hair mask, for her trip. Holly adds that, by doing it online, it also meant she had more of a selection – compared to the limited airport offering. It’s safe to say that people have been blown away by the clever hack. Holly also stressed that because she shared the products with her friend, they were used up and nothing was wasted, which meant she didn’t have to worry about bringing the liquids home.
