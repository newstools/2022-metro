With temperatures set to climb this week, we will all be looking for ways to cool off. And ice cream is the perfect solution for achieving this on a hot summer’s day. But it’s not just humans that enjoy scoop or two, our four-legged friends do as well. To cater for canine needs, Aldi has brought out its own dog ice cream in two different flavours – just in time for the heatwave. Aldi is the first UK supermarket to launch doggie ice cream and their offering is 100% plant-based. The new Beechdean Doggy Ice Cream will be available in stores nationwide from June 16 at £2.99 for a pack of four (110ml each). Owners can pick between pea and vanilla or apple and carrot for their pooches – and the ice creams are made with real fruit and vegetables. So they are nutritious as well as delicious. To mark the new launch, Aldi has partnered with local ice cream vendors across the country to get the frozen goodies to pups. Dogs can snap them up at ice cream vans in Brighton, Essex and Scotland this weekend. Julie Ashfield, managing director of buying at Aldi UK, said: ‘With more of our customers now owning dogs, we’re delighted to launch a nutritious and tasty treat that will help keep dogs cool in the heat. ‘Being the first UK supermarket to launch a dog-friendly ice cream comes just in time for summer as we look forward to the warm weather.’ There’s no denying that this new summer treat will get a few tails wagging.
