There are less than two weeks to go until Glastonbury Festival 2022 – and we can hardly wait. After the events in 2020 and 2021 being cancelled due to Covid-19, one of the most famous festivals in the world is returning to Worthy Farm in Somerset for the first time since 2019. Campers are set to arrive on June 22 and leave on June 27, while most of the music will take place on June 24, 25, and 26. Billie Eilish will headline the Pyramid Stage on Friday night, being the youngest solo artist to have achieved this so far. Sir Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar will both headline on Saturday night and Sunday night. Other artists performing include Lorde, Sam Fender, Olivia Rodrigo, Foals and Years & Years. So we know when it is and who’s going to be there – but more importantly for those camping, what is the weather going to be like? The Met Office has now released its long-range weather forecast for Pilton, where the festival is hosted. It looks like the long weekend is going to be warm – but there may be some rain, and thunderstorms are also possible. The forecaster said: ‘Temperatures will be average for most, but warmer in the south, with possible thundery conditions bringing potentially hot temperatures for southern regions. ‘High pressure is likely to persist and move westwards through this period, bringing more unsettled and occasionally showery conditions across the UK associated with a north-westerly wind.’ It warned it is ‘harder to offer local detail to as high a level of accuracy’ with its long-range forecasts than its short-range forecasts. So we may not know for sure until closer to the time. Until then, make sure you prepare to pack your wellies. The festival also could be affected by rail strikes due to take place on June 21, 23 and 25, so make sure you plan ahead. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
