Male Network Rail workers discriminated against a female colleague by watching porn in the office and waving a sex toy at her, a tribunal found. Rowena Owens was subjected to ‘extreme sexism’ by at least 16 male workers at the signal centre in Wimbledon, south-west London. Signaller Ms Owens had to put up with looking at images of topless women around the office, and said female train drivers were routinely unfairly criticised. There were at least 25 separate incidents of sex discrimination, the Croydon hearing found. On her first day in November 2015, when Ms Owens offered to make tea, a male signaller referred to as RS asked her: ‘How do you like your oral sex, giving or receiving?’ In December 2016, another colleague watched a porn video while on duty and exclaimed: ‘There’s nothing like a bit of dwarf porn.’ Others discussed rape scenes from movies when she was the only woman in the room, while another came back from the toilet saying he had been ‘spanking the monkey’. Not every incident complained about was overtly sexual. Ms Owens said colleagues would deliberately burp loudly near her, including one, referred to as WC, who sat next to her and burped continuously for more than 15 minutes. Throughout her time, her male colleagues made ‘deliberate and gratuitous use of the word c***’ around her ‘on practically every shift’ she worked. After she raised a grievance in 2017, Network Rail said ‘in such an environment foul language is sometimes used’ but did not condone what had happened. However, its investigation was described as a ‘shambles’ by the tribunal. Employment Judge Anne Martin ruled: ‘All events happened and were discriminatory on the grounds of sex.’ But the case was dismissed and Ms Owens will receive no compensation because the incidents happened too long ago.
