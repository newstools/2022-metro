A police station became a hive of activity recently when a swarm of bees launched a sting operation forcing them to evacuate. The flying insects invaded Northamptonshire Police’s Wootton Hall headquarters on Thursday, just as a Facebook live session was about to begin. The busies had to cancel the event and despite having their own swat team, they decided to call a local beekeeper to rescue them. Footage of the bees was shared on social media with the hashtags #beesintheboardroom and #stingoperation. In the short clip, the bees could be seen swarming around a window with a loud buzzing noise clearly audible. The force wrote: ‘Soooo, we had a Facebook Live Q&A scheduled for today on response policing. ‘However, the room we do them in has been taken over by a swarm of bees. There are 1000s! ‘We have had to postpone it for now but will advertise a new date soon so watch this space.’ It later provided an update on the fiasco saying the beekeeper was in the processof safely removing the insects. ‘@NorthantsChief however has been making enquiries as to whether we could find small enough uniforms and put them to work ‘#StingOperation,’ it added. The event led members of the public to suggest Northhamptonshire Police send in a ‘swat team’ while another said officers should issue the bees with a dispersal order. One person joked: ‘No luck catching them bees then,’ in reference to the policing comedy film Hot Fuzz, starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost. The force replied: ‘We’d have more luck with swans…’ Another added ‘You guys have got to be pollen our leg with this tweet’ while one person quipped: ‘Careful, it could be a honey trap!’ The live Q&A which was due to take place with Inspector Gareth Court and head of local policing Chief Superintendent Adam Ward is set to be rescheduled.
