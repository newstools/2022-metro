A young boy, thought to be around four-years-old, has been found after he was spotted ‘wandering streets’ alone. The youngster had been seen alone in the Church Walks area of Old Colwyn, North Wales. Officers carried out house-to-house enquiries in the area and searched nearby streets overnight. Police confirmed this morning the boy had been found safely. ‘Thank you to all the members of the public for your concern and help in the search’, the force said in a tweet. This morning, police had urged volunteers to return home from searches in case they could be causing the boy to ‘stay hidden.’ In a statement, North Wales Police had said: ‘T/Supt Jon Bowcott, who is overseeing the search and investigation into the young child seen alone in Colwyn Bay yesterday evening would like to thank the public for their assistance, however we would now like members of the public to return home. ‘Officers will continue to search for and attempt to identify the child through the night, along with professional search teams. ‘There is currently a significant number of members of the public out searching for the child, and whilst initially helpful, this may now be causing the child, if still out to stay hidden.’ The boy had been seen fully clothed, thought to be wearing pajamas, at 10pm last night. Officers who have overseen the CCTV footage of him walking down the street had said he didn’t seem ‘concerned or upset.’ Police dogs and drones were also aiding the search.
