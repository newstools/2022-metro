The rotting body of a man believed to have been dead for weeks has been found underneath a couch in a New York City apartment. Police responded to a report of a foul odor in an apartment on Jamaica Avenue near 77th Street in the Woodhaven neighborhood of Queens around 1pm on Wednesday, police said. A tenant made the original call to the landlord, according to 1010 WINS. Cops found the man beneath the sofa, with marks and trauma to his back. Emergency responders were called, and the man was pronounced dead at the scene. ‘The body was so badly decomposed they don’t know who it is,’ a law enforcement source told the New York Post on Thursday. Due to the level of decomposition, it appeared that the man may have been dead for a couple of weeks, police said. His official cause of death is pending a city medical examiner’s report. As of Thursday morning, police had not provided additional details on the incident, and no arrests had been made. An investigation is underway, with cops reviewing surveillance footage in the area. The discovery came more than five months after police found the body of a 36-year-old autistic woman fused into a sofa, surrounded by her own excrement, in her parents’ home in Slaughter, Louisiana. The victim, Lacey Fletcher, suffered from locked-in syndrome, a rare neurological disease that prevented her from moving her muscles. Authorities believe Fletcher may have been confined to the couch for 12 years. Bed sores on her body went down to her bone. Her parents Sheila and Clay, facing second-degree murder charges, were released from jail in May after each posting $300,000 bonds. If convicted, they face life sentences in prison without parole. The Fletchers’ trial is expected to start as soon as October. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
