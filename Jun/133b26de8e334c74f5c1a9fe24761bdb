An ‘urgent investigation’ has been launched after a 31-year-old man was knifed to death outside a west London pub. He was killed outside The Moon Under Water Wetherspoons in Hounslow in the early hours of Saturday morning. He was initially reported as ‘seriously injured’ but was pronounced dead at scene as paramedics were unable to save his life. Tributes and flowers have been laid down where the man died. He is yet to be identified but his family have been informed. Hounslow local Ramon Baggot, 40, told MyLondon: ‘The young people go to the pub there and old people – it’s a bad mix. ‘I don’t go there anymore. I feel bad for him I think a lot of people saw him in Hounslow. Seeing police here is normal. Many stabbings and death. ‘I wish to move out as soon as possible. It’s cheap here so people who don’t like the violence can’t move because everywhere more expensive.’ No one has been arrested for the violence yet, but police have promised an ‘extensive and painstaking’ investigation. Detective chief inspector James Shirley said: ‘I am appealing for anyone who was in the area and has yet to speak with police to get in touch. ‘Even if you do not believe you saw anything of particular significance, please make contact with detectives. ‘I also want to hear from anyone who took photos or captured footage on their phone or other device, and from any drivers with dashcam footage from the local area at the time of the murder.’ There is currently a forensics tent outside The Moon Under The Water and police were seen in the area throughout the day.
