Love Island star Olivia Buckland has announced the exciting news of the arrival of her first child with husband Alex Bowen. The reality star shared the first photo of their new bundle of joy with the family posing together in an Instagram post. ‘You are everything. 10/06/22,’ she captioned the photo. Olivia also revealed they have named their baby boy Abel Jacob Bowen. Alex shared the same photo but added in the caption: ‘Abel Jacob Bowen, but you can call him AJ… The day our lives changed for the better 10/06/22.’ Former Love Island stars led the stream of congratulations, with the show’s narrator Iain Stirling writing: ‘Congratulations guys!!!!!!! X.’ Kaz Crossley commented: ‘Wow❤️ love you guys x.’ Faye Winter said: ‘Congratulations, beautiful family.’ Samira Mighty added: ‘Congratulations!!!! Xxxx.’ Katie Salmon, who recently gave birth to her first child, told the couple: ‘So happy for use! Sending all my love to all 3 of you 💖’ The couple announced Olivia’s pregnancy in January, telling their fans: ‘Happy New Year, Baby Bowen is on the way.’ In the photos, Alex, 30, could be seen kissing Olivia’s bump while the 27-year-old was seen beaming as she held up a pair of tiny booties in another snap. They also took a photo of their ultrasound scan strip and pregnancy test on top of a personalised babygrow to announce the wonderful news. Olivia and Alex met on the second series of Love Island in 2016 and have been together ever since, getting married in 2018. The pair previously revealed at the start of 2021 that they were putting off starting a family due to the Covid pandemic. In an Instagram Q&A last year, Olivia said: ‘We were thinking about it, but then things just kind of changed, especially with lockdown still happening and the world being so sort of unknown at the moment.’ She added: ‘I know what I’m like and I know I wouldn’t be good at being pregnant during lockdown, I don’t think.’ Got a story?
