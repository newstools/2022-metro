Princess Charlotte firmly put her younger brother Louis in his place as they waved to the cheering crowds outside Buckingham Palace. The youngest Cambridge royal sat between his sister and older brother George in the horse and carriage ahead of the Trooping the Colour parade. But it appears Louis missed his cue to stop waving and continued to enthusiastically greet the throngs of people long after his siblings had stopped. That was until Charlotte, seven, stepped in and pushed the four-year-old’s hands down. Louis later proved to be the star of the show on the first day of the Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Dressed in an adorable sailor outfit, Louis showed off an array of funny faces and even saluted the crowds from the palace balcony.     His nautical look had a special significance as it was worn by his father Prince William 37 years ago. William was just three-years-old in 1985 when he donned the same outfit for Trooping the Colour. Nearly four decades later, the Duke of Cambridge’s children joined the Queen to watch the flypast of 70 aircraft, including the Red Arrows and Spitfires from the Second World War.
