Thomas Tuchel has asked Todd Boehly to complete deals for Raheem Sterling and Ousmane Dembele as the German plans to transform Chelsea’s attack next term. The Blues are yet to make a signing so far this summer and the upheaval off the pitch has contributed to their lack of action. Bruce Buck and Marina Granovskaia both departed the club this week, leaving Boehly in charge of operations. The American plans to conduct transfer negotiations himself and he wants to hit the ground running by delivering for Tuchel with a number of statement signings. Chelsea have held exploratory talks with Dembele over moving to Stamford Bridge when his Barcelona contract expires at the end of the month. Tuchel worked with the Frenchman during his time at Dortmund and he believes he can get the best out of the winger, who joined Barcelona for an eye-watering £135m in 2018. Dembele is yet to decide on his future and Xavi is pushing for the club to make a last-ditch approach to keep the winger, who showed good form towards the end of last season. Given Romelu Lukaku’s departure and Chelsea’s wealth of options in attack, it was assumed that Tuchel wanted a direct replacement for the Belgian. However, the Daily Mail say that Tuchel wants Sterling as well as Dembele and that he’s asked Boehly to complete both deals. Tuchel has spoken to Sterling about a move to Stamford Bridge and Chelsea are hopeful of agreeing a deal with Manchester City, though the Premier League champions are holding out for a fee of around £60m. Sterling will take time over his future and feels in no rush to decide on his next month. The England international has 12 months to run on his deal at the Etihad.
