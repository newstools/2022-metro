Horrifying footage shows the moment a motorcyclist is hit from behind at more than 80mph by a drunk driver. The victim was left with a broken back and deep cuts to his elbow after the Surrey crash in July last year. In May, driver Nuno Ferreira, 45, was sentenced to 30 months in prison at Godalming Crown Crown – and now police have released dashcam footage of the 84mph incident. Ferreira, from Godalming, smashed into the motorcyclist on the A3 near Thursley last July, leaving his victim with life-changing injuries. He was arrested at the scene and found to have 105mg of alcohol per 100ml in his system – significantly over the legal limit of 80mg per 100ml. The footage, recorded by the driver’s own dashcam and timestamped at around 4.10am on July 17, 2021, shows him weaving in and out of the dual carriageway and driving well above the speed limit. He then fails to notice the motorbike ahead of him and smashes into the rider, knocking him into the windscreen and then sprawling across the road. PC Chris Nicholson said: ‘This was a traumatic incident for the victim, who suffered life-changing injuries as a result of Ferreira’s selfish decision to drink and drive. ‘I would like to thank the victim for giving us permission to share this haunting footage to highlight the consequences of drink driving.’ He continued: ‘I would also like to remind the public that even if you think you’ve had a drink but feel fine to drive, you are not. ‘By getting in the car after drinking alcohol, you are putting not only your life at risk, but the lives of innocent members of the public who are just going about their day. It is never acceptable.’ Ferreira was also disqualified from driving for four years at the sentencing on 26 May. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
