Chelsea are targeting Liverpool’s Michael Edwards as their new sporting director, according to reports. The west London club are undergoing a restructure following Roman Abramovich’s decision to sell the club, with Bruce Buck stepping down as chairman, while Marina Granovskaia will also depart later this summer. Granovskaia has been a highly influential figure as a director at Chelsea, playing a key role in transfer and contract negotiations. According to ESPN, Chelsea’s new co-owner, Todd Boehly, wants Edwards to lead the club’s restructure of their technical department following Granovskaia’s exit. The report claims that a move to Chelsea would appeal to Edwards, who has been an instrumental part of Liverpool’s success off the pitch in recent years. Edwards initially joined Liverpool from Tottenham in November 2011 and was promoted to sporting director five years later. During his time at Anfield, Edwards, played a key role in revamping the squad by helping sign Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Virgil van Dijk and Alisson. When asked about Edwards’ exit in November, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said: ‘I know he isn’t leaving immediately or in haste, which is cool, so we still have some time to work together. ‘If we are as fortunate and blessed as we have been so far, maybe we can create more special memories for our club in this remaining time. ‘He has been a constant presence during my period at LFC and his contribution to our success is clear for everyone to see.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
