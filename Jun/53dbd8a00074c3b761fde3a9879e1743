Prince Harry fell off his horse while playing polo in California. The 37 year old father-of-two took a tumble but got back on his feet to continue the game at the Santa Barbara Polo and Racquet Club. Dramatic pictures show the Duke of Sussex being flung to the ground as other polo players rush over to check on him. Harry is seen steadying himself on his knees before carrying on with another horse for the rest of the chukka. Witnesses said the duke went through three polo ponies in just one hour in what is a very gruelling sport for the animals. But he was saved his blushes as his wife Meghan Markle was not there to see his embarrassing fall. Harry shares a love of polo with his brother Prince William, who it’s believed has given up the dangerous sport. Their father Prince Charles also played competitive polo into his 40s, but finally retired in 2005 aged 57, having mostly played in charity matches since 1992. The polo game was Harry’s first public outing since he returned to Los Angeles from London after the Platinum Jubilee. Despite being kept on the sidelines throughout the celebrations, it gave Harry and Meghan the chance to introduce their baby daughter Lilibet to the Queen on her first birthday. It was earlier reported the couple were asked not to bring a photographer with them to document the meeting. This was thought to be because the Palace did not want the Jubilee overshadowed by a photo of the Queen meeting Lilibet for the first time.
