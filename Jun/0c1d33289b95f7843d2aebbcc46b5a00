Greta Thunberg said the world must chose between ‘fighting for people and the planet’ or prioritising ‘profits and greed’ as she appeared at Glastonbury Festival. The 19-year-old environmental activist took to the Pyramid Stage this afternoon in a rallying cry for people to take a stand. She said the climate crisis is ‘not the new normal’ and that things will only get worse, although it’s not too late to ‘avoid the worst consequences’. The Swedish campaigner told the crowd: ‘We are in the beginning of a climate and ecological emergency. ‘This is not the new normal, this crisis will continue to get worse… until we prioritise people and planet over profits and greed.’ She said people ‘have been lied to, we have been deprived of our rights as democratic citizens and been left unaware’ of the true scale of climate change. Ms Thunberg called for ‘fundamental changes to our societies’ and ‘immediate drastic emissions reductions’ before it is too late. She added: ‘The forces of greed and profit and planetary destruction are so powerful that our fight for the natural world is limited to a desperate struggle to avoid a total natural catastrophe. ‘We should be fighting for people and for nature, but instead we are fighting against those who are set on destroying it. Today, our political leaders are allowed to say one thing then do the exact opposite.’ She added: ‘We are approaching the precipice and I would strongly suggest that all of those who have not yet been greenwashed out of our senses to stand our ground. ‘Do you not let them drag us another inch closer to the edge. Right now is where we stand our ground.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
