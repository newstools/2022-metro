Love Island bombshell Antigoni Buxton is about to cause a stir in the villa, but the islanders might not know that she and Gemma Owen have something in common, with parents in the public eye. Singer-songwriter Antigoni, 26, is the daughter of Tonia Buxton, a celebrity chef and regular on shows like GB News, This Morning, and Sunday Brunch. While some parents (ahem, Michael Owen), might not be best pleased about their child heading off to the villa, Tonia seems over the moon, as she shared a supportive post for her daughter. Posting a string of snaps of Antigoni, including her Love Island promo photo and some sweet mum-and-daughter pictures, Tonia wrote: ‘I can not believe that my @antigoni is in the Love Island Villa, she mentioned she would be sunbathing this week I didn’t think she meant in Mallorca! ‘We are all so excited for you and know you will be amazing! You have always been an island girl, so I know you will fit right in! 🏝🌊 ‘Hoping you all love and support my girl, I know she will make us proud! ❤️ ‘Tune in to my stories every night where I will be commentating the show, or trying to! 🫣😳 #loveisland.’ Meanwhile, some familiar faces could be seen in the comments supporting Antigoni, including TV star Lizzie Cundy, and Olympian Rebecca Adlington. Tonia is a celeb chef, author and presenter, with her website saying she’s a ‘regular contributor to ITV’s GMB & Lorraine shows, Channel Four’s Sunday Brunch & BBC’s Saturday Kitchen.’ Over on GB News, she’s appeared on shows including Nigel Farage’s Talking Pints, and Dan Wootten Tonight. She also hosted the RTS shows My Greek Kitchen and My Cypriot Kitchen, and has four kids including Antigoni. She’s married to Paul, who has also posted snaps of his daughter on socials, but appears to stay out of the spotlight. Tonia’s not Antigoni’s only famous connection though, as she reportedly previously dated Love Island favourite Jack Fowler. However, their romance wasn’t to last, with the pair going their separate ways after eight months. Antigoni is a singer-songwriter, and released her single Red Flag earlier this year. She’s playing her cards close to her chest, saying: ‘I won’t know who I’m feeling until I get in there – I need to meet somebody in person and see their energy and vibe.’ She is set to make quite the entrance into the villa, with the preview for Wednesday night’s episode showing her lounging on a sunbed as the boys spot her. Jay Younger, who’s currently coupled up with Ekin-Su Cülcüloğlu, has a dramatic reaction, stopping in his tracks and crying: ‘Woah!’ Could his head be turned? Only time will tell… Love Island returns tonight at 9pm on ITV2. Got a story?
