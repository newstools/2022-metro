A 16-week-old kitten has fallen out of an open third-storey window and lost a leg. Little Dory was rushed to charity Blue Cross’ animal hospital in Victoria, London after the accident, where it was discovered that her leg was too badly broken to save. She’s gone through several weeks of rehabilitation and rest in foster care, but now she’s ready to find a forever home. Lara Alford, centre manager at Blue Cross Southampton, said: ‘Dory’s such a beautiful, sweet girl who loves cuddles and chin rubs and hasn’t let the fact she now has three legs get in her way. ‘I’m sure we’ll have no problem finding her a forever home.’ With temperatures set to climb again this week, the charity has issued a warning to cat owners about open windows. Anna Ewers Clark, veterinary lead at the charity, said: ‘Sadly every summer we see cats in our hospitals who have fallen out of open windows and from balconies. ‘Like Dory, they are often young, experiencing their first summer and are curious to see a window or door open. ‘We also see older cats who have fallen out of a window having found a spot to snooze on a window ledge or balcony.’ Blue Cross advises that owners instal tip and tilt windows which allow air into the room without giving cats room to get out. You could also put netting or a screen across windows or balconies when they are open. Do you have a story to share?
