Gareth Southgate has laughed off the row over Trent Alexander-Arnold not singing the national anthem before England’s defeat in Hungary. The Liverpool right-back did not join his team-mates in singing God Save The Queen at the Puskas Arena in Budapest ahead of England’s 1-0 Nations League defeat on Saturday. Alexander-Arnold’s decision prompted much debate on social media, with fans divided on whether he should have joined in on the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee weekend. However, Three Lions boss Southgate was firm in his stance when asked about the 23-year-old before his side’s clash against Germany in Munich. When questioned as to whether he had an issue with Alexander-Arnold’s actions, he tried to cast supporters’ minds back to a well-known face who used to play in the same position for his country. Southgate said: ‘No, I don’t think Gary Neville ever sang it. It must be a right-back thing.’ Prior to their FA Cup final win over Chelsea last month, a noticeable number of Liverpool fans booed the national anthem and jeered the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William. Responding to the backlash over the boos, Anfield boss Jurgen Klopp said: ‘The people do not do it for no reason.’ The FA, meanwhile, have previously defended players who choose not to sing the national anthem, insisting it is a personal choice. Responding to claims that England record goalscorer Wayne Rooney ‘showed disrespect’ by not singing the pre-match anthem, the FA said in a statement: ‘Whether a player wishes to sing the national anthem or not is purely a personal choice. ‘The reasons behind Wayne Rooney’s decision not to sing is down to him. We know that every player certainly does care passionately and has enormous pride playing for England.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
