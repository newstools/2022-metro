Kirstie Allsopp has revealed she accidentally ate one of her AirPods while taking her vitamins and people are totally baffled as to how this occurred. The Location, Location, Location presenter admitted she confused the earbud for a pill and swallowed it down along with her other medicines. After realising her mistake, Kirstie said she avoided a dash to the hospital by throwing up the piece of tech. ‘In other news I just swallowed an AirPod while downing my vitamins, I don’t recommend it,’ Kirstie penned on Twitter, as she shared details of the incident. ‘I’ve managed to chuck it back up without having to go to hospital, but my throat is really quite sore.’ Kirstie went on to explain how the confusion happened, adding: ‘AirPods in pocket, put vitamins in pocket while getting glass of water, chucked vitamins into mouth, gulped water, go for second lot, see one AirPod in hand, check pocket, check handbag. ‘Realise there’s only one place it could be.’ Naturally, many had a lot of questions about how Kirstie managed the mix up, so she then posted a photo of an AirPod among an array of vitamins. ‘See, not quite as daft as some might say,’ she said. But Kirstie’s followers were still unconvinced. ‘I can’t stop laughing,’ wrote one. ‘I have to take many medicines daily, and not once have I mistook anything for a pill, especially an earphone. Hahahahaha.’ Another said: ‘How can you even try and justify it 🤣🤣.’ Meanwhile, a third couldn’t help but poke fun at Kirstie’s comments about how young could easily buy a home if they gave up luxuries like ‘easyJet, coffee, gym [and] Netflix.’ ‘If you cancelled your Netflix subscription you could afford to buy a pillbox with labels for each day,’ they said.
