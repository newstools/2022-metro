A Tory minister has been branded ‘ignorant’ after getting caught out insulting Blackpool and Birmingham. Heather Wheeler referred to both towns as ‘godawful’ during a launch event for the government’s new digital policy. The South Derbyshire MP has apologised for the comments, saying it was an ‘inappropriate remark that does not reflect my actual view’. Her offhand slight at the midlands city and the northern seaside town were described as ‘clueless and offensive by Labour. Labour’s Lynn Williams, the leader of Blackpool Town Council, told the BBC: ‘We’re used to getting (these) sort of ignorant and ill-advised comments. ‘It makes me quite cross that, you know, particularly in this instance we held the Tory spring conference back in March of this year, which was incredibly successful, at our state-of-the art conference centre. ‘Blackpool’s seen the biggest increase in footfall for the last two years. We’re doing something right, people love Blackpool. ‘Maybe she needs to come and have a look round and enjoy the world-famous illuminations on our beautiful promenade. ‘We know we’ve got a lot of social inequalities to deal with and we’re actually meant to be working with the government to deal with those as part of the levelling up programme so, yeah, it’s just frustrating. ‘But we carry on regardless. We’ll continue to invest in our town and our people.’ Labour leader Angela Rayner said it is ‘frankly embarrassing that she’s still in her position as a minister’. Shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy tweeted: ‘What an absolute shower. They tell us they’re levelling up the country but this is what they truly think. ‘They can’t even tell the difference between ‘Blackpool or Birmingham or somewhere godawful’. Clueless and offensive.’ When asked for comment, the Cabinet Office pointed to Ms Wheeler’s apology. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
