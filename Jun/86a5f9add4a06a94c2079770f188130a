A teenager has been arrested over the rape of a girl in the sea at Bournemouth beach last year, police say. The 15-year-old girl claimed she was raped in the sea after her ball landed near her alleged attacker. Now Dorset Police say an 18-year-old has been detained in the West Midlands on suspicion of rape. He has been released on bail following the incident, which took place near the Oceanarium on July 18 last year. At the time of the alleged attack, detectives said the girl was pulled into the sea by her attacker on a crowded day at the seaside. Police explained that the victim was with her friends when their ball landed in front of the suspect, who told the girl he was travelling to Birmingham. He then threw it back to one of the group and began talking to the victim, before reportedly pulling her deeper into the sea and raping her. Detective inspector Wayne Seymour, who is leading the investigation, said: ‘We have continued to support the victim and her family throughout this investigation, and they have been updated with this latest development.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
