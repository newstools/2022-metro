The record for the deepest ever shipwreck has been shattered by the discovery of a World War Two-era US Navy destroyer. The USS Samuel B Roberts was found split in two nearly 23,000 feet below sea level off the coast of the coast of the Philppines. More than half of the ship’s 224-man crew died when it was sunk by a Japanese torpedo in 1944, but records of where it went down were poor. It was finally discovered 78 years later using state-of-the-art technology by Caladan Oceanic Expeditions, led by American explorer Victor Vescovo. The team used the deepest side-scan sonar ever installed on a two-person submersible which can dive 11,000 feet below sea level. The Sammy B proved to be 1,400 feet deeper than the previous deepest wreck discovered, the USS Johnson, which was found in the same seas last year. Mr Vescovo, a former US Navy commander, said: ‘It was an extraordinary honour to locate this incredibly famous ship, and by doing so have the chance to retell her story of heroism and duty to those who may not know of the ship and her crew’s sacrifice.’ The captain, Lieutenant Commander Robert W Copeland, who was rescued from the wreck, later said there was ‘no higher honour’ than to have led his men into battle against overwhelming odds. The Sammy B took part in the Battle off Samar, the final phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, in which the Imperial Japanese Navy suffered its biggest loss of ships. Records suggest the American destroyer disabled a Japanese heavy cruiser with a torpedo and significantly damaged another before running low on munitions. She was then critically hit by the enemy’s lead battleship Yamato and sank rapidly. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
