If you love Francis Bourgeois of trainspotting TikTok fame, you’ll be a big fan of Teddy Dyson. The two-year-old, who is perhaps the UK’s youngest trainspotter, went viral on TikTok after his mum, Charlie Pote, 28, recorded her son waiting at Streatham Common train station to spot at least one train, a daily ritual for the pair. In the clip, Teddy beams with excitement after his mum tells him that the next arrival will be from ‘platform four, for the 12.09 service to London Waterloo’. The video has seen viewers likening the toddler to Francis Bourgeois, who has been trainspotting with the likes of Joe Jonas. ‘Teddy’s obsessed with trains,’ said Charlie, from Streatham, London. The pair wait on the footpath near Streatham Common train station every morning to watch the trains go by. ‘We have to wait until at least one goes past then we can go,’ Charlie explained. Teddy also asks his mum to recite platform announcements at home – and it never gets old. ‘He doesn’t talk much but he just says “train on the platform London”,’ said the mum. ‘I say “on the platform” and give him the platform the train departs from and he pulls that face.’ Teddy also loves watching trainspotting videos on YouTube. Charlie said: ‘Thank god there are people out there who film trains on their platforms and put them on YouTube because I’m the one who watches them.’ Teddy’s love for trains started when a friend of Charlie bought him a little magnetic train set. ‘He’s only got three on a small track,’ Charlie said. ‘On the track, it says Teddy’s First Train Track.’ Charlie says she uploaded the clip of her son to TikTok for ‘fun’. ‘He’s one of the youngest trainspotters,’ she says. ‘Someone tagged Francis Bourgeois in [the video] too. ‘I haven’t had a response from him that I’ve seen.’ One commenter urged Francis Bourgeois, who now has 2.6million followers on the platform, to take Teddy trainspotting with him. One viewer said: ‘Please he needs to go train spotting with @francis.bourgeois.’ Another added: ‘@Francis Bourgeois he’s in early training.’ Do you have a story to share?
