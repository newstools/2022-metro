Ah, the London property market. We all know how depressingly expensive it is to buy even a studio flat in the capital city, but in case we ever forget this fact, there are plenty of fresh listings to remind us. Here’s today’s sign that we’ve lost the plot. For £110,000, you can get your very own slice of London… in the form of a parking space. The 100 sq ft space (yep, that’s £1,100 per sq ft if you get it for the asking price) sits in an underground car park, underneath a posh portered development. It’s nothing special, in case you had your hopes up: just a plain bit of cement with some fluorescent lighting in the ceiling. There’s a ladder in the photos on the Rightmove listing, but we don’t think that’s included in the price. Foxtons, who are selling the space, note its ‘excellent’ location – and they’re not wrong. The lot is on Ebury Street in Belgravia, with easy access to Sloane Square and Pimlico. For context, that’s a very posh area. According to Rightmove, the average selling price of a property on that street £1.87million last year, down from a high of £3,408,182 in 2015. The listing says: ‘This secure underground parking space is ideally located in a portered development in an excellent location moments from Sloane Square and Pimlico. ‘Ebury Street is ideally located for the many amenities, sights, shops, restaurants and bars of Belgravia, Knightsbridge and Victoria with the River Thames close to hand.’ Just a heads up – if you do have £110,000 spare and are considering this parking lot, you could buy a two-bedroom house in County Durham instead (and you’d have £15,000 left over).
