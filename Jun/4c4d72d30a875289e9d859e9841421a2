A luxury cruise ship with two helicopters and a submarine has completed its maiden voyage to the UK. Scenic Eclipse, which cost £180 million to build, was spotted moored in Fowey Harbour – on the south coast of Cornwall – on Thursday. The 551ft vessel also boasts a state-of-the-art theatre, indoor and outdoor plunge pools, gym and spa, and eight lounges and bars. It can carry 228 passengers and has nearly one staff member for every guest, including a personal butler, according to owner Scenic group. A place on the cruise costs £16,200. The ship initially set sail four years ago before being anchored due to the Covid pandemic. It resumed services in January and made a stop in Cornwall while travelling from Lisbon, Portugal, to Bergen, Norway, on a 14-day voyage. The ship also has 114 all-verandah suites which can be transformed into all-weather conservatories at the press of a button. The vessel’s Scenic Neptune submarine seats seven passengers and reaches depths 300 metres. The Scenic group website states: ‘Scenic Eclipse takes ocean cruising to a whole new level – marrying luxury, discovery with the ultimate in safety and sustainability, and giving guests the opportunity to explore above and beyond what was previously imaginable. ‘From nature to cultural encounters, historic cities to ancient monuments, Scenic Eclipse is sure to feature a voyage that will excite guests from around the world.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
