A woman whose life was turned upside down after an accident woke from a coma to find her boyfriend had left her while she was still unconscious. Brie Duval had moved to Australia from her native Canada and was continuing a relationship with the man she had been with for four years. The 25-year-old was left with a brain injury after falling from a car park through a gap in the wall left unfinished by construction workers. She was airlifted to an Alberta hospital last August and put on life support in the intensive care unit. Brie told the Mirror she was in a coma for four weeks and suffered multiple broken bones, with her family warned there was only a slim chance she would pull through. When she finally came round, she texted her boyfriend but soon realised he had blocked her on social media and severed ties. She told the paper: ‘I was finally given my phone and my first thought was to call him and just see if he knew what happened. He hadn’t been to see me. ‘So I opened my phone going to message him when a message pops up from this woman that says I am now with [partner’s name]. ‘I have moved him out. He’s now living with me and my son, please do not contact him. ‘I have not heard from him since I have been in hospital, he’s completely and utterly left me in the dust. So I don’t even have closure as to why this happened.’ Brie also disclosed how her parents were unable to be with her because of Australia’s tight Covid-19 laws in place at the time. She said an application for a special exemption to be made was rejected by authorities. She’s started a TikTok account to share her experience of living with a traumatic brain injury, including relearning simple tasks like walking. Using the name @hotcomagirl, she’s documenting her life dealing with the aftermath of the accident. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
