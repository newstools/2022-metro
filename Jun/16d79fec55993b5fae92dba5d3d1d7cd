Royal Ascot is one of the biggest events of the year for horse racing fans, starting today and running until Saturday June 18. Not all of the 300,000 attendees to the event are focused on the sport, though. For many, it’s a chance to show off their best race day outfits – with outlandish headwear taking centre stage each year. There’s a strict dress code, with woman visitors of the Royal, Queen Anne, and Village Enclosures expected to wear a fascinator, headpiece, or hat at all times. This ends up in an unofficial competition of who can wear the most standout piece – and it’s one that regulars take very seriously. From kitsch, Isabella Blow-style fascinators to wide-brimmed numbers adorned with ostrich feathers, these are our favourites so far from 2022’s Royal Ascot. This article contains affiliate links.
