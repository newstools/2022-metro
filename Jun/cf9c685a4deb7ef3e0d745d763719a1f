Harmony Tan has paid tribute to ‘superstar’ Serena Williams after knocking one of her childhood heroes out of Wimbledon. The American walked off Centre Court, possibly for the last time, after falling short in an exhilarating contest that lasted over three hours on Tuesday night. Tan secured a 7-5 1-6 7-6 victory to progress into the second round, turning around a four-point deficit in a tense tiebreak to secure the biggest win of her career. After the absorbing battle, the Frenchwoman admitted she was ‘scared’ over the prospect of coming up against the legendary 23-time Grand Slam winner. ‘I’m so emotional now. [Serena] is a superstar and when I was young I was watching her so many times on the TV,’ Tan told BBC. ‘For my first Wimbledon, it’s wow. Just wow.’ She continued: ‘When I saw the draw I was really scared. ‘Because it’s Serena Williams, she a legend and I was like ‘oh my god how can I play, and if I could win one or two games it was really good for me!’. ‘I would like to thank everybody today and my team and my coach Natalie Tauziat, who also played Serena. Thank you so much for being with me.’ MORE : Nick Kyrgios admits spitting towards abuse Wimbledon fan who showed up ‘just to stir it up’ MORE : Rafael Nadal beats Francisco Cerundolo in thriller to book place in Wimbledon second round For more stories like this, check our sport page.
