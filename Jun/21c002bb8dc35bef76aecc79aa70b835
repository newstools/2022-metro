This is the shocking moment a groom punched his bride in the head for beating him in a game. Footage shows the newlyweds on stage in their wedding outfits seconds after the game had finished. When the brute realises he has lost, he suddenly lashes out at his wife standing beside her bridesmaid. The bride is stunned at first and winces in pain as the other guests stop laughing and cheering when it dawns what they had just witnessed. She is then led off stage by two friends and puts her head to her hand. The groom’s best man also appears shocked and fidgets nervously at the ceremony in Uzbekistan. Unfortunately, this is not the first time sickening footage has emerged from a wedding in Uzbekistan. A groom slapped his bride in front of shocked wedding guests because she teased him with a slice of cake in 2019. The newlywed, who already looked angry, fed his new wife a piece of wedding cake before she playfully returns the favour. Wearing a wedding dress, tiara and veil, the bride pulls the cake away from his mouth with a smile, causing her husband to snap. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
