A teenager has been spared jail after she assaulted a police officer while being drunk. Chelsea Henley, 18, fell to the ground and lay there with her eyes closed as the PC tried to get her to her feet. She had been on a night out on May 29 with her family in Warrington, Cheshire, when she was told that she should probably go home and sleep it off. But then she pushed PC Pringle in the chest and was put into the back of a van where she lashed out before being taken to the cells to sober up. She had been told she faced up to 12 months in jail for assaulting an emergency worker, but instead was ordered to pay £259 in fines and costs. Magistrate Katherine Whitaker said: ‘I hope that you don’t think it was a good night given that you have ended up in court. It certainly does not look like a good night out to me. ‘Emergency workers should be protected in their work and they should not expect to be assaulted in their line of work. There will not be any compensation but I hope that you will take note of this and that we do not see you again.’ Prosecutor Alex Morgan said: ‘PC Pringle was on uniformed duty with another officer at 2.15am in Warrington town centre when their attention was drawn to the defendant. ‘She then walked around and approached PC Pringle and kicked his motor vehicle. It caused no damage but in doing so she fell to the floor. She remained on the floor with her eyes closed but still breathing. ‘PC Brown tried to rouse her but the defendant would only get up when she was informed she was going to be arrested.’ Shortly afterwards, the court heard that PC Pringle told Henley to leave the area, but she pushed him with both hands to the chest area. He said: ‘PC Pringle took the defendant to the floor and arrested her for police assault. ‘When being placed into the back of the police vehicle she tried to kick out before being restrained and placed in the back of the police vehicle.’
