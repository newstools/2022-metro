Sadio Mane claims he is joining a ‘very, very competitive team’ in Bayern Munich and admits it didn’t take him long to decide to leave Liverpool. The Senegal international has been one of Liverpool’s key players during Jurgen Klopp’s reign, helping the club win six trophies including the Premier League and the Champions League. But Mane has opted to leave Liverpool at the start of the transfer window and is now on the verge of joining Bayern Munich in a €41 million (£35.1m) deal. ‘When my agent first told me about Bayern’s interest, I was immediately excited,’ Mane said in an interview with Bild. ‘I saw myself there right away. For me it was the right club at the right time. ‘It’s one of the biggest clubs in the world and the team is always fighting for every title. So for me it was a very good idea and the right decision to come here.’ Asked why he made a quick decision to join Bayern, Mane said: ‘My agent told me that there were enquiries from other clubs. That’s part of the business. ‘But I got the feeling right away when Bayern presented their plan to me. I found myself in Bayern’s plan more than anyone else.’ Asked if he will help guide Bayern to a Champions League final, Mane replied: ‘I don’t want to say no. ‘Every kid wants to win the Champions League, every football player in the world. I’m with a very, very competitive team now. ‘But it’s still a bit early to talk about the Champions League final, we haven’t even played a game together yet. Nevertheless we will give everything to get into the final.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
