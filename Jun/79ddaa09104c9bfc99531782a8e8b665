A suspected Russian spy has been arrested at Gatwick Airport as he was about to leave the UK, according to reports. The man, aged in his forties, was detained under the Official Secrets Act under the clause relating to spying and sabotage ‘useful to an enemy state’. A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: ‘We can confirm that officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command arrested a man in his 40s at Gatwick airport on June 13 on suspicion of offences under section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1911. ‘He has been taken to a London police station, where he currently remains in police custody. Enquiries continue.’ A source told The Sun: ‘The suspect is believed to have been in the UK spying on behalf of the Putin regime. ‘He was kept under observation and arrested as he arrived at Gatwick to try and fly out of the country.’ Police have not revealed where the man was seeking to fly to. His arrest follows an investigation from the Met Police’s SO15 counter-terrorism team alongside British intelligence agency MI5. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
