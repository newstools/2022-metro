A 15-year-old boy has been arrested after a van suspected of being stolen went the wrong way down a motorway and hit a taxi head-on. The crash, which has left three people dead, happened on the M606, near the Chain Bar roundabout, in Bradford, at around 10.45pm last night. The 28-year-old taxi driver and the male passenger he was carrying were both pronounced dead at the scene. The 18-year-old passenger in the van died in hospital this morning, while another, aged 17, is being treated in hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. West Yorkshire Police referred the incident to the Independent Office for Police Conduct as a police vehicle was in the area at the time. The driver, aged 15, has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and also remains in hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. Police say the van failed to stop for marked police cars before going the wrong way around the roundabout and onto the southbound carriage of the motorway towards Bradford. The motorway was closed overnight and was reopened at around 10am this morning. An IPOC spokesperson said: ‘We understand that a Ford Transit van failed to stop for police before it was involved in a collision with a taxi after the van entered the M606 on the wrong side of the carriageway. ‘IOPC investigators are attending the scene and the police post-incident procedure.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
