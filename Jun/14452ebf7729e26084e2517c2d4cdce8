Coleen Rooney and her husband Wayne look to be having a blast in Ibiza after the Rebekah Vardy trial. The Wag was spotted leaving the hotel for dinner, showing off her glowing tan in a gorgeous white cut-out dress and gold sandals. Clutching a matching gold bag, Coleen, 36, looked relaxed as she enjoyed the getaway with Wayne, 36. The football legend also looked pretty zen, donning a polo shirt and cream trousers with trainers as he accompanied his wife. The couple were later spotted dining at the A Mi Manera restaurant. Coleen and Wayne are enjoying some much-needed time off on the holiday, recently spotted partying with pals in the street. The mum-of-four could be seen enjoying a drink, with Wayne being ever the gentleman and holding a car door open for her at one point. It comes after they enjoyed a family holiday with their kids, Kai, 12, Klay, nine, Kit, six, and Cass, four, to Dubai, which involved some glorious beach days, and even saw the family swimming with dolphins. Sharing various snaps on Instagram, Coleen wrote: ‘We had the best Family holiday 2022. Dubai you were fantastic #grateful ❤️🥰.’ Meanwhile, Coleen and Wayne recently marked their 14th wedding anniversary, celebrating with an Ed Sheeran concert (how else?). TV star Coleen took to social media to express her love for the former professional footballer on their special day, sharing a smiley snap from warmer climates. Posting the loved up pic on Twitter, she wrote: ’14 years…12.06.08′, accompanied by wedding emoji. Of course, the famous pair met with Ed himself backstage after his gig at the Etihad Stadium finished, with Coleen sharing on Instagram that he was ‘amazing as always’, accompanying a group photo in which the songwriter posed with a cheeky thumbs up. It comes after a tense court showdown with Rebekah Vardy and her husband Jamie Vardy, following claims that the fellow footballer’s wife leaked stories about Coleen to the press, which she denies. Their trial came to a close last month but a verdict is yet to be announced. Got a story?
