A Deliveroo driver has been fired after he filmed himself mocking a woman for ordering thrush cream. The motorcycle rider posted the video on Instagram after delivering the order to the woman in Cambridge. In the short clip, the driver filmed himself handing over a Boots bag, which he had opened, containing Canesten antifungal cream. Canesten is often used to treat thrush. Deliveroo has condemned the man’s behaviour as ‘completely unacceptable’ and he has been heavily criticised online. In the clip, the man focuses on medication before saying: ‘I’m going to deliver this to this person here. ‘Someone’s got some problems downstairs, man.’ He then proceeds to film the woman collecting her order at which point he asks her what it is for. When she says ‘it’s medicine’, he responds by asking whether it is for her face. When she walks away he says: ‘Oh okay. Right, see ya’ before looking at the camera and sniggering. The footage of the incident was shared on Twitter where the driver’s behaviour has caused outrage. Reegan Kay, who posted the footage on Twitter said: ‘This @Deliveroo driver decided to open this woman’s package, record her and mock her for its contents. ‘Men continue to have the f****** audacity. ‘Like she’s probably ordered it through deliveroo because buying it in person would be embarrassing and he’s gone out of his way to make her uncomfortable AND post it online ?????’ When approached by Metro.co.uk, Deliveroo declined to comment on the identity of the driver. A spokesperson for company, said: ‘This behaviour is completely unacceptable and we will no longer work with this rider. ‘We have contacted the customer to apologise and offer our support – and we are speaking to the platforms to request the video is taken down.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
