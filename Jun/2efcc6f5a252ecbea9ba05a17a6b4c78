A branch of iconic fast-food chain Wendy’s has opened its doors today in Camden. The branch, which is located a stone’s throw away from the station on Camden High Street, is the very first Central London location for the company since it left UK shores 20 years ago. It brings the total number of Wendy’s outlets in the UK up to eight, with other branches already open in Reading, Stratford, Oxford, Croydon, Romford, Brighton and Ilford. As an American who’s missed Wendy’s ever since I moved to Britain, I was stoked to have one closer to home, and to get a sneak peek of the branch and what’s on offer there. The menu includes the famed Baconator, Dave’s Single, the Spicy Chicken Sandwich and, I was very pleased to hear, the iconic Frosty dessert (in chocolate and vanilla). Breakfast, which includes the likes of the Breakfast Baconator, Croissant Sandwiches and the Classic Egg and Cheese Sandwich, is served until 10.30am. The building itself evokes fast food joints like Five Guys, which are big and open enough to encourage people to sit down and dine in. If you’re interested in visiting, opening hours are: If you’d rather not leave your house, you can order for delivery from Uber Eats. There are also several Wendy’s delivery kitchens in the UK that people can find on UberEats, Just Eat and Deliveroo. Do you have a story to share?
