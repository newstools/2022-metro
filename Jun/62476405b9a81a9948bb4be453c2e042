A murder inquiry is under way after a 14-year-old boy was stabbed to death in Manchester. He was injured alongside his mother, 40, who survived what police have described as a ‘ferocious attack’. The teenager was rushed to hospital but died around an hour after arriving. Detectives believed the attacker ‘is known to the victims and that this is a domestic incident’. He is described as Asian man wearing dark clothing, aged in his mid-40s, with a medium build and a medium height. Members of the public are being asked to call 999 and warned not to approach the suspect. Police and ambulances were called to an address in the Miles Platting area at about 9:30pm last night. Detective chief inspector Gina Brennand of Greater Manchester Police said: ‘Last night’s events are nothing short of devastating as a teenage boy has tragically lost his life and a mother is grieving in hospital after also being seriously attacked.’ She said specially trained officers are supporting the mother at this ‘incredibly distressing time’ as she recovers in hospital. The North West police force confirmed no arrests have been made so far and that a cordon remained in place as of this morning. The incident appears to be a ‘contained and domestic-related incident’, DCI Brennand said. She continued: ‘This is a ferocious attack that has seen a teenage boy fatally injured and we are working at a tremendous pace to find the person that did this and to take them off the streets and into custody where we can continue to piece together what we know about this utterly tragic incident.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
