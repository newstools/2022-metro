The Dyson Airwrap, though a great piece of tech, is quite an investment – so you might be seeking out a cheaper alternative. If you want to save some money without compromising on the results, there might be another solution to forking out £479. Enter: Remington Curl & Straight Confidence Airstyler, which retails for £64.99 –  a fraction of the cost of a Dyson. One user of the Remington on TikTok told viewers to save their money, especially if they have curly hair. ‘We all know we aren’t a part of the demographic that can curl their hair with simple room temperature air,’ she wrote on her video, referring to the Dyson. Instead, she told people to try the Remington option which is a ‘life changer’ and has two heat settings. In the comments, she explains that she uses it with heat protection. Another user of the device said in the comments: ‘The best one. Have had for nearly a decade now.’ Someone else said: ‘I need to purchase’. She then posted a second video showing how she uses it on dry to damp hair. Checking in five hours later, she confirmed her hair was still holding the waves. This is one to add to the cart.
