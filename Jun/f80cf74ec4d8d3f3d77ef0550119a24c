Marriott International says it is going to suspend all of its operations in Russia amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. The company closed its Moscow office and stopped investments in Russia in March after Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. But its 22 hotels in the country are run by third parties and stayed open as many Western companies decided to cut ties. As the war in Ukraine entered its 100th day, Marriott International released a statement saying it would suspend all operations in Russia. ‘We have come to the view that newly announced US, UK and EU restrictions will make it impossible for Marriott to continue to operate or franchise hotels in the Russian market,’ the company said in a statement. Marriott said suspending its operations in Russia would be a ‘complex’ process and that it will continue taking care of its associates in the country. It said it was working to find people in Ukraine and Russia jobs with Marriott outside the two warring countries. ‘We continue to join our associates and millions of people around the world in wishing for an end to the current violence and the start of a path towards peace,’ the chain added. Marriott has joined a number of other Western companies that have made the decision to shut up shop in Russia. Starbucks had temporarily closed its coffee shops in the country in March, but has now made the decision to leave altogether after 15 years. Last month McDonald’s announced a full withdrawal from Russia over the ‘humanitarian crisis’ in Ukraine. The fast-food chain announced on May 20 it had sold nearly 850 restaurants to Russian billionaire Alexander Govor. The new owners have now put a list together of some of the new names that could replace the iconic brand – and they make for interesting reading.
