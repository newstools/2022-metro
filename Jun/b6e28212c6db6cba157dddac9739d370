Tadpoles helped researchers identify a rare genetic disease that can cause a child’s brain to develop abnormally. The unlikely creatures have become an accurate way for scientists to analyse neurodevelopmental diseases, it has been revealed. The discovery was made by an international team of researchers from the universities of Portsmouth, Southampton and Copenhagen. They used tadpole cells to mimic the human gene called glutamate ionotropic receptor AMPA Type Subunit 1 (GRIA1). They were able to show that changes in this protein coding gene was what caused the rare illness which can lead to delayed intellectual development. Study co-author Professor Matt Guille, of the University of Portsmouth, said: ‘Next generation DNA sequencing is transforming our ability to make new diagnoses and discover new genetic causes of rare disorders. ‘The main bottleneck in providing diagnoses for these patients is linking a change discovered in their genome firmly to their disease. ‘Making the suspect genetic change in tadpoles allows us to test whether it causes the same illness in humans. ‘The resulting data allow us to support our colleagues in providing the more timely, accurate diagnosis that patients and their families so desperately need.’ Dr Annie Goodwin, research fellow at Portsmouth and co-author of the study published in the American Journal Of Human Genetics, said: ‘This was a transformational piece of work for us. ‘The ability to analyse human-like behaviours in tadpoles with sufficient accuracy to detect genetic disease-linked changes opens the opportunity to help identify a huge range of diseases. ‘This is particularly important given that so many neurodevelopmental diseases are currently undiagnosed.’ The team are hoping their discovery will help clinicians develop ways to help patients and their families.
