Russian troops are desperately plotting ‘fake marriages’ in an effort to escape the war in Ukraine. An intercepted call has revealed an alleged conversation between a soldier and his friend in Russia. Ukraine’s intelligence agency released details of the call today, the Telegraph revealed. The soldier says officers had ‘no options at all’ and were looking for ways to be discharged and sent home. ‘Either you get wounded, killed or there’s an official order to withdraw,’ he tells his friend. The soldier then explains he had tried to plan a fake marriage in a bid to escape the front line. According to the Telegraph, the soldier said: ‘I already f* told one of my female friends, “go submit an application to the marriage registration office. I’ll f* tell them about it here”. ‘She said, “no f way, that’s not an option”. ‘Everyone here is trying any possible way [to get out] … but there’s no way.’ In a separate call, a soldier speaks of being ‘morally depressed’ after his troop’s water supply was cut off. Experts say Putin’s troops continue to be overstretched which has led to a wave of low morale. The war in Ukraine has now entered its 105th day. Last month, captured Russian soldier Andrey Ushakov claimed morale had become so bad that soldiers had been taking their own lives. Some have also deliberately wounded themselves, in the hope to be classed as ‘Cargo 300’ which means they would be sent back to Russia. Ushakov, 20, said he knew of two soldiers who shot and killed themselves on the front line. He said: ‘Everyone was panicking, and wanted to leave, but there was no way. ‘The only option to go was as 300. Some people couldn’t bear it, and shot themselves dead. ‘Two guys shot themselves, because they couldn’t [cope], there was no other way out . ‘Mentally they couldn’t cope with what was going on there.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
