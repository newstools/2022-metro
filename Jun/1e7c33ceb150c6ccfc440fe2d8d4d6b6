Two American tourists were banned from Rome’s Spanish Steps after one of them chipped the landmark by hurling an e-scooter down it. In an apparent fit of frustration, an unnamed woman was filmed by a passer-by shoving the rented vehicle down the 18th century Unesco World Heritage Site. Police eventually caught up with the 28-year-old traveller and her male companion, aged 29, after using security footage to track them down. They fined the pair $430 (£343) each over the incident, which took place at 3:45am on Friday. Officers let them return to their hotel after confiscating their scooters, according to local media. Authorities said 16th and 29th steps had been cracked, while other sections of the staircase were also chipped, causing $26,000 (£21,000) in damage. After the clip of the pair ends, the woman reportedly chucked, the scooter twice more ‘for sheer amusement,’ Italian outlet La Repubblica reported. The staircase underwent a $1.5million restoration project in 2015, financed by jeweller Bulgari. It is one of the most guarded tourist sites in Rome, with people banned from sitting on the steps in 2018. It comes just weeks after a 37-year-old Saudi businessman drove a Maserati down the Spanish Steps and didn’t think it was ‘so serious’ at the time’. He told Corriere della Sera: ‘Yes, it was me who drove the car down the Spanish Steps. But I just took a wrong turn.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
