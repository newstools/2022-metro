A man wanted by police after a teenage boy was stabbed to death and his mum left seriously injured in a ‘ferocious’ attack at their Manchester home has been arrested 240 miles away in Kent. Detectives launched a murder investigation after the 15-year-old died and his mother, who was said to be aged in her 40s, were knifed in Miles Platting late on June 9. A 44-year-old man from Manchester was arrested in Kent on Friday evening. He is believed to be known to the victims. Detective Chief Inspector Alicia Smith said: ‘This attack has left a community reeling and a family coming to terms with what was an absolutely devastating incident for everyone involved. ‘A teenage boy who had his whole life ahead of him has tragically lost his life and not only is his mother grieving at the loss of her son, but she is also recovering from what will have been no doubt, hugely traumatic. ‘Our thoughts remain very much with the family, and we are absolutely committed to establishing what exactly happened. ‘Detectives have been working around the clock since this incident was first reported to us and we’ve now made an arrest which is a huge step forward in getting the family the answers they need.’ Emergency services rushed to the address at around 9.30pm on Thursday following what Greater Manchester Police called a domestic incident. The 15-year-old boy was treated at the scene for stab wounds before being taken to hospital where he died around an hour later. His mum also received treatment for serious stab wounds but is said to now be in a stable condition in hospital.
