Katie Price has jetted to Thailand after she swerved jail for breaching a restraining order, wearing matching T-shirts with her fiance Carl Woods. The pair seemed holiday-ready as they held hands in the airport and wheeled a trolley laden with suitcases after arriving in Phuket. The couple, who both wore sunglasses, both donned a white T-shirt emblazoned with a pink MTV logo. Carl paired his with a pair of black shorts, and white trainers, while Katie kept to the colour theme, with pink shorts and Crocs. Both of them wore masks as they wandered through the airport. It seems Katie is in high spirits despite recently being sentenced for breaching a restraining order. Katie, 44, was recently handed an 18-month community order to carry out 170 hours of unpaid work after pleading guilty. She was previously warned that she faced jail for the offence. Katie was accused of sending ex-husband Kieran Hayler a message on January 21, in which she branded his new partner Michelle Penticost, a ‘c***ing wh**e’ and a ‘gutter s*g’, while also accusing them of having an affair. The reality star had been banned from contacting Michelle directly or indirectly under the terms of a restraining order imposed in June 2019. The message read: ‘Tell your ****ing wh**e, piece of s**t, girlfriend not to start on me. ‘She has a restraining order so shouldn’t try antagonise me as she is in breach and I’m sure she doesn’t want people knowing that she was having an affair with you behind my back. That gutter s**g.’ More recently, Katie is said to have been reported to the police again, for sending a message to Michelle through her children. Katie shares her youngest children, Jett, eight, and Bunny, seven, with Kieran, with the pair sharing custody. A source said: ‘Kieran claims that Katie told one of their children to “tell Michelle she can’t send her to prison” – he spoke to police about it last week as he feels like this breaks the rules of the restraining order.’ They added to The Sun: ‘He is so disappointed that Katie swerved jail again and, in his opinion, doesn’t seem to be taking the restraining order seriously.’ Metro.co.uk understands from a rep for Kieran that the complaint is being dealt with by the police. Katie and Kieran got tied the knot in 2013 but split in 2018. Got a story?
