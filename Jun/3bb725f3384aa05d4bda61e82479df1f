The family of Archie Battersbee has been given the go-ahead to take their case to the Court of Appeal, after a judge ruled the youngster is dead. Archie Battersbee, 12, was found unresponsive with a ligature around his neck at his home in Essex on April 7. He has not regained consciousness since. His family believes he may have been taking part in a dangerous online challenge. Mrs Justice Arbuthnot concluded doctors could lawfully stop providing care to the boy after considering evidence at the High Court. Archie’s parents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, from Southend, Essex, say the youngster’s heart is still beating and want treatment to continue. Now, they have been given permission by Mrs Justice Arbuthnot to take the case to the Court of Appeal. The family must establish they have an arguable case before a full appeal hearing can be staged. Doctors treating Archie at the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel, east London, think the youngster is “brain-stem dead”. They said treatment should end and think Archie should be disconnected from a ventilator. Lawyers representing the hospital’s trust, Barts Health, asked Mrs Justice Arbuthnot to decide what moves are in Archie’s best interests. The judge heard Archie suffered brain damage in the incident at home. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
