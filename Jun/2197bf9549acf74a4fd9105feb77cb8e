At least 30 people have been injured after a vehicle was driven into a crowd of people in Berlin. The incident occurred in Charlottenburg on Wednesday morning, according to German broadcaster RBB. Berlin police spokesman Martin Dams said the incident happened near the popular Kurfuerstendamm shopping boulevard in the west of the German capital. Some 60 firefighters are on the scene on the corner of Rankestrasse and Tauentzienstrasse. A police spokesman told rbb that the driver has been arrested. It is close to the scene of a fatal attack on December 19, 2016, when Anis Amri, a failed Tunisian asylum seeker with Islamist links, hijacked a truck, killed the driver and then ploughed it into a crowded western Berlin Christmas market, killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others.
