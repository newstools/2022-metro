Shamima Begum fears for her life after being told she could face execution when she stands trial for terror offences. The 22-year-old Londoner will likely face prosecution because of her links to IS, sources say. The allegations include that she helped make suicide bomb vests for the terror group. Begum is currently staying at a refugee camp in Rojava, Syria after her British citizenship was stripped from her in 2019. She tried to restore her British citizenship last year but her bid to the Supreme Court failed. The law allows someone’s citizenship to be removed if it is conductive to the public good. The area of Rojava where Begum lives is a self-governed region not under the control of Syria. Begum is desperate to return to the UK because of her fears about the injustice of the criminal system in Rojava. A source told The Sun: ‘Begum has convinced herself she’ll pay the ultimate price if she is tried and found guilty of terrorism offences in Syria. ‘She’s very frightened and concerned. ‘She’s been told she will be put on trial in Rojava, probably as one of a group of women accused of terrorist offences. ‘She hasn’t been given a date yet but has been told it will be in around September or October. ‘Rojava authorities don’t advocate the death penalty but that has failed to convince her she won’t escape such a punishment. ‘And even if she does, she’s facing a life jail sentence.’ Begum’s lack of citizenship though means the British government will not be able to officially intervene or make diplomatic representations on her behalf. The source said Begum had been talking to her family in ­London and they were getting legal advice. But it is unclear if a UK-based lawyer would be allowed to represent Begum in court in Rojava.
