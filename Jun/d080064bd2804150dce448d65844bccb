An adorable series of photos chart a toddler’s dramatic meltdown over a banana – and how her mum managed to save the day. Little Daisy worked herself into a temper tantrum because her banana had broken in half – before laughing in joy as her mum fixes with tinfoil. Helen Rose, 37, says her daughter Daisy is going through a phase where she’s mortified when any of her food breaks. The two-year-old became very upset when Helen handed her a banana at snack time that had split inside the skin. When she looked at the banana, she instantly welled up and refused to eat the piece of fruit. So, refusing to let the snack go to waste, Helen went to the kitchen and used tinfoil to stick the banana back together again. Sure enough, her quick thinking was enough to cheer Daisy up, who’s mood changed dramatically in a split second. Helen shared the hilarious photos on Facebook, and received hundreds of comments from other mums sharing similar experiences with their little ones. The mum-of-three, from Cheshire, said in the post: ‘Daisy’s just getting over chicken pox so she was a bit grumpy at the time. ‘She hates things snapping, even when she’s eating it, so when the banana was in two bits it really upset her. ‘When she started crying I knew I had to fix it, and as soon as i put the tinfoil over the top she was happy as Larry – it was so funny! ‘When I posted it online, loads of people commented about how they’re going through similar things with their kids and it made me feel a lot better. ‘I’m sure it’s just a phase and she’ll grow out of it soon!’ Do you have a story to share?
