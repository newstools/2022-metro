A four-year-old girl has died after she was left in a locked school bus for nearly eight hours on a scorching hot day. She was trapped inside the vehicle from 8.30am until 3pm in the Hungarian village of Tomajmonostora. The child, named locally as Flora Inez, had been picked up from her parents on Tuesday, June 7, to go to her nursery school. But the driver allegedly forgot her on the bus, after apparently failing to check that everyone had got off. No one heard the girl’s cries for help as the parked vehicle slowly heated up to a temperature of 50°C. Flora was still alive but unconscious when she was found. Paediatrician Dr. Orsolya Ács told Hungarian outlet Bors: ‘More than likely, her body became so hot that she dried up because she sweated and exhaled all the water from her body. ‘She was unable to correct the elevated body temperature, although the body always tries to cool itself in the beginning of similar cases.’ Medics said they took the girl to hospital via air ambulance after she suffered a heatstroke. She fought for her life for three days in intensive care in the hospital in Debrecen, the capital of Hungary’s Northern Great Plain region. But Flora, from the village of Tiszaderzs, didn’t make it, breaking the hearts of her parents, reportedly named Eszter and Zoltan Kovacs. The bus driver, who due to strict local privacy laws has been named only as Istvan T, 56, is now reportedly receiving psychological treatment at a facility in Szolnok after suffering a nervous breakdown. His son told Bors: ‘My father was very worn out by what happened. I was specifically asked not to tell anyone until the investigations were closed, but I don’t have enough information about the terrible case anyway.’ The police have reportedly opened a criminal case, while the municipality which employs the driver has launched an internal investigation.
