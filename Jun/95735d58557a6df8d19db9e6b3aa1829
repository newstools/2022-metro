The Big Mac at McDonald’s is loved by meat lovers across the world – and this strength of feeling was recently summed up by one man in Russia. A former McDonald’s outlet has been reopened under a Russian owner and a new name after the fast-food company pulled out of the country amid the Ukraine war. But the man disrupted a relaunch event on Sunday by holding up a sign and saying: ‘Bring back Big Mac’. Further chants were captured on video with the man shouting: ‘Bring back Big Mac’ in Russian. Restaurant staff rushed to the scene to escort the protester off the premises. The reopening event for the restaurant chain was held at Moscow’s Pushkin Square – where the first McDonald’s opened up in the Soviet Union back in January 1990. Hundreds of people were seen streaming into building as it welcomed back customers under Russian owner Alexander Govor and new name Tasty, Full Stop. A list was previously put together of some of the new names which could replace the iconic brand – and they made for interesting reading. RBC, a Russian news site, reported potential new names included ‘The Same One’, ‘Fun and Tasty’, ‘Open Checkout’, and ‘The Only Way’. Oleg Paroev, the chain’s general director, said he aims to have 200 open by the end of the month. ‘We’re sure that our customers won’t notice a difference between us,’ Mr Paroev said. ‘This is a historic place – the flagship of McDonald’s. I’m sure it will be the flagship for us.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
