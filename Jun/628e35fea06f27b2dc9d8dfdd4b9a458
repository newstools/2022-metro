Starbucks fans, assemble – there are two new frappes in town. If you’re looking for new ways to cool down this summer, you could do a lot worse than the chain’s brand-new banana split and passion fruit raspberry blended beverages. The banana split option layers caramelised banana sauce, coffee, and mocha. It’s then topped with whipped cream and a sweet-tooth-friendly mocha drizzle. While the passion fruit raspberry option blends (as you might have sussed) raspberries and passion fruit on a crème base with vanilla and ice. This one is then topped with friendly pink berry sprinkles. Got a craving? You’ll be able to get your hands on these sweet treats from July 7. Both will set you back £3.65, and these new beverages can be customised in a number of ways – whether you want a coffee or crème base, or one of the five dairy alternatives. These alternatives are available at no extra charge in all Starbucks UK stores. What’s more, if you show up with one of the chain’s reusable domed lid cold cups, you can get 25p off your order. Can’t wait to get your paws on one? Starbucks Rewards members get access to an exclusive first taste before anyone else. Do you have a story to share?
