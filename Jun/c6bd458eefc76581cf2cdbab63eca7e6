After months of persistent health worries, the Queen seemed in good form during an engagement today – even cracking a rare joke. The 96-year-old’s return to public duties continued as she watched the Reddendo Parade, which is made up of members of the Queen’s Body Guard for Scotland Archers. Traditionally, monarchs are given two arrows during the ceremony, a sign of loyalty to the crown. But she was heard to quip that a glass sculpture gifted by the Duke of Buccleuch was ‘much better’ than the austere offering she usually receives. The Queen was heard to exclaim ‘oh, how lovely’ as she was handed the striking ornament designed by Colin Reid. According to Captain-General of the Queen’s Body Guard, the Duke of Buccleuch, more officers were gathered as part of the parade in her honour than ‘ever before’. The Queen watched as more than 300 officers and archers from the unit took part in the parade. She smiled and waved as she emerged from her official residence in Edinburgh for the latest in a string of appearances that have ended a months-long absence from the public glare. The Queen sat alongside the Prince of Wales, known in Scotland as the Duke of Rothesay, and greeted members of the parade, shaking hands with some of the archers. The Royal Company of Archers acts as the sovereign’s ceremonial bodyguard for Scotland – a role first created in 1822 during a visit to Scotland by King George IV. As Princess Elizabeth, the Queen first became acquainted with the Royal Company during a visit to Scotland with her father, King George VI in 1937, when he inspected them at the Palace of Holyroodhouse. During today’s ceremony, members of the Royal Company took off their hats and performed three cheers for the Queen. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
