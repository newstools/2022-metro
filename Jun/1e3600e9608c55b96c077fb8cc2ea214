London’s rental scene is horrific and we all know it – but now a studio flat in Catford has gone up for £200 above the average rental price per month. And to boot, the bed is within arm’s reach of the fridge. The property, located on Randlesdown Road, in Sydenham, South London, is advertised as a furnished studio flat with a private bathroom and kitchenette at £960 per month. Not even big enough to fit in a double bed, it’s so small that even a single bed makes the space look cramped. Then there’s the minuscule bathroom, which has a toilet, sink and shower – all so close to each other that there would scarcely be room to dry yourself. There is a wardrobe in the corner of the room and a window at the foot of the bed. Meanwhile, the so-called kitchenette is fitted with just a cupboard, sink and small fridge. So even when paying £960 a month, you can’t actually cook in the flat – it’s cold meals only. There is however, a communal kitchen space in the building for residents to share. What else is missing? There’s no garden or outdoor space and no parking available at the property. The room is open to single applicants and accepts people on DSS incomes, but students, families, pets and smokers are not allowed. At £960 per month, the rental is almost £200 more expensive than the South East London average of £758, and £363 more than the national average of £597, according to rental website SpareRoom. Bills aren’t included in the rent and with an energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of D, they’re likely to be on the higher side. Tempted? The room is listed with OpenRent and is available immediately. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
