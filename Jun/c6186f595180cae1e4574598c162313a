We’ve went all in with coastal grandma and cottagecore aesthetics – now get ready for crustaceancore. With summer on the way, it seems that we’re all looking for a fresh and bright way to decorate our homes, with crab and lobster imagery front and centre. Oliver Bonas reported a 1340% increase in searches for crab, lobster, and prawn themed products since March, dubbing the seasonal (sorry) trend crustaceancore. Kate Salmon, Head of Buying for Homeware for the retailer said: ‘We’ve long been a fan of a lobster print at Oliver Bonas, their bold colours are guaranteed to add a touch of playfulness to any space. ‘This season, lobsters are joined by crabs and prawns adorning tableware, soft furnishings and home decor across the interiors world. Crustaceancore is a playful nod to coastal-inspired interiors that we are welcoming into our homes this summer.’ To work the look, go for kitschy pieces that stand out. Nautical colours like blue and red also help pull the theme together in a room. Here are our favourite crustaceancore pieces to get in on the crabby craze. Buy for £49.50 at Oliver Bonas.
