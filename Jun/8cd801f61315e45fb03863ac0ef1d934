A woman has been left with potentially life-changing injuries after being attacked by a dog in Lancaster. The victim, a cyclist in her 40s, was taken to hospital with serious leg injuries after the animal stayed latched on to her for several minutes in the terrifying attack. Police were called at around 4.20pm on May 5 by paramedics who were treating her for her wounds. She was cycling with a friend behind Priory Church, close to Millennium Bridge when the pair had to brake to avoid a woman and child, Lancashire police said. They were later approached by a man with two brown Staffordshire bull terrier or bullmastiff-type dogs who accused them of almost knocking into his child. He was then said to have slapped one of his dogs on the head, causing it to bite the victim on her upper leg. The dog stayed attached to her for several minutes before she was able to break free. The woman, from Morecambe, was taken to Royal Lancaster Infirmary and has since been discharged. Police are appealing for information in an attempt to identify the dog walker. He is described as white, 5ft 9in to 5ft 10in tall, slim, with brown short back and sides hair. He is thought to be in his early-30s and was not wearing a top. PC Richard Hannaford, of Morecambe police, said: ‘This incident has left the victim with a very serious injury. ‘As part of our ongoing inquiries we need to identify and speak to the man who was walking the dogs. ‘I would urge anybody who knows who he is – or the man himself – to contact the police as soon as possible. ‘Similarly, I would ask any witnesses or anybody with CCTV, dashcam or mobile phone footage which could assist our investigation to please get in touch.’ Anyone with information is urged to get in touch by email at 5891@lancashire.police.uk or by calling 101, quoting log 0917 of May 5.
