Sajid Javid is looking at making the word ‘women’ feature more prominently on the NHS’s web page about ovarian cancer. The health secretary told Sky News ‘common sense and the right language’ should be used to ‘give people the best possible care’. The word ‘women’ is absent from the the start of the NHS site’s overview of the disease. It begins: ‘Ovarian cancer affects the two small organs (ovaries) that store the eggs needed to make babies. Anyone with ovaries can get ovarian cancer.’ It does appear on the third section of the guidance, which reads: ‘Anyone with ovaries can get ovarian cancer. ‘This includes women, trans men, non-binary people and intersex people with ovaries.’ Questioned about reports the NHS has cut ‘women’ from advice pages, Mr Javid said: ‘I haven’t seen that particular report but I have heard of instances like that and I don’t think it’s right. ‘You won’t be surprised to know that, as the health secretary, I think that your sex matters. ‘It’s important that when messaging is given to people for cancers that words like women and men are used.’ Asked if he will change the wording, he said: ‘I am looking into this. I want to listen to why someone might have taken a different approach – I don’t just want to assume – but I think I’ve made my views clear. ‘I know there’s some sensitivity around this language but we have to use common sense and the right language so we can give people the best possible patient care.’ NHS Digital said: ‘It is not correct to say there is no mention of women on the ovarian cancer pages.’ It added pages were updated ‘to keep them in line with the best clinical evidence’.
