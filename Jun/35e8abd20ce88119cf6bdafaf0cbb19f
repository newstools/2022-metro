Emma Raducanu’s forehand is normally the only thing we’re looking at when the British tennis star hits the court. However, on Centre Court yesterday, she was also wearing some pretty eye-catching accessories, kitted out in £30,000 worth of Tiffany jewellery for this year’s Wimbledon. Competing against Belgian player Alison Van Uytvanck, the 19-year-old was representing the iconic brand she has been an ambassador for since last September. The tennis star donned a pair of Tiffany Victoria pearl drop earrings set in platinum, thought to be worth £8,000, as well as a matching necklace from the same collection priced at £4,125. On her wrist, Emma wore a white-gold Tiffany bangle encrusted with round brilliant cut diamonds, coming in at a whopping £19,800. The Tiffany Victoria collection is made up of ‘designs for those who know too many diamonds are never enough,’ featuring flower and vine motifs shine in precious metals with a variety of shining stones. If you can’t quite justify the price tag, however, there are plenty of alternatives with a similar style. Try these silver-toned and pearl-studded pieces for timeless pieces for Wimbledon and beyond.
