One pet owner’s nightmare finally turned into a dream 10 years later. A cat which went missing for a decade has been found 250 miles away from home, to the delight of his owner. Chubbs, a grey and cream tabby, was thought to have been snatched by somebody outside his home in Dorset. The family, which includes Donna Gallacher and her two young daughters, spent days wandering the streets of Weymouth trying to find poor Chubbs. After all these years the family had lost all hope. But one day the family received a phone call from a vet in Manchester saying Chubbs had been found in Ashton-in-Makerfield – exactly a decade later. The bedraggled cat was discovered by a hedgehog rescuer who discovered him all alone and struggling to walk. Chubbs’ microchip revealed his owners lived hundreds of miles away on the Dorset coast. He has now been reunited with his family, who are still shocked Chubbs was found after all these years. Donna said: ‘It was surreal when I got that phone call. I didn’t think I was ever going to see him again. I’ve been searching for Chubbs for 10 years. ‘I was overwhelmed by it. I knew in my heart that he was still alive, I just knew he was out there somewhere. ‘The fact that he’s come back to me after all this time is a miracle. It’s just magical news. ‘Since he’s been back Chubbs has been following me around like a little puppy. ‘He hasn’t changed, he’s a real character and he’s already gaining weight and looking more like himself. He’s been really happy to just sit on my bed chilling. ‘When Chubbs went missing I couldn’t sleep and I couldn’t stop crying. I’ve been searching for him for 10 years. ‘He’s now 15 years old and can see out his life back at home where he belongs.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
