A supercar owned by Cristiano Ronaldo has been involved in a crash on the island of Majorca, according to reports. An employee of the Manchester United star is thought to have been behind the wheel when the car careered into a property in the east coast resort of Sa Coma. The luxury £1.7million vehicle was shipped to the Spanish island together with a Mercedes-Benz G-Class for the footballer to enjoy during his family summer holidays. The front of the Bugatti was damaged but the driver is believed to be unharmed after the crash happened around 11am local time this morning. Police are currently investigating the incident. Ronaldo jetted to Majorca with his five children and girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez on June 14. They are renting a luxury home at the foot of the Tramuntana Mountains and enjoying days out on the footballer’s super yacht. It is the first time the couple have holidayed with their daughter Esmeralda, whose twin brother died during childbirth in April. The family are expected to stay at the villa – which boasts a pool surrounded by palm trees, several Jacuzzis, a beach volleyball court and a mini-football pitch – for another three or four days. The Manchester United frontman’s former teammate, Sergio Ramos, also selected the same property for a sunshine break with his family. Ronaldo and his family enjoyed a break in Majorca last summer, staying at the historic Manresa Castle –  Castell de Manresa in Catalan Spanish – which costs £10,000 a night. The seven-bed seafront mansion was built in 1715 to defend the coast from attacks from the British, who at the time controlled Majorca. Ronaldo and girlfriend Georgina laid bare their heartbreak over the death of their baby boy, describing it as ‘the greatest pain that any parent can feel’. ‘Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness,’ the couple revealed.
