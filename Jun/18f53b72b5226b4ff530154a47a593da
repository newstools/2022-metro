A further seven cases of hepatitis have been identified in young children in the UK. It takes the total confirmed so far up to 258 after a mystery surge in incidences of the illness since January. Of the verified cases, 183 are resident in England, 35 are in Scotland, 18 are in Wales and 22 are in Northern Ireland. The cases are primarily being found in children under the age of five, according the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). A link between the rise and the adenovirus, a common illness which causes flu-like fevers, remains under investigation. Cases usually begin with diarrhoea and nausea before the onset of jaundice, health officials said. Parents are being urged to watch out for a yellow tinge in the whites of their children’s eyes, a telltale sign of the illness. Some health experts have speculated there may be a link between the rise in cases and the lower exposure to viruses children had during lockdowns. Similar spikes in hepatitis diagnosis have been confirmed around the world. The UKHSA said a ‘small number of children over the age of 10 are also being investigated as possible cases’. While hepatitis can cause serious illness, no deaths have been recorded among recent cases. As of June 17, a dozen of children suffering from the virus have received liver transplants.
