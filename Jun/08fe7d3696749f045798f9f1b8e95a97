Meet Thelma and Louise, the bonded senior citizen cats who are looking for a home in which to enjoy their twilight years. Described as ‘sweet and playful’ on the RSPCA website, Thelma and Louise are looking for a relaxing environment. Louise appears to be deaf and may have a little dementia, because she can get confused and disoriented on occasion. Meanwhile, Thelma has early-stage kidney disease, which means she needs to be on a special diet. Both cats have a low-grade heart murmur – Louise coughs sometimes and Thelma needs daily medication for high blood pressure. They’ll also both need regular checkups with the vet, with their next one due in August. Due to their needs, the charity is willing to discuss contributing to their meds and check-ups. Thelma and Louise are both described as a bit timid at first, so prospective owners will need to be ready for them to hide from you early on. Their listing on the website goes on to say: ‘Once used to you these lap cats enjoy attention, strokes and they will run to greet you. ‘Ideally, their new owner would be at home for a good part of the day as they like to have lots of company. ‘Thelma and Louise spend most of their time together either curled up sleeping or grooming each other. They are sprightly for their age and both very playful but you will have to be patient before seeing this side of their personalities.’ If you think you could give Thelma and Louise the perfect home, get in touch through their RSPCA profile.
