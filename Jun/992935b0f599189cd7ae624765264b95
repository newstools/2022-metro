Katie Price is said to have been reported to the police again for allegedly breaching her restraining order for a second time and sending a message to her ex Kieran Hayler’s fiancee. Just days ago, Price swerved jail after pleading guilty to breaching the restraining order, but Hayler has again got the police involved after Price allegedly sent a message to his fiancee Michelle Penticost through one of her children. Price shares her youngest children, Jett, eight, and Bunny, seven, with Hayler, with the pair sharing custody. A source said: ‘Kieran claims that Katie told one of their children to “tell Michelle she can’t send her to prison” – he spoke to police about it last week as he feels like this breaks the rules of the restraining order.’ They added to The Sun: ‘He is so disappointed that Katie swerved jail again and, in his opinion, doesn’t seem to be taking the restraining order seriously.’ Metro.co.uk understands from a rep for Hayler that the complaint is being dealt with by the police. Price was recently handed an 18-month community order to carry out 170 hours of unpaid work after pleading guilty to breaching her restraining order. Judge Stephen Mooney told Price: ‘In my judgement, this offence was committed out of anger. ‘The words you used were highly offensive and inflammatory so the breach cannot be considered minor. ‘In my judgement, balancing the aggravating and mitigating factors, the appropriate sentence is a medium-level community order.’ Price showed no emotion as the verdict was announced but gave a brief smile as she left the dock. Later reacting to the verdict, Hayler and Penticost shared their disappointment. Price was accused of sending ex-husband Hayler a message on January 21, in which she branded his new partner Penticost, a ‘c***ing wh**e’ and a ‘gutter s*g’, while also accusing them of having an affair. The reality star had been banned from contacting Penticost directly or indirectly under the terms of a restraining order imposed in June 2019. The message read: ‘Tell your ****ing wh**e, piece of s**t, girlfriend not to start on me. ‘She has a restraining order so shouldn’t try antagonise me as she is in breach and I’m sure she doesn’t want people knowing that she was having an affair with you behind my back. That gutter s**g.’ Following her guilty plea, Judge Stephen Mooney had warned Price in May: ‘Clearly you have accepted responsibility for this offence and that you indirectly tried to communicate Ms Penticost despite her restraining order against you. ‘I must warn you Ms Price that you are at risk of going to prison.’ Price married Hayler in 2013 but the pair split in 2018 with their divorce finalised in 2021. She is currently engaged to former Love Island star Carl Woods, while Hayler proposed to Penticost in 2020.
