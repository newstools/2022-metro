Doctors had to remove a miniature statue of Krishna from a man’s throat after he accidentally swallowed it while drinking holy water. The man went to his local surgery complaining of throat problems, and was given an X-ray. It clearly showed the 5cm figurine of the Hindu god lodged in the top of his throat. He was then rushed to hospital after complaining of breathing difficulties, throat pain and painful swallowing. The man realised he had mistakenly swallowed the figurine on June 21 during his morning routine. Each day, the man drank holy water with a Krishna statue immersed in it, and mistakenly swallowed it on that occasion. A team of doctors at a hospital in Belagavi, India, performed an endoscopy and removed the foreign object. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
