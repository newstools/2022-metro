Summer has us feeling all types of ways. The sun, the long evenings, the rosé – we adore it all. This time of year always has us reassessing her clothing choices and our interior options too. It’s a time to make the home a little brighter and to create a home destination escape. To help us achieve this look with ease, H&M have released an interiors collection that is reflective of a modern Moroccan dream. Using warm hues of pink and beige, the pieces are abstract yet inviting. From cushions to vases to throws, all of the items released will work just as well adorning the outside of a home as they would inside. Some of our favourite pieces include the pink stoneware plant pot, the rattan stool and the selection of printed cushions. Sure to be popular among the masses, we advise to pick up your favourites as soon as you can. Here are our top picks: Get it for £3.99 at H&M. Get a two-pack for £6.99 at H&M.
