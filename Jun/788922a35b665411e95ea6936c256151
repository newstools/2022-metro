The Jackson campus of Southwestern Community College in Sylva went into ‘an immediate lockdown’ on Tuesday morning, Fox News reported. Police were seeking to arrest a felon on the loose donning body armor, according to the school. In an alert sent shortly before 10.30am, the school advised staff to secure students in the building and lock classroom and office doors.
