A South Carolina man won $100,000 after trying a strategy he learned while watching TLC’s ‘Lottery Changed My Life.’ The man spent $25 per week for three months playing the lottery. During the first week, he won $500, but as he continued playing he racked up more winning tickets and by the seventh week, he took home $100,000. He won the massive prize on May 28 while playing a Powerball ticket. The man first thought he had only won $50,000 by matching two numbers, according to WCVB. The lucky winner then was fortunate enough to have his wife look over the ticket, and she realized he had matched four of five white balls and the red Powerball, bringing his total prize winnings up to $100,000. ‘I didn’t even know how to play Powerball,’ the man told lottery officials in South Carolina. After hitting the jackpot, the unidentified man bought a new car. He says he plans to continue playing by the strategy and will continue to buy lottery tickets through the three-month period. The odds of matching four white ball numbers and the red Powerball are 1 in 913,129, according to the South Carolina Lottery site. TLC’s ‘Lottery Changed My Life’ showcases the lives of ordinary people who win life-changing amounts of money while playing the lottery.
