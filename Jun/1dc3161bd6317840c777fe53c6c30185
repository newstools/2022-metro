Ed Sheeran was given the privilege of closing the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee festivities, as he performed an acoustic version of his track Perfect in honour of Her Majesty. Queen Elizabeth II has been fairly absent from the weekend of events, after experiencing some ‘discomfort’ amid her mobility issues earlier this week. But she was back out on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on Sunday night to round things off after an incredible afternoon pageant. Just before The Queen stepped out, onlookers were treated to a special performance from hit singer Ed, who brought everything to a close. He looked dapper in a navy suit, as he beamed on stage during the stunning rendition of his beloved track. Those watching at home were also left emotional as footage of the Queen from her 70-year-long reign played over the top. This included clips with her late husband Prince Philip, who died last April, aged 99. Many of those watching at home were moved to tears during the heartfelt end to the festivities. Taking to Twitter, one viewer said: ‘A massive 👏 Ed Sheeran, thank you. Tears all over, absolutely beautiful.’ ‘How can Ed Sheeran have me crying singing for the queen’s jubilee 😢 aww it’s so sweet,’ echoed someone else. Another shared: ‘Simply love Ed Sheeran! #PlatinumJubileePageant what a lovely tribute to end the Pageant!’ A fan added: ‘These archival images of the Queen shown as Ed Sheeran sings are really moving.’ ‘That whole Jubilee pageant was amazing and Ed Sheeran singing Perfect with the clips of the Queen’s life being shown had me in tears,’ said another. Speaking ahead of his performance Ed described the occasion as a ‘full circle moment’ for him. He told BBC host Anita Rani: ‘For me, this is kind of like a full circle, nostalgia moment because this is the event that I picked up guitar 20 years ago after seeing Eric Clapton playing on stage. ‘And then I got to play it 10 years ago for the Diamond Jubilee. It’s really really nice to be back, it’s just a great atmosphere here.’ Got a story?
