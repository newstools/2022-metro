A Swedish city is using a highly unusual strategy to combat littering. Amused residents have been surprised to hear their bins expressing pleasure when fed rubbish. The seemingly-aroused waste collectors say phrases like: ‘mmm, yeah’, ‘just to the left’ and ‘that was crazy good’, according to The Local. The talking bins, located near the city’s main shopping street on the Davidshallsbron bridge, are designed to raise awareness about littering. Talking seductive rubbish, the woman who runs the city’s roads department explained: ‘The sentences are part of the campaign’s intention to get more people to talk about the dirtiest thing there is: littering. ‘The stuff that ends up in our streets, squares, and sea.’ Marie Persson told Sydsvenskan newspaper: ‘So please go ahead and feed the bins with more rubbish… yes, just like that.’ Video shows one resident repeatedly opening and shutting the bin and laughing as it makes comments. Ms Persson teased readers about the identity behind the voice – saying it was a famous woman but declining to reveal their name. She added that the recorded voice was intended to be a funny way of getting a message across and the bins are meant to be ‘a positive reinforcement to people who do the right thing, by giving them a laugh’. The Local reported that Malmo purchased 18 ‘advanced’ bins five years ago – but only two talk – and this is the first time they have been given a seductive voiceover. It is unclear if there are plans to add the voice to other bins. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
