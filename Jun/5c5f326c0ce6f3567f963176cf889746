A heroin pusher who was being questioned by police gave the game away when his ringtone went off saying ‘it’s your drug dealer’. David Owens, 48, first aroused suspicion in January 2020 when he was spotted by plain clothes officers while involved in an ‘exchange’ on the streets. Police then went round to his home in Swansea, and as he was being detained, his ringtone went off at the worst possible time for him. Officers searched him and found he was carrying £180 in cash, and then a look through his house revealed wraps of heroin and £900. They also found three weighing scales, a tick-list of money owed, and another bundle of cash worth £7,646, Swansea Crown Court. The father-of-six downloaded his incriminating ringtone when he started drug dealing. Owens, of Uplands, Swansea, previously pleaded guilty to possession of heroin with intent to supply. He has 26 previous convictions for 159 crimes including perverting the course of justice, possession of cannabis and weapons offences. His lawyer, Anthony O’Connell, said his client has an ‘addictive personality’ for drink and drugs and that his life had spiralled downwards after ‘getting in with the wrong people’. Recorder Christian Jowett sentenced Owens to four years and three months in prison. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
