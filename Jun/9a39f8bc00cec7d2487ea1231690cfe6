This is the moment a Ukrainian jet narrowly dodges a Russian missile lock during a dramatic dogfight. Video footage shows the pilot performing some impressive manoeuvres in order to avoid incoming rockets. The Soviet-designed Su-25 fighter jet can be seen flying over a road in the eastern Donbas region. Suddenly the pilot’s radar flashes suggesting he has been targeted, so he performs a variety of complex manoeuvres to avoid the attack. At one point, the aircraft’s wing gets dangerously close to the ground and some trees during the clash. Miraculously, the pilot was eventually able to escape before the Russian rocket was launched. Meanwhile, across other areas of the Donbas, the remains of more than 200 Ukrainian fighters killed in the battle for Mariupol have been returned, Ukraine’s military intelligence agency says. It said most of the 210 bodies returned by Russian forces were from the Azovstal steelworks, which became the city’s last remaining stronghold. The agency did not specify how many more bodies are believed to remain in the rubble of the plant turned fortress. Russia now controls the whole of the southern port city after subjecting it to a brutal medieval-style siege for months. On Saturday Ukraine said both sides had each exchanged 160 dead fighters. It is unclear whether any more bodies have since been handed over. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
