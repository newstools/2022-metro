Gone are the days of letting the world know who your beau is with a simple padlock emoji alongside their initials in your Instagram bio, a practice now considered cheugy on all counts. But public displays of affection are far from dead, and the newest way to show your dedication to your partner is with your hands – and no, we’re not talking about an engagement ring. Enter: the boyfriend manicure. Less permanent than a tattoo, but iconic enough in its own right, the boyfriend manicure is slowly becoming the latest nail art trend. Don’t believe us? Ask J Lo. Earlier this month, the singer’s nail artist showcased her latest look which featured fresh nude nails with intricate gold nail art on her ring finger adorning the letters J and B, for Jennifer and Ben (Affleck, her fiancé). ‘If you know… then you know,’ her nail artist, Tom Bachik, wrote in the caption. ‘Jennifer and Ben forever #couplegoals.’ J Lo wasn’t the first celeb to rock the boyfriend mani. In fact, the term was coined by Vogue after Kim Kardashian herself took to Instagram to show off her very own Barbie pink boyfriend manicure, which she wore to her sister Kourtney’s wedding. In line with the Y2K resurgence, Kim embellished her coffin-shaped nails with a diamante P, again on her ring finger, a sure nod to her new boyfriend, comedian Pete Davidson. This is perhaps the chicest, not-so-subtle way to show your partner how much they mean to you. We’re definitely here for the boyfriend manicure. Do you have a story to share?
