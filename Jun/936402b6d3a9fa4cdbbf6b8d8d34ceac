This is the moment a 52-year-old homeless woman was thrown onto subway tracks by a man who then ran off. The pair are believed to have had an argument in the run-up to the incident, but the suspect – Theodore Ellis – says he could not remember what she had said that had angered him so much. He also said he was not aware of this strengthy. Footage shows him approaching the woman at Jackson Avenue station the Bronx, New York, at around 4.45pm on Sunday. He grabbed her with both hands and threw her onto the platform but she ended up falling backwards onto the tracks. Thankfully there was no train approaching and she was helped back up witnesses. The victim was taken to Lincoln Hospital after suffering cuts to her head and arm. Ellis was arrested yesterday on charges of assault and reckless endangerment. A recent Seina Poll showed that seven in 10 New Yorkers feel less safe than they did before the coronavirus pandemic, and that 76% are worried they could be targets of a crime. New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Tuesday tried to downplay those figures, saying that shooting and homicide numbers are falling. ‘The feeling of being safe and the actualizing of being safe are not the same feeling,’ said Adams. But Bronx resident Cassie Perez said she gets ‘nervous’ about riding the subway. ‘You see people get close and I’ll back up. I always remind her, stay back,’ she told CBS 2, appearing to talk about a loved one. ‘Stay close to wall, don’t leave me, and things like that.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
