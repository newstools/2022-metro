This is the horrific moment a swinging fairground ride in Turkey snapped in mid-air. Children were heard screaming in panic as the pendulum-style ride crashed on the ground, landing upside down. Footage filmed at Ataturk Park, in south-western Turkey, on Saturday shows the youngsters laughing and smiling moments before the seating section broke away. Onlookers rushed to help those trapped under the metal structure but they couldn’t be freed until the firefighters arrived. It was a miracle no one died in the ‘freak accident’ but three 11-year-olds were taken to hospital with injuries. ‘While we were swinging, a cable or something broke,’ one child told local media. ‘The ride flew through the air and landed upside down. I hit my head and I also have bruising on my foot.’ It is yet unclear what caused the malfunction but park authorities are working to remove the dangerous attraction. Accidents on theme park rides like this are exceedingly rare but when they happen, there are often fatalities. Last month marked 50 years since the rollercoaster disaster in Battersea, south London. Largely forgotten today, 31 people were on board when tragedy struck. Two teenage boys and an eight-year old girl died at the scene, and two other children died due to the severity of their injuries. Last year also saw a rollercoaster in Scotland derail, leaving eight people injured. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
