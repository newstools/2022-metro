Some showers in Parliament and a tea point area have been closed following the discovery of legionella bacteria, the House of Commons authorities have said. They have been shut as a ‘precautionary measure’ after ‘low levels’ of the bacteria were discovered during routine monitoring by maintenance staff. Some ‘isolated areas’ of the building are affected and a disinfection of the water system in those parts of the building has been carried out, according to a spokesperson. Other water sources in the building remain safe to use. Legionella bacteria is naturally present in water systems and it can cause legionnaires’ disease, which is fatal in 10% of cases. It causes serious illnesses in people over the age of 50, those with underlying health conditions and smokers. The House of Commons spokesperson said: ‘As part of our routine proactive monitoring, our maintenance team have identified low levels of legionella bacteria in some isolated areas in Portcullis House. ‘As a precautionary measure in line with best practice, we have temporarily closed the showers and a tea point affected, while we undertake a disinfection of the water system in line with normal protocols. ‘All other water sources in the building continue to be safe to use as normal.’ The Palace of Westminster, where the two houses of Parliament meet, has long been beset with several problems such as fires, vermin and flooding. The building is in need of restoration. Portcullis House – the modern part of the building – was opened in 2001 to provide MPs and their staff with more office space.
