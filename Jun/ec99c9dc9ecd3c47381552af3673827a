Four people have died and three others are critically injured from a car crash involving an alleged migrant smuggling operation in Texas. It occurred on Interstate 35 in Encinal, which is about 40 miles north of the US-Mexico border. ‘The driver suspected of human smuggling evaded law enforcement and crashed into a commercial vehicle,’ tweeted the Texas Department of Public Safety’s (DPS) South Texas Region late Thursday morning. DPS spokesman Lt Chris Olivarez tweeted that four immigrants were confirmed deceased, that two others were in critical condition, and that the ‘driver/smuggler has been airlifted’ to a hospital. ‘This is the 2nd deadly human smuggling event within 24hrs resulting in the deaths of 6 immigrants,’ Olivarez wrote. The crash happened three days after 53 migrants that were being smuggled into the US were discovered dead inside of a tractor-trailer in San Antonio. Homeland Security Investigations officials have called it the deadliest human smuggling incident in American history. Police officers on Monday found the abandoned trailer in the outskirts of the city, with some victims believed to be younger than 18 years old. Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras are working with the US to try to identify the victims. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
