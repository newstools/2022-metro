Binley Mega Chippy has become so popular the police are telling the hordes of Gen Z customers to be ‘considerate’ of people living nearby. The internet’s favourite chip shop in Coventry has ten times its usual trade after a diehard fan posted a tribute video on TikTok, featuring an annoyingly catchy jingle. It has even been likened to Mecca as people travel from as far as Australia to sample the famous £4.99 Morbius meal deal — fish and chips, mushy peas and a can of pop. But with jubilant queues consistently stretching round the block, neighbours have got onto police to control the once-quiet area. Officers from West Midlands Police are now asking customers to drive and park safely, keep noise to a minimum and use the bins provided. Council workers and the local neighbourhood watch have also been roped in to monitor the chip-hunting youths. Metro’s very own Josh Layton went down to the chippy to see what the fuss was all about. Before waiting an hour for ‘perfectly golden’ chips, he found a ‘good-natured buzz’ among the Gen Z clientele, a ‘faint whiff’ of cannabis and ‘roaring engines’ in the car park.
