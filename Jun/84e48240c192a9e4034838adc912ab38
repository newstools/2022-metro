May might be over, but you know what isn’t? Hay fever season. With grass pollen levels peaking in June in what’s predicted to be a particularly bad year for hay fever sufferers, we’ve got a whole lot more snuffling to do. But don’t worry, you don’t have to spend the entire summer with your eyes and nose streaming. If you’re struggling to find antihistamine tablets, there are other products out there to soothe those irritating symptoms. Many of them use natural hay fever-fighting ingredients like nettle, eyebright and spirulina. So it’s kind of like nature fighting nature. Pretty cool, right? Here are the ones to buy: Smoothing a balm around the rim of your nostrils and eye bones traps pesky pollen before it causes a reaction. Buy for £7.49 for 5ml from Boots. Nettle is a natural antihistamine so make tea from nettle tops (a few sprigs steeped in a pot of boiled water) or buy bags and drink three times a day. Buy for £2.59 for 20 from Holland & Barrett.
