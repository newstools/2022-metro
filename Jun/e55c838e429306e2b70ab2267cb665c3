At least four people have been killed and dozens injured in a train crash in southern Germany. The regional service derailed north of the Garmisch-Partenkirchen ski resort in Bavaria, leaving a number of carriages lying on their sides, according to Bild. Half the train’s 60 passengers were hurt in the accident, with 15 of those requiring hospital treatment. A major rescue operation is underway, with a federal police spokesperson saying: ‘People are being pulled through the windows.’ Bavaria’s governor Markus Söder said he was shocked and saddened by the disaster. The train had been busy at the time of the crash shortly after midday on Friday, with many students said to be travelling on the last day of school before the holidays. ‘We grieve with the relatives of the victims and wish all who were injured a speedy recovery,’ Mr Söder said. ‘The students in particular were looking forward to the holidays. Lots of respect and thanks to the rescue services for their swift help.’ Pictures on social media showed carriages of a double-decker regional train stuck between tree branches and rolled down an embankment, as well as people being carried away on stretchers and standing around on the tracks. A major emergency services operation is underway and the rail line is currently completely closed. Prosecutors and police have launched an investigation into the cause of the accident, the official said. No information was given on the indentities of the dead or whether the driver was among the casualties. Regional trains have seen higher passenger numbers since June 1, when a ticket allowing Germany-wide travel came into effect. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
