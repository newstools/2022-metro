The body of a 16-year-old boy has been pulled from a river after he walked in and got into difficulty. Police officers were called to Jubilee River in Taplow, Buckinghamshire on June 24 at 5.30pm. A man had entered the water to try and rescue the boy before emergency services arrived. Thames Valley Police also confirmed Buckinghamshire and Berkshire fire and rescue services as well as South Central Ambulance Service launched an ‘extensive search’ with the help of the National Police Air Service. The teenager’s body was found in the water at 6.40pm and was then recovered. Police said the death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious and a file will now be prepared for the coroner. Formal identification has not yet taken place but the boy’s next of kin have been informed. Superintendent Emma Burroughs, local policing area commander for south Buckinghamshire, said: ‘This is a complete tragedy and my thoughts are with the family and friends of the boy who has died as a result of this incident. ‘We are in the early stages of investigating this incident, but do not believe there to be any suspicious circumstances. ‘There was a swift response from all emergency services, but very sadly, following an extensive search of the river, the boy was located deceased at around 6.40pm. ‘This has been an extremely traumatic and upsetting incident, and despite the best efforts of emergency services at the scene we were unable to rescue the boy, who was with two friends at the time. ‘I am aware that a member of the public entered the river shortly after the boy got into difficulty, but was unable to locate him. ‘I would like to commend him for his courage and bravery. ‘My sincere condolences are with the boy’s family and friends, and I would ask that their privacy is respected at this incredibly traumatic and distressing time for them.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
