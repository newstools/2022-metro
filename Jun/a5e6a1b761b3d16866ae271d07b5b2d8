Half of all lines will close altogether when rail workers go on strike next week. With pay talks failing to produce a breakthrough, industrial action is expected to cause havoc between June 20 and 26. Network Rail said it would publish a special timetable on Friday but with five days to go until the first walkout, it has moved to confirm mass cancellations will be required. The worst disruption is expected on June 21, 23 and 25, when RMT members will down tools in protest over pay and conditions. Only around half of Britain’s rail network will be open on strike days, with a very limited service running on lines that will only be open from around 7.30am until 6.30pm. No passenger services will serve locations such as Penzance in Cornwall, Bournemouth in Dorset, Swansea in South Wales, Holyhead in North Wales, Chester in Cheshire and Blackpool, Lancashire. There will also be no passenger trains running north from Glasgow or Edinburgh. Passengers are warned to expect continued disruption on June 22, 24 and 26, when the network will be fully reopened but on a reduced timetable. Andrew Haines, Network Rail chief executive, said: ‘Talks have not progressed as far as I had hoped and so we must prepare for a needless national rail strike and the damaging impact it will have. ‘We, and our train operating colleagues, are gearing up to run the best service we can for passengers and freight users next week despite the actions of the RMT.’ This is a breaking news story, more to follow soon… Check back shortly for further updates.
