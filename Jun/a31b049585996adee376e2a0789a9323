Things are about to get a whole lot sweeter in London this Friday. Canadian institution Tim Hortons is opening up its first branch in the capital on July 1 – and we were lucky enough to get a sneak peek inside. News that the hit chain, known for its coffee and doughnuts, would be opening its first branch in London broke earlier this year. And the good news is that all the customer favourites (we’re looking at you French vanilla and the Tims Crispy Chicken Sandwich) are on offer – as well as some new additions. The site, based in Royale Leisure Park, in West London, boasts breakfast, lunch and dinner options – as well as coffees, coolers and shakes. In total, the venue has space for 100 guests to dine in – but there’s also an option for people to drive-thru, for anyone who would prefer to take away. Tim Hortons also has UK sites elsewhere in the country, but this is the first for London – and there are plans for more to follow very soon. As for the menu, there are burgers, hot dogs, toasted melts, wraps, fries and more – as well as every doughnut flavour you could possibly ask for.
