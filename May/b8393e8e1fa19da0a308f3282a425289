This is the distressing moment a postman was caught on camera ‘kicking’ a small family dog after it allegedly nipped him. Footage from a doorbell camera showed the Royal Mail employee delivering a package to the home in Greater Manchester when the animal ran towards the open door. Moments later, the man suddenly yells and appears to kick the dog which tumbles across the driveway. The animal then gets up and runs off as the postman leaves the property. Following the incident, the teenage girl who opened the door to the postman was left in tears, her mum said. ‘My dog is terrified of going to the door and when the doorbell goes, he wets himself and is visibly shaking,’ the mum said, adding she made a formal complaint to Royal Mail. ‘My daughter answered the door for the delivery. I was outside hanging washing up and she ran in and told me what had happened. ‘My daughter was very upset. She was crying her eyes out and she’s not an emotional kid.’ It is understood the postman told his employers this was not a ‘deliberate kick’. The animal nipped him and this was a reflex reaction. In a letter seen by the Manchester Evening News, Royal Mail have apologised to the family for the upset caused. But the company pointed out that some 33 workers are attacked by dogs every week suffering small nips but also life-changing injuries. ‘We wish to again express our regret and offer our apologies once more for the upset, especially to your young daughter,’ the letter said. ‘Royal Mail staff are family people, with cats, dogs and other pets and we fully appreciate what a huge part of a home they are. ‘We work closely with our health and safety team to ensure our staff are fully aware of the dangers of loose animals.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted Royal Mail for further comment.
