Jesse Lingard’s brother has called Manchester United ‘classless’ over their decision to leave the midfielder on the bench in what is likely to be his final home game for the club. The 29-year-old has started just two games in the Premier League this season and was named on the bench once again for United’s match against Brentford at Old Trafford on Monday evening. United, who were playing at Old Trafford for the final time this season, sealed a 3-0 victory with goals from Bruno Fernandes, Cristiano Ronaldo and Raphael Varane. But Ralf Rangnick decided not to bring on Lingard in the second half and left the midfielder as an unused substitute. Lingard, who was signed by United’s academy when he was nine years old, is set to leave the club at the end of the season when his contract expires. And his brother, Louie Scott, delivered a scathing analysis of United after their win over Brentford. ’20 years of blood sweat and tears, 4 domestic trophies, 3 cup final goal, not even a farewell. No wonder it’s Conference League next year,’ Scott wrote in a post on Instagram. ‘Attacking players for celebrations when the clubs being sold to the Super League ok. ‘Class of 92, Busby Babes, you’re ran by people who don’t even know the offside trap. Classless and the fans need to realise. Goodnight, godbless! ‘Been there since nine years of age and didn’t even get a send off!!! Well done bro your family are proud.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
