A schoolgirl has died after she was hurt in a horrific accident at a David Lloyd gym in Luton. The child was hurt outside the venue’s club room around 8pm on Thursday and died later that evening in hospital. It is not known how old she was, but unconfirmed social media reports suggest she was nine. Paramedics and police rushed over to Capability Green Business Park, but despite their best efforts, the girl could not be saved. Luton Borough Council and the police are now investigating the incident, along with the Health and Safety Executive – which oversees welfare in workplaces. In a statement, David Lloyd Leisure said: ‘It is with deep regret that a young child was injured in an incident outside the Clubroom of our Luton club on Thursday and later died in hospital. ‘Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family at this time. ‘The club is closed, and we are working closely with the relevant authorities while they investigate.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
