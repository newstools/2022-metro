Time to amp up your al fresco dining game, as one of the nation’s favourite pizza ovens has just been restocked. The Wood Fired Pizza Oven & Pizza Stone, from Wowcher, costs just £99.99 too – making it far cheaper than its competitors. Ooni pizza ovens are also hugely popular – but they go for an additional £149, making them a far more costly purchase. Therefore, this Wowcher option can get you more bang for your buck, which matters all the more now given the crisis the nation faces over the cost of living. It’s an investment item, but it will produce restaurant-quality pizzas time and time again. Shoppers looking for a bargain have already raced to buy this oven, making it a sell-out in the past. As a result, it’s more than likely it’ll sell out again – so you may want to move fast. The oven has foldable legs so it can stand on its own, or be placed on top of another surface. It’s also ideal for those with limited outdoor space, given it’s fairly compact. There’s a fuel tray at the back, a chimney top, and a detachable door to help control the temperature. All you have to do is make or pre-buy a dough or base, then load on your toppings and slide it onto the pizza stone, which will cook the pizza in minutes. Keep in mind, though, that you might also need to invest in a peel to make sliding in the pizza easier. It’s the stuff summer outdoor dining dreams are made of. This article contains affiliate links.
