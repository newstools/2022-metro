A teenager has been arrested after a schoolboy died earlier today in Wolverhampton. Police believe the 15-year-old was stabbed to death. The victim was found injured near a canal bridge on Reapers Walk in the suburb of Pendeford at around 4.15pm. Paramedics battled to save him but he later died of his injuries. His family have been informed of the ‘devastating news’, a West Midlands Police spokesperson said. A 16-year-old boy from the area was arrested shortly before 7pm. Detectives also arrested a 46-year-old woman on suspicion of assisting an offender. A statement from the investigating force said: ‘We’re working hard to understand exactly what happened but at this time we believe the boy was stabbed. ‘Our thoughts are with the boy’s family and friends whose lives have been forever changed.’ A cordon has been placed at the scene and the force is speaking to witnesses and reviewing CCTV. It comes in the same week Merseyside Police were forced to issue a stark warning to youths in Liverpool over knife violence. A teenager narrowly avoided serious injury after being knifed a few streets from where Ava White died. The latest Liverpool stabbing attack came 24 hours after a teenager was told to expect a life sentence for murdering 12-year-old Ava in November 2021.
