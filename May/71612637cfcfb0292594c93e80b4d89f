Ahead you’ll find my super easy recipe for three-ingredient egg and peas cheesy waffles. Whether you’re in need of a speedy savoury breakfast, a tasty lunch, or a simple snack, this recipe is ideal for both children and adults. Feel free to swap up the vegetables to one that works for you – little broccoli florets could be super tasty – then make these for lunchboxes, picnics, and whatever other occasion you fancy. The waffles are ideal for little hands, and add some fun to what’s a pretty basic concoction. But if you don’t have a waffle iron, don’t panic – you can use the same ingredients to make little cups in a muffin tray.
