Burnley have been relegated to the Championship after their defeat to Newcastle United at Turf Moor. The Clarets started the day on level points with Leeds United but they had a superior goal difference. However, Callum Wilson’s penalty after twenty minutes in Lancashire meant the Clarets slipped into the bottom three and Raphinha’s spot kick put a three-point gap between the two sides at one point. Wilson got a second for the Magpies to further condemn the Clarets but Sergi Canos equalised for Brentford, meaning Burnley needed to find an equaliser to stay in the Premier League. Maxwell Cornet gave the home side hope when he halved the deficit but the Clarets couldn’t find an all-important second. Canos’ red card with nine minutes left gave Leeds a man advantage and Jack Harrison scored in the 94th minute to ensure Jesse Marsch’s side remain in the division. Burnley parted with legendary manager Sean Dyche last month in a desperate bid to turn their season around but despite an initial bounce from Mike Jackson, the Clarets’ failure to beat Aston Villa over two fixtures in the last fortnight proved costly.
