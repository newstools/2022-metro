The UK has ordered more than 20,000 doses of a vaccine to fight the spread of monkeypox. It is a smallpox vaccine called Imvanex, which contains a live modified form of the vaccinia virus called ‘vaccinia Ankara’, which is related to smallpox but not exactly the same. The UK Health Security Agency tweeted today: ‘UKHSA has procured over 20,000 doses of a safe smallpox vaccine (called Imvanex, supplied by Bavarian Nordic) as part of our rapid response to rising #monkeypox cases. ‘This vaccine is being offered to identified close contacts of people diagnosed with monkeypox to reduce the risk of symptomatic infection and severe illness. ‘If you suspect you might have rashes or lesions on any part of your body, particularly if you have recently had a new sexual partner, limit your contact with others and contact NHS 111 or your local sexual health service – please phone ahead before attending in person.’ This is a breaking news story, more to follow soon… Check back shortly for further updates.
