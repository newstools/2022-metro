Father’s Day is coming up on Sunday June 19, which means you’ve only got a few weeks left to find the perfect present. If you’re on a budget but still want something to impress your favourite male role model, this watch may be just the thing. By timepiece brand Ice, the watch is in gold-toned stainless steel with a blue dial and white and gold accents. The medium faced model would normally cost you £169, but in a flash deal from Amazon you can get you hands on it for just £32.20. That’s a whopping 81% discount on the RRP – although we won’t tell dad if you won’t. Like many of Amazon’s offers, the price drop will only be in place for a limited time. The deal may end today or when a certain number of people have purchased, so get ordering ASAP if your heart’s set on this gift. This model is water-resistant up to 10 ATM, so suitable for swimming and safe from any downpours or unexpected splashes. It also comes with a presentation box for gifting, and Prime members will get free next-day delivery and returns. Buy for £32.20 at Amazon now.
