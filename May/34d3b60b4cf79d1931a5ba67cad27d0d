What if we told you that rather than scrambling around for a deposit to get a mortgage, you could just buy a house outright for £5,000? It’s true… but there’s a big catch. A three-bedroom property on Pine Street in Stanley, County Durham, is on the market for £5,000 through an auction. But before you get too excited, take a peek inside. There’s a lot of work to be done. Photos show interiors that look like they haven’t been touched in decades, with gloriously retro printed carpets, slightly dingy wallpaper, and a pink bathroom (which we actually kind of love). All this means that the house has bags of potential, but if you’re after a modern, sleek design, you’ll need to do a lot of DIY work. But let’s focus on that potential. The house has one living room, a kitchen, three bedrooms, and a downstairs family bathroom. There’s a rear garden, and there’s potential for an extension to the rear, subject to planning permission. It’s ideally located, around 5 miles away from Chester-le-Street station for easy transport around the UK, and just a 20-minute drive from the city of Durham. If you fancy putting in a bid, you can find out more through the Zoopla listing. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
