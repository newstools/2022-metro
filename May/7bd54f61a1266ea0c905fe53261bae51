Heartbroken mourners consoled one another at a memorial service for the 19 children and two teachers killed in the Texas massacre. Floral tributes were laid by the fountain of the Uvalde town square – a mile away from Robb Elementary School – along with 21 crosses for each victim. Most of Uvalde’s 16,122 residents knew at least one person who died in the shooting. Each cross had a pink balloon tied to the ground, and were surrounded by stuffed animals, written letters and candles. They also had blue hearts glued to them so loved ones could remember them with kind words. Chalk messages were written along sidewalks in the town quoting Bible verses on love, compassion and eternal life and the names of the victims. A motorcade also drove through the town with heartfelt messages written on car windows, including one that read: ‘Our hearts are with Uvalde TX.’ Another local school, Crossroads Academy High, had a message of support displayed saying: ‘UVALDE STRONG.’ President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will meet with families affected by the mass shooting at the Texas elementary school on Sunday. It will be their second trip in as many weeks to comfort a community in mourning after the president went to Buffalo, New York, to meet with families and condemn white supremacy after a shooter killed 10 Black people at a supermarket. The shootings in Texas and New York and their aftermath have put a spotlight on the nation’s entrenched divisions and its inability to forge action to reduce gun violence. ‘Evil came to that elementary school classroom in Texas, to that grocery store in New York, to far too many places where innocents have died,’ Biden said at the University of Delaware on Saturday. ‘We have to stand stronger. We must stand stronger. We cannot outlaw tragedy, I know, but we can make America safer.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
