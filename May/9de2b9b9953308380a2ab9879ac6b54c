An earthquake has been detected in the Pacific Ocean, about 600 miles off the coast of New Zealand. The 6.7 struck quake happened in the Macquarie Island region, a remote area to the south of Australia. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said it happened more than miles below ground. It also revised the initial magnitude down from 7.3. No immediate tsunami warning has been put in place following the quake. The quake happened close to to an island designated a Unesco world heritage site in 1997. Officially part of Tasmania, Macquarie Island is home to a few dozen researchers and hundreds of thousands of royal penguins. It’s the second earthquake to have been detected in the region today. Tremors measuring 6 on the Richter scale were felt in the sea about 24 kilometres south-east of Hihfo, Tonga. According to the USGS, it was at a depth of 91 miles.
