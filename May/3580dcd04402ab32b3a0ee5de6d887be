Dame Deborah James has shared that she’s embracing the rain, saying that she doesn’t know when the last time she’ll feel it will be. The star, also known as Bowelbabe, recently revealed she’s receiving end of life care following a battle with bowel cancer, and launched a fundraiser which has surpassed £6million in donations for Cancer Research UK. Sharing a ‘thought of the day’, Dame Deborah, 40, filmed the rain outside. ‘A late friend once told me to embrace the rain, because you never know when the last time you’ll feel the rain on your face is…… so am embracing it!’ she wrote, adding: ‘Albeit with blankets!’ It has since been a whirlwind few days for the 40-year-old author, who has bravely shared her devastating ordeal with the public, while also receiving a Damehood from Prince William personally, after the Duke of Cambridge paid a visit to her parents’ home in Surrey where she has chosen to die surrounded by loved ones. Most recently, the fundraiser she started for Cancer Research UK shot past £6million in donations, a whopping 2500% more than her target amount of £250,000. Dame Deborah is married to banker Sebastien Bowen and is mother to two children, Hugo, 14, and Eloise, 12. In her final interviews, she expressed her wishes for Sebastien to move on and find love after her death, and revealed she has created memory boxes of messages and gifts for her children’s future milestones, such as getting married and big birthdays. The BBC podcaster was diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in 2016 and has had at least 17 operations to remove surgeries. Dame Deborah’s supporters have closely followed her journey for the past five years, notably through her You, Me & The Big C podcast which she began in 2018.
