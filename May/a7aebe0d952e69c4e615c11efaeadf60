The owner of a flat which burned down on Sunday morning is being hunted after twelve dead dogs and a cannabis farm were discovered in the wreckage. Emergency services were called to the property in Leigh, Greater Manchester, just after 9am and took several hours to get the blaze under control. Two neighbours suffered smoke inhalation as fumes started to spread next door, and were treated at the scene. The flat’s resident was nowhere to be seen. It has since been confirmed that the animals, which included two adult dogs and 10 puppies, died as a result of the fire. Efforts are also being made to trace the owners of the puppies, which may not have all belonged to the resident. Detectives described the cannabis farm as ‘small’. Chapel Street, where the property is located, as well as Warrington Road and Astley Street were closed off for several hours but have since reopened. A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police said ‘enquiries are ongoing and no arrests have been made’. A spokesperson for the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said their crews needed three hose reels to tackle the blaze and were in attendance for just over four hours.
