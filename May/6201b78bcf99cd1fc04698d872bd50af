Britney Spears has jetted off on a babymoon with fiance Sam Asghari, enjoying some fun and frolics before they welcome their first child. The Womanizer singer and fitness trainer-turned-actor are currently sunning themselves in Cabo and wasted no time in getting stuck into the water sports on offer. This week, they were spotted looking ready for action on the beach as an instructor rallied around Britney, 40, to help with her life jacket, before Sam, 28, hopped on his jet ski and whizzed through the choppy waters. At one point, the pop star looked distracted while waiting for her turn as she gently touched her growing baby bump. Britney eventually made it onto the jet ski and had company, as a female friend was seen sitting on the back of hers while gripping the singer around the waist. It’s the first time Britney and Sam have been pictured out together since announcing they were expecting their first child together. The Toxic singer shared the joyful news in a fairly cryptic Instagram post in April, describing her growing bump as a ‘food baby’. ‘I lost so much weight to go on my Maui trip only to gain it back 🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️🤷🏼‍♀️ … I thought “Geez … what happened to my stomach ???” My husband said “No you’re food pregnant silly 🤪 !!!”’ she began the announcement. ‘So I got a pregnancy test … and uhhhhh well … I am having a baby 👶🏼 … 4 days later I got a little more food pregnant 🤰🏼🙈🙈🙈 It’s growing !!! If 2 are in there … I might just lose it.’ Britney went on to discuss how she experienced perinatal depression when she was previously pregnant with her sons Sean Preston, 16, and Jayden James, 15, who she shares with ex-husband Kevin Federline, 44. ‘I have to say it is absolutely horrible 😔 … women didn’t talk about it back then … some people considered it dangerous if a woman complained like that with a baby inside her … but now women talk about it everyday,’ she continued. ‘Thank Jesus we don’t have to keep that pain a reserved proper secret 🤫 😬😬😬 … This time I will be doing yoga 🧘‍♀️ every day !!! Spreading lots of joy and love 💕 !!!’ Earlier this week, Britney gave her millions of followers an eye-popping look at her naked body as she shared a revealing snap on Instagram while remembering her body before she was pregnant.
