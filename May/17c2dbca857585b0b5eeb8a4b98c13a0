A 14-year-old schoolboy was raped in public toilets at Bournemouth Pier, just yards away from beachgoers enjoying the sunny weather. The child was attacked between 8.30am and 8.45am on Saturday, but the alarm was raised later in the afternoon. Police arrested a 51-year-old man on suspicion of rape and will be stepping up patrols in the area this spring and summer to put visitors at ease. ‘We are doing all we can to support the victim in this case and his family is being kept fully updated,’ Detective Ross Graham said. Chief inspector Darren Harris encouraged people to approach community support officers if they have any concerns. They can also speak to RNLI lifeguards, whose beach towers can be used as a safe place to seek help, he added. It follows another shocking incident at Bournemouth Beach in July last year when a 15 year-old girl was dragged into the sea and raped by a teenage boy in front of thousands of people. Police are continuing to investigate the incident and have issued several appeals for witnesses to come forward. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
