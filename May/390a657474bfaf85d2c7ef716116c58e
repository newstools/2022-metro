Fancy a property for £1.2million? There’s a bit of a catch: you can’t actually live in said property, because it’s a garage. But wait just a second – this isn’t as bad a deal as it might seem. For £1.2million, you’d get this 1960s garage in Newcastle… but you’d also get the full-sized tennis court that sits at the back. Plus, planning permission has been granted to build a three-storey detached house on the plot, which sits on Graham Park Road in Gosforth. So what’s a £1.2million garage now could turn out to be a dreamy property with its own tennis court or big garden. Lovely stuff. The estate agent’s blurb states: ‘An exciting opportunity to undertake a self-build project in the heart of Gosforth’s Conservation Area. ‘The tree-lined street of Graham Park Road often attracts the region’s higher-budget family buyers, drawn by the area’s fine late 19th century architecture, mature gardens and proximity to outstanding amenities and schools. ‘The plot extends to 760 square metres and has planning permission for a detached dwelling which will on completion would offer approximately 450m² of gross floor area across three levels.’ Sounds good to us.
