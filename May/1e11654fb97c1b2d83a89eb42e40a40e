With picnic season fast-approaching, there’s no denying that hummus is always a popular choice for an al fresco lunch in the park. But a brand new variety has just hit supermarket shelves. Heinz has just unveiled its own hummus – made with the brand’s beans, instead of chickpeas. The new Heinz Beanz Houmouz range currently features two flavours – an original version and a butternut squash variety – which are available on Ocado now for £2. In terms of ingredients, the original option blends haricot beans with roasted tomatoes, sesame tahini and extra virgin olive oil. Then is seasoned with lemon juice, garlic, cumin and topped with tomatoes. While the roasted squash one features the orange vegetable, tahini, olive oil, garlic, lemon juice and rosemary – and is topped with sunflower, pumpkin and sesame seeds. So both options are suitable for vegetarians and vegans, too. Heinz also plans to roll out a third flavour, chipotle chilli, later this year. Lucila Ardalla, new ventures irdector for Beanz Liberation at Kraft Heinz, commented: ‘We’re un-bean-lievably excited to be continuing our plant powered story by launching our very first Beanz Houmouz range, made using our iconic beans. ‘The result? A deliciously creamy and smooth texture unlike most traditional chickpea based hummus you’ve tasted before.’ Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
