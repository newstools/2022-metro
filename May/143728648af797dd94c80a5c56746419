We know, we know – we’re not supposed to play with our food. But let’s make an exception for this edible paint. Yep, paint that you can eat. It’s a very real thing that’s great for keeping kids entertained at the weekend – and, bonus, it’s super easy to make. You’ll need just two ingredients, some mixing power, and that’s it. Done. I did this with my son at the weekend and it was great – he ended up finger painting, so it was super easy to wash away. The great thing about this is if younger kids decide to lick their painting or their fingers (as they often do), the paint is completely edible. Less mess and a great way to do some colouring if you don’t have any proper paint to hand – hooray. Ready? Let’s get into the recipe.
