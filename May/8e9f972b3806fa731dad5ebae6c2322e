This is the shocking moment more than 20 mattresses fly off the back of a truck onto a busy motorway. The HGV was transporting the big pile of mattresses towards London on the M20 near Ashford in Kent. They appeared to be stacked properly in the cage, but the doors were not secured and the wind blew them open. Within seconds, the mattresses flew out, landing in front of other cars, which had to swerve to avoid them. ‘I had to go out into the fast lane to avoid them – they could easily cause an accident,’ one driver said. The chaos happened while the truck driver was overtaking in the middle lane. By the time the driver had crossed into the inside lane, there were just two mattresses left, with one hanging off the back. Dashboard cameras captured the sprawling mattresses from different angles. One clip shows the truck driver heading to the hard shoulder, presumably to pull over and deal with the mattresses. It comes after a lorry spilled 200 litres of diesel on the M20 on Tuesday, closing two lanes overnight. The accident badly damaged the road and it ended up needing resurfacing. National Highway workers have installed Operation Brock contraflow on the M20 – when cones are placed in a way that keeps traffic moving during disruption. This will stay in place until after the May Day bank holiday. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
