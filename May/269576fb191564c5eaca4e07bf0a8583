 A man has been arrested after allegedly kicking a kitten into the sea at a Greek restaurant. If charged and convicted of animal abuse, the man faces a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and a maximum €50,000 (£42,000) fine. Footage of the shocking incident shows three people dining outdoors at the seaside restaurant on the island of Evia. Two kittens approach them asking for food and one of the diners dangles a small fish by the edge, enticing it to come closer. When one kitten gets within inches from the side, it is kicked into the shallow waters below. A woman is heard laughing as the second kitten escapes. Locals reportedly took the kitten to a vet for examination and it was thankfully unharmed. The video sparked outrage on social media in Greece, leading to the arrest of the man. Greece’s police minister even hit out at the diner, saying ‘violence against animals is unacceptable’. ‘I cordially congratulate those who brought the matter to the public attention,’ Takis Theodorikakos said.
