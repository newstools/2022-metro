Whether you’ve changed sizes or simply need to upgrade your worn-out smalls, there’s no feeling like wearing brand new underwear. But it can get expensive. A couple of decent bras will normally set you back upwards of £100, and going for cheaper options is a false economy if you know you’ll need to replace it in the near future. Thankfully, M&S has come to our rescue with a new lingerie collection designed to be affordable and accessible. Prices in the B by Boutique range start art just £5, with bras priced from £12 each in a variety of styles and colours. Inspired by nineties shapes and featuring playful touches like animal print, the diffusion line includes crop tops, knickers, bras, and bodysuits. Bra cup sizes range from A to G and back sizes 30 to 40 are catered for. The rest of B by Boutique’s products are available in sizes extra small to extra large. M&S say customers can expect ‘comfy, contrasting fabrics, including delicate lace’ and ‘contemporary details with pretty finishing in sets that elevate the everyday.’ With prices like that, what’s not to love? Here are our favourite pieces from the new range, which you can pick up here. Get your hands on the M&S B by Boutique collection on the website or in selected stores.
