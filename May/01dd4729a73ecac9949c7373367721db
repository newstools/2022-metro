Jeremy Kyle shared way too much information on Thursday’s episode of The Talk, revealing to viewers that he didn’t wear underwear for 17 years. The TV presenter was prompted to deliver the overshare after hearing that guest star Mel B went knickerless to accept her MBE from Prince William at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday. ‘I actually genuinely didn’t wear underwear for 17 years,’ Jeremy proudly told the panel. ‘Why was that?’ a surprised Mel asked, causing Jeremy to reply: ‘I don’t know, I just didn’t fancy being straddled. Just hang free.’ Err, thanks for that nugget of information, Jeremy… Spice Girls singer Mel was honoured with a MBE on Wednesday for her services to charitable causes and vulnerable women. In 2018, she became a patron of the charity Women’s Aid, after she was allegedly the victim of domestic abuse at the hands of her former partner Stephen Belafonte – claims which Stephen denies. Last year, she also starred in a harrowing film portraying a domestic violence victim who fought to leave her abusive partner. The 46-year-old wore a striking red dress for the occasion, which was designed by her bandmate and bestie Victoria Beckham. However, what Prince William didn’t know was that Mel was ‘stark, b****ck naked’ underneath the ensemble. ‘Victoria asked me, “Will you wear nipple covers?” I said, “Why bother?”’ the singer told The Sun. She added: ‘‘When it came to the part where Prince William had to pin the MBE on, he asked for a female official to do it. I didn’t think I had that much cleavage on show!’ Got a story?
