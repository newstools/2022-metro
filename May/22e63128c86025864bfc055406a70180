Harry and Meghan will attend the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations next month with both of their children. It will be the first time Her Majesty will meet 11-month-old great-granddaughter Lilibet, who is named after her. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex confirmed on Friday, son Archie’s third birthday, that they were ‘excited and honoured’ to attend the commemorations for the monarch’s milestone in June. Their announcement was made minutes after Buckingham Palace revealed the couple will not appear alongside the Queen on the royal balcony for the Trooping the Colour. The lineup has been limited to working members of the royal family only. It is not known which elements of the four-day Jubilee weekend Harry and Meghan could make an appearance at. A spokeswoman for the couple said: ‘Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are excited and honoured to attend The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations this June with their children.’ It will be the first time Harry and Meghan have brought their family to the UK since leaving for the US. Lili’s first birthday falls during the Jubilee weekend on June 4 and she is yet to meet the Queen, the Prince of Wales and other members of the family. The monarch’s decision to only include royals carrying out official public duties was taken ‘after careful consideration’, Buckingham Palace said. The symbolic move by the Queen has been interpreted as a snub to Harry and Meghan, who quit the monarchy for a new life in the US two years ago, and to Andrew, who was cast out of the institution over his civil sexual assault case. On June 2, Trooping the Colour, the sovereign’s official birthday parade, will kick start the four days of Jubilee festivities, with 18 members of the royal family set to gather on the famous frontage, with the Queen ‘looking forward’ to the weekend of celebrations.
