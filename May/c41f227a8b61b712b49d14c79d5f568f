What do you usually do when your bread goes stale? If it’s not getting hands on and making a bread and butter pudding or cutting it up into croutons, it’s chucking it into the depths of your freezer to ‘use as toast’ or, worse, throwing it away. If we’re being honest with ourselves, none of these options are ideal – you’re torn between a time-consuming baking job, rubbish toast or waste. But, did you know you can actually revive stale bread in a matter of minutes? Meal-prepping pro and Australian influencer Katie Lolas shared a video to Instagram explaining how. The best part? It’s super simple. ‘All you have to do is pour water over the bread to ensure the crust is wet,’ the mum-of-one explains, over footage of her rinsing a loaf of bread under a tap. Next, simply place the bread in the oven on 160C for around six minutes. ‘There you go, your bread will be good as new – moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside,’ she says. It really is that easy. Although, Katie is quick to note that bread that has gone mouldy is completely past salvaging. ‘Throw it in your compost and move on,’ she says. The hack proved popular among commenters. ‘Witchcraft,’ one wrote. ‘That’s awesome,’ said another. ‘Will definitely be giving this a go!’ Others said the hack also works with individual sourdough slices as well as scones.
