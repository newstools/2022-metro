Tyson Fury has congrtulated Katie Taylor after the Irishwoman retained her undisputed lightweight title in thrilling fashion at Madison Square Garden. It was the fist time two women had headlined a card at one of the most prestigious venues in boxing history and both Taylor and her opponent, Amanda Serrano, put on a spectacular show. Ultimately, Taylor won by split decision and got the verdict on two cards, by 97-93 and 96-93 margins, with one judge scoring it 96-94 to Serrano. Dublin’s Croke Park has already been touted as a potential venue for a re-match and Taylor would jump at the chance to fight in front of her adoring fans. ‘Absolutely,’ said Taylor afterwards. ‘We have to do this again,” Taylor said after the result. ‘It was an absolute war for 10 rounds. I’m grateful to be in this position and sell out Madison Square Garden. Look what we’ve just done. ‘I said before that when you think Madison Square Garden, you think Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier, but now everyone will be thinking of Katie Taylor v Amanda Serrano. ‘I knew I was going to have to dig deep and go to the trenches. I have the heart as well as the skill. I knew I was going to be able to pull through. ‘She’s a phenomenal fighter. A great, great person. It was a privilege to fight her again.’ Fury, meanwhile, speaking a week after he announced his retirement following his emphatic victory over Dillian Whyte at Wembley, hailed both Taylor and her opponent for what was a titanic struggle. He said: ‘A big shoutout to Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano for a great, epic fight.’ MORE : Katie Taylor beats Amanda Serrano to defend lightweight titles in historic fight in Madison Square Garden MORE : ‘Make history again!’ – Conor McGregor sends message to Katie Taylor ahead of Amanda Serrano showdown For more stories like this, check our sport page.
