With the Platinum Jubilee weekend only days away, celebrations are already beginning. A four-day weekend is on the cards and people up and down the country will be making the most of it. And to kick off the festivities with a bang, one pub is doing something special for patrons to mark Queen Elizabeth’s 70 years on the throne. Greene King Local Pubs are offering pints of its fan-favourite IPA for just 6p on Monday 30th May. Yes, you heard us, 6p. This is the same price they were during the Queen’s 1952 coronation. For one day only, Greene King Local Pubs will be offering this royally tempting deal across its 408 sites. Anyone visiting a Greene King Local Pub or a Flaming Grill establishment on Monday will be able to claim a pint for just 6p by using the secret code word ‘1952’ at the bar. Andrew Gallagher, Marketing Director at Greene King Local Pubs, said of the initiative: ‘The Platinum Jubilee is a fantastic way for the U.K. to come together and celebrate our Queen and country, so we wanted to take our customers back to where it all began– 1952, a time when Vera Lynn ruled the charts and pints were only 6p. ‘Some of our regulars may even remember watching the coronation back in 1952, although they may have been too young to enjoy a pint then.’ So, start counting your pennies and we’ll see you down the pub on Monday.
