Jesse Lingard is open to signing a new contract at Manchester United following the appointment of Erik ten Hag, with the Dutchman set for talks with the midfielder over his future. Ten Hag was appointed on a three-year deal in April and he’s scheduled talks with each member of United’s first-team squad. Lingard, 29, is out of contract at the end of the season and he had been minded to leave Old Trafford, following a disappointing campaign where he’s barely featured under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer or Ralf Rangnick. But the England international has been encouraged by Ten Hag’s appointment according to the Sun, and feels that the Dutchman’s playing style could benefit him if he stays at the Theatre of Dreams. Ten Hag would certainly look favourably on Lingard’s energy levels and ability to chip in with goals from midfield and he’s open to keeping the midfielder. Nemanja Matic, Paul Pogba, Edinson Cavani and Juan Mata are all set to leave when their contracts expire at the end of the season and Ten Hag is wary of losing so much experience in one window. Of those with no time remaining on their deals, Lingard is best suited to Ten Hag’s methods and United will leave the call to the Dutchman. Marcus Rashford is similarly buoyed by Ten Hag’s appointment and believes the Dutchman’s hands-on coaching methods could help him to regain his confidence. The England forward was open to leaving United this summer following a difficult spell under Rangnick but he would ideally like to remain at his boyhood club for the rest of his career. The forward has lost his place in Gareth Southgate’s England squad and has been a shadow of his former self this season. However, it’s been made clear to Rashford that he will be given plenty of opportunities under Ten Hag and it’s a chance to start afresh.
