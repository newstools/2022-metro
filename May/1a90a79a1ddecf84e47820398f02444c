We’ve all seen the girls on TikTok doing their perfect blowdry with a Dyson Supersonic. We watch, we’re envious of their fringe technique, then rush to search out a Dyson dryer of our very own. Then, that sinking feeling arrives when we see the price tag. But what if you could get the same results for a fraction of the price? If you move fast, you can. The Shark Style iQ hairdryer hasn’t had the same hype as the Dyson, but it seriously deserves it. It’s lightweight, super speedy, and cuts down on the heat damage you’d typically get from blasting your hair with a dryer. And, lucky for us, it’s currently on sale. While usually you’d have to shell out £229.99, right now on Amazon it’s up for grabs for £149.99. Note: That’s half the price of the Dyson. Buy now for £149. The reviews are pretty glowing, too. One woman wrote: ‘Finally splashed out and bought one of these. It took me a couple of tries to learn how to use it best for my hair. ‘I have long, 2c/3a type curls and found that having the extendable prongs in the diffuser really helps target roots or ends specifically. ‘Cut my drying time in half and now only use low heat setting. Definitely happy with this hairdryer. ‘Added bonus of sounding like a spaceship.’ This article contains affiliate links.
