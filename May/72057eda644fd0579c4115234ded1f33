Saint-Etienne fans launched a pitch invasion with violent intent after watching their side be relegated from Ligue 1, throwing flares and attacking their own players after the match. The second leg of the relegation play-off with Auxerre finished 1-1, just as the first leg had, which meant the contest went to a penalty shootout. Ryad Boudebouz missed the opening spot-kick for the home side and that proved to be the difference as Auxerre netted all five of their penalties to send Saint-Etienne down to Ligue 2. Things turned very ugly as soon as Birama Toure scored his winning penalty, with Saint-Etienne fans rushing onto the pitch. The players and officials had to get off the pitch as quickly as possible as fans stormed the pitch and flares were thrown at players and staff as they tried to get down the tunnel. There were loud bangs heard as the violence ensued and some flares were even hurled into the stands, with smoke filling the air. French publication RMC Sport reported that tear gas was also thrown and that journalists and cameramen were struggling to deal with the smoke bombs let off. However, they did also report that security staff managed to clear the field of the pitch invaders, despite the chaotic scenes.
