Gogglebox star Andrew Bennett has been jailed for a sex attack on a teenage boy. The 47-year-old reality star, who featured in the 12th series of the Channel 4 show, was sentenced to 29 months in prison and ordered to sign the sex offenders register. It comes after Bennett cornered the teenage victim at a house and subjected him to an attack that left him ‘in tears’ and suffering flashbacks. The court was told that the attacker, who initially denied the assault, took selfies with the boy before cornering him at the property, while under the influence of alcohol. Bennett asked his victim if he was gay, which the teen said he wasn’t, but continued to pursue him. CPS North East’s Andrew Jones said: ‘Andrew Bennett forced himself upon his young victim, touching him inappropriately before attempting to incite him into further sexual acts. ‘During his first interview with police Bennett denied having touched his victim, claiming only to have spoken to the boy at the time of the alleged attacks, but then claimed that his behaviour had been affected by slimming tablets when further physical evidence was shown to him. ‘The Crown Prosecution Service has worked closely with police, piecing together forensic evidence and witness testimony to build a robust case, which has been instrumental in securing guilty pleas to all charges against the defendant. ‘Andrew Bennett carried out these attacks in a selfish pursuit of his own sexual gratification and the impact on this boy has been significant. ‘We sincerely hope that the sentence passed today provides some measure of comfort to him.’ Bennett appeared in one season of Gogglebox alongside his best friend Fawn.
