Things are incredibly expensive at the moment. We’re seeing prices for household bills, food, petrol and more soar up – alongside tax hikes and rising interest rates. And although everyone has felt the rising cost of living in one way or another, some families are struggling more than others. Many parents and guardians are having to make difficult decisions on what to spend their money on. But charities in East London have teamed up to offer some help. Hackney Baby Bank will be opening on May 23, offering all sorts of essential items such as clothes, shoes, toys and nappies. The centre will offer items for children up to the age of five – and is being funded by The Guinness Partnership, with Hackney charities Sal’s Shoes, Little Village and Boiler House Spaces running it. It’s come about at the right time too as, according to Trust for London, 48% of children in Hackney are currently living in poverty – compared to the London average of 37%. Alistair Smyth, director of external affairs at housing charity The Guinness Partnership, told Hackney Gazette: ‘More and more families are struggling financially right now. ‘They’re faced with really difficult choices about what to spend and how, or if they can make money go further. ‘And we’re talking about essentials here – housing, food, energy, clothes – the basics all families need.’ The baby bank will be located at Hackney Family Centre, just off Harrington Hill in Lower Clapton.
