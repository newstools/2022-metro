Last year, we were all thrown into a frenzy when Glossier leaked a 50% off discount code sitewide for two hours. The Slack chats and the WhatsApp groups were on fire – and so were our bank accounts, as we picked up as many products as we could in a hurry. The Metro.co.uk Lifestyle team even reviewed our entire haul – from Cloud Paint to perfume, Stretch Concealer to Futuredew. It was a truly great day. Some thought the leak was a mistake, others thought it was a marvelous publicity stunt. Either way, we appreciated the cheaper goods. To mark the anniversary of this unforgettable moment in beauty culture, Glossier will this week honour this joyous memory with another code for a summer ‘friends of Glossier’ sale. Before you get too excited, it’s not quite as good as last time. It’s a lower discount at 20% off, but it will run for five days – meaning you won’t have such a stressful half hour like panic buying everything like last time. It will also be valid on value sets, which already have a discount applied, so that 20% will go further. All you need to do is put FOG22 in the checkout between May 26 and 31. We’ll definitely be stocking up on our favourites – will you? Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
