The Duchess of Sussex has made no attempt to contact her dad since he suffered a stroke earlier this week, it has been claimed. Author Tom Bower, who told ITV’s Good Morning Britain she had not been in touch, said Meghan should show some ‘compassion’ after Thomas ­Markle was admitted to hospital in Mexico on Tuesday. The 77-year-old dad — estranged from his daughter since 2018, the year she married Prince Harry — is said to be unable to speak. But his other daughter Samantha, 57, said he was now ‘recovering’ after being transferred to a clinic in California. ‘He just needs peace and rest. Godspeed. We are praying,’ she told MailOnline. Tom, who is writing a book about 40-year-old Meghan, said he last spoke to Thomas at the weekend and was in contact with the family. He told GMB presenters Richard Madeley and Susanna Reid: ‘If we knew what she [the duchess] was going to do, that would be terrific. ‘But what we do know is that Meghan has always said she’s a very compassionate person. ‘And if compassion was at all necessary right now, it would mean she would go to her father’s bedside, about two-and-a-half hours’ drive south of where she lives, and give him some comfort and reassurance. ‘We wait to see what happens.’ Tom added: ‘We know she hasn’t [made any contact]. ‘There hasn’t been any contact since just before the wedding day — other than the famous letter.’ He was referring to a letter Meghan wrote to her dad three months after her May wedding. Thomas said last month that he planned to visit the UK in June for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. He said hoped to meet Prince Charles as he felt that they had ‘a lot in common’.
