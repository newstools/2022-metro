Festival season is nearly upon us, which means hordes of welly-wearing music fans will be descending on fields across Britain. Aside from the warm pints and dodgy toilets, the main issue with festivals is that they’re at the mercy of the weather forecast. If you pack shorts it’ll inevitably pour down, while lugging your thermals to your campsite is a surefire sign that it’ll be tropical. Seasoned festivalgoers will know the value of a light item that works for you whatever the weather – like a bucket hat. It’s a workhorse accessory, shielding you from rain and sun alike, so no sunburned noses or drowned rat hair to contend with. Plus, if you go for a jazzy one, you’ll be easy to spot if you get lost in the crowds. The high street is packed with these versatile hats right now, and we’ve picked out our favourite ones.
