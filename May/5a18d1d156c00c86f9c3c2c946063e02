Denise Van Outen’s former fiancé Eddie Boxshall’s replacement on Celebrity Gogglebox has been revealed after the couple split earlier this year. Blue’s Duncan James will be joining best pal Denise instead after she ditched Eddie following reports he had phone sex with another woman. Denise and the boyband star go way back so naturally Duncan was the perfect fit. ‘Denise and Duncan have been pals since they both shot to fame in the late 90s and he has been helping her through her painful break-up this year,’ an insider told The Sun. ‘As bezzies who share a similarly outrageous sense of humour, they have the perfect chemistry to deliver some laughs as they survey TV shows. ‘Just a few months ago they were performing together at [London night spot] Proud Cabaret. ‘She was wearing a mini dress while he donned a leather corset and fishnet stockings, though they’ll probably be wearing something a little more comfortable when they share the Gogglebox sofa.’ Denise recently opened up about her split from Eddie, and said she was ‘proud’ of herself for being brave enough to ‘walk away’. ‘I don’t like to be taken advantage of,’ she said during an appearance on Steph’s Packed Lunch. ‘I’ve always tried to maintain that in anything that I do in life, generally. ‘More so now as a mother because I feel like I’m a role model and I’ve got to set an example. ‘The bad times are always followed by good times and that’s what I always look forward to. ‘I think you just ride the wave of the bad times knowing that eventually you will get to a good place.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted a Celebrity Gogglebox spokesperson for comment on this story. Celebrity Gogglebox returns to Channel 4 later this year. Got a story?
