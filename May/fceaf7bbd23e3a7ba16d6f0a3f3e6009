The incredible moment a dog was reunited with her owner after more than two days buried underground was captured on video. Flossie can be seen poking her head out of the hole and into the sunshine as a man carefully digs her out. Although she is a little nervous about being pulled up onto the ground, when she actually gets free she is clearly delighted to reunite with owner Bracken Jelier, who had posted on Facebook trying to find where she could be. She suspected that Flossie might have gone rabbiting and found herself lost, and that turned out to be the case – though she only went as far the neighbour’s garden in Crediton. In her Facebook post, Bracken asked for help searching all the rabbit holes in the area, and another dog managed to sniff out where she got stuck. Video shows how she was found on Thursday afternoon and then rescued by a member of the Mid Devon Hunt – after being buried underground fro 56 hours. Bracken updated those anxious about her pet with another post on Facebook: ‘We are over the moon to say that Flossie has been found. ‘It’s a very long story with some unbelievable coincidences that lead to her being discovered after 56 hours buried underground. ‘We are incredibly pleased to have her home and other than being a little dehydrated and underweight she is absolutely fine.’ She added: ‘Thank you for all incredible messages. We have been overwhelmed by everyone’s support. We are also painfully aware that there are many people that never find their dogs. ‘So we will be forever grateful that we were some of the lucky ones.’ Sharing a photo of Flossie tucked up on a dog bed, she added: ‘As you can see, she has settled back into home very nicely indeed!’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
