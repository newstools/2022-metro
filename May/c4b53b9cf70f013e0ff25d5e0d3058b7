Mohamed Salah says Liverpool will be out for ‘revenge’ in their Champions League final against Real Madrid. Jurgen Klopp’s side survived a scare to beat Villarreal in the second leg of their semi-final this week. Madrid, meanwhile, staged a remarkable late comeback against Manchester City and dumped Pep Guardiola’s men out of the competition in extra time. Liverpool now have the chance to win their second Champions League trophy under Klopp, but they also have the opportunity to avenge their loss to Madrid in the 2018 final. The defeat was particularly hard on Salah, who was forced off in the first half due to a shoulder injury he suffered in a tussle with Sergio Ramos. ‘Well, I’m so excited, our team is so excited about it,’ Salah said after picking up his second Football Writers’ Association Football of the Year award on Thursday evening. ‘I said before the game that I wanted to play Madrid in the final, I’m sure it’s going to be a tough game. ‘They beat a lot of good teams, we just need to be focused on the game. ‘First of all we still have a few games in the Premier League, we have to finish them in the best way possible.’ When asked if the final is a chance for revenge, Salah replied: ‘Yeah, we lost in the final, it was a sad day for all of us. ‘It’s revenge time.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
