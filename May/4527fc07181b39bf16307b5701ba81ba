Families of victims of the condo collapse in Surfside, Florida, have reportedly agreed to a $997million settlement for loss of life and property. The settlement unveiled in a court hearing on Wednesday includes insurance companies, developers and defendants. The New York Times reported. It is pending final approval. The nearly $1billion settlement comes six weeks before the one-year anniversary of the Champlain Towers South collapse on June 24. ‘I’m shocked by this result – I think it’s fantastic,’ said Judge Michael Hanzman of the Circuit Court in Miami-Dade County. ‘This is a recovery that is far in excess of what I had anticipated.’ The judge had previously approved a smaller settlement of $83million to be shared among condo unit owners for property loss. However, the settlement grew after victims’ attorneys, contractors and consultants sued by the survivors, and developers of the luxury Eighty Seven Park building next door, joined the case. ‘We will be done. The money will be distributed. These victims will get some measure of relief,’ a lawyer for the plaintiffs, Harley Tropin, told the Miami Herald. The settlement could exceed $1billion if an agreement is reached with a remaining company, lawyers said. Both sides had hoped to resolve the case by the one-year anniversary of the collapse, Hanzman said. Breaking story, check back for updates…
