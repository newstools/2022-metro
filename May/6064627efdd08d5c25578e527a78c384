A woman was raped in her own home after meeting a man on Plenty of Fish. Michael Collins, 28, has been jailed for eight years after making contact with his victim online in 2016. A court heard how the Manchester man forced himself on the woman during a visit to her house. The pair spent the evening watching television together and kissed but she made it clear she did not want to have sex. Collins continued to touch her despite her protests, repeatedly sexually assaulting her before raping her. He labelled her ‘lazy’ and said: ‘For f**k sake, that took me an hour to get that out of you.’ Minshull Street Crown Court heard the victim thought he was picking her up to go on a date when he arrived at the house. The victim has suffered psychologically, the court heard, and felt she had to leave the home where the attack took place. She has suffered from anxiety since the incident, the prosecution said. Collins’ lawyer Richard Orme told the court his client, originally from Ireland, comes from a ‘family-focused’ community. Following the case, DC Martyn Bateman, of GMP’s City of Manchester CID, said: ‘Despite being told no, Collins forced himself upon this woman to satisfy his sexual desires. ‘Sexual offences often have a lifelong impact on victims but, hopefully, today’s result will provide her with a level of closure. ‘It is also my hope that this case builds public trust and confidence that, though these cases can take some time, GMP is committed to bringing offenders to face justice by launching thorough investigations which gather all evidence to secure the best possible outcome.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
