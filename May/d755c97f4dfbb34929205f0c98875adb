Newcastle United have been accused of hypocrisy after sending a message of support to gay footballer Jake Daniels. The Premier League club were bought by a Saudi-led consortium last October, a venture which has been branded a cynical ‘sportswashing’ project given the Gulf state’s human rights record and attitudes towards the LGBT community.
