Giovanni van Bronckhorst has defended Aaron Ramsey after his missed penalty cost Rangers in their Europa League final against Eintracht Frankfurt. The final went to extra time and then a penalty shootout after Joe Aribo’s opening goal was cancelled out by Rafael Borre in the second half. James Tavernier, Steven Davis, Scott Arfield all scored their penalties before Ramsey’s low effort was saved by Frankfurt goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. Borre then converted Frankfurt’s fifth penalty to secure the trophy for the Bundesliga club. Asked how the mood was in Rangers’ dressing room after the defeat in Seville, Van Bronckhorst said: ‘It’s very down, you can see that already after the game. ‘It’s never nice to lose and so everyone is hurt, disappointed, you can sense that in the locker room. I think it’s also normal so short after the game. ‘Aaron of course was disappointed. But he took responsibility to take the penalty. ‘You can make it or you can miss it. Unfortunately for us he didn’t make it but you want to have players taking penalty and who are comfortable also.’ Van Bronckhorst added: ‘I think we prepared well also for penalties. ‘In the penalty kicks some players are comfortable taking penalties. We had a few who were comfortable taking penalties and others who did not want to take one. ‘We had to adjust it because of the subs. Borna [Barisic] had to go out and he’s one of the first penalty kickers.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
