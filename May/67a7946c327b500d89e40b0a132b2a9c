Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, has branded Paris Saint-Germain an ‘insult to football’ after Kylian Mbappe rejected the opportunity to sign for Real Madrid. The France international’s contract was due to expire next month and he appeared destined to fulfil a childhood dream by signing for the Spanish giants. Real had a £200million bid rejected last summer but have been in constant contact with the 23-year-old during the course of the season and finally looked set to land Mbappe, having withdrawn from the race to sign Manchester City-bound Erling Haaland. The Champions League finalists have been rocked, however, by Mbappe’s late change of heart with the World Cup winner set to confirm his intention to pen a new three-year deal after tonight’s Ligue 1 match against Metz. Mbappe’s snub represents another blow to La Liga’s reputation having lost the pulling power of Lionel Messi, as well as Cristiano Ronaldo. Reacting to Mbappe’s decision, Tebas said: ‘What PSG’s doing by renewing Mbappe with large sum after giving losses of €700m in recent seasons and having more than €600m of salary bill, is an insult to football. ‘They are as dangerous as the Super League.’ Mbappe has been embroiled in intense negotiations with PSG’s Qatari owners over the course of the last week and appears to have won a major power struggle. Sporting Director Leonardo is now expected to be replaced by Luis Campos, who helped assemble the Monaco team at which Mbappe made his breakthrough as a teenager. Mauricio Pochettino, too, is likely to pay the price for another Champions League failure with Zinedine Zidane in line to replace the former Tottenham manager at Parc des Princes.
