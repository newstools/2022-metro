Wolves are seeking legal action against incoming Arsenal signing Marquinhos, according to reports in Brazil. The Gunners are understood to have agreed a £2.5 million deal with Sao Paulo, while the 19-year-old has signed a contract and travelled to London to complete his medical. Marquinhos had initially signed a five-year contract with Sao Paulo in 2019 but FIFA ruled that it was only valid for three years under normal regulations for players signing their first professional deal, which meant he would be free to sign for another club this year. According to Yahoo Sports Brazil, Wolves also held talks to sign Marquinhos and it’s claimed that the winger even signed a pre-contract agreement to join them on a free transfer when his deal expired with Sao Paulo. Wolves now believe Marquinhos has broken that agreement in order to join Arsenal and have approached a legal firm in Brazil to take action against the player. However, Sao Paulo are confident that Marquinhos’ move to Arsenal will go ahead despite Wolves’ protests. ‘Sao Paulo still hasn’t received the money from Arsenal, but it’s calm,’ a source at the Brazilian club told Yahoo Sports Brazil. ‘The agreement has legal guarantees and the player has already undergone medical examinations.’ Meanwhile, Sao Paulo have been criticised for allowing Marquinhos to leave the club for such a relatively small fee. ‘This is absurd. This is absurd,’ said former Brazil midfielder Vampeta. ‘They’re going to lose Marquinhos to Arsenal for £2.5m. I don’t know if you remember that I used to say I watched Audax’s academy games, Marquinhos in the under-15s, he used to already make the difference. I said here on the show, ‘there’s an under-15 at Sao Paulo, Marquinhos’, now he’s going to leave on a silver platter.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
