A cute family of fox cubs have decided a family garden in a built-up area is actually their personal playground. The six babies and their parents visit at any time of day, and bring various items with them to have fun with, including someone’s garden glove (hope they’re not missing it) and towel and even a pair of knickers. Steve Midgley captured some sweet photos of them at the urban garden in Halifax, West Yorkshire, saying they like to make a lot of noise. ‘The cubs are quite friendly,’ he said. ‘They know I’m there either in the hide or sat in my camouflage and can get very close. However, the adults are very shy and hardly emerge when I’m in the hide. ‘They live in a very built-up area surrounded by houses, but they’re a joy to sit and watch and to photograph.’ He said that the like to practice their pouncing as the mum drags a towel around while her babies chase it. The 59-year-old manager visits his friend’s garden to take the pictures. He said: ‘They do make a lot of noise especially when chasing each other or fighting over food. ‘Mum or dad seem to bring home things they find for the cubs to play with. We have picked up all manner of clothing from t-shirts and hats to socks and knickers. ‘You never know what you will find on the lawn in the morning.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
