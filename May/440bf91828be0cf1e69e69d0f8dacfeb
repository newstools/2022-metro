A serving Tory MP has been arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault offences, it has been reported. The man is in custody in the latest shock allegation to rock Westminster, according to The Sun. Chief Whip Chris Heaton Harris has asked the MP to stay away from Parliament during the probe. A whips office spokesperson said: ‘The Chief Whip has asked that the MP concerned does not attend the Parliamentary Estate while an investigation is ongoing. ‘Until the conclusion of the investigation we will not be commenting further.’ Police said the allegations relate to offence allegedly committed in London between 2002 and 2009. They first received a report of the allegations in January 2020 and have conducted a two-year investigation into the claims. Scotland Yard said: ‘A man was arrested on suspicion of indecent assault, sexual assault, rape, abuse of position of trust and misconduct in a public office.’ It is understood the Conservatives will not make a decision on whether the suspect has the whip suspended until after the police investigation is concluded. The arrest comes just a month after Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy and expelled from the party. Fellow Conservative David Warburton was also suspended following sexual harassment allegations, which he denies. It was reported last month that 56 MPs had been referred to parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme over sexual complaints. The list is said to  include three members of Boris Johnson’s cabinet and two shadow ministers, according to The Sunday Times. Got a story?
