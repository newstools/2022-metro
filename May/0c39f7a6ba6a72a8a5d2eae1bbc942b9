Have you ever wondered what camel meat tastes like? Well, wonder no more. Leeds based doner kebab eatery I am Döner has introduced a Camel Kebab special for this month only. To celebrate the opening of its first overseas store in Dubai, UAE, I am Döner will be serving up the Emirati delicacy, which comes with basmati rice and vegetables and topped with garlic mayonnaise, only on Wednesdays (Get it? Hump day?). Camel meat is often eaten on special occasions in some parts of the Middle East and is just as nutritionally good – or even better than – beef and lamb. In a nod to the new store, founder Paul Baron worked with a local food influencer to create the recipe using spiced, aromatic, slow cooked camel rump. Founded in 2016, the brand is known for its out of the ordinary specials, and once launched reindeer kebabs for Christmas, so camel meat is no big deal. ‘Having had so much interest in our other unconventional specials over the years, it was clear we needed to do something extra special to celebrate this big milestone in our development,’ said Baron. ‘On our recent trips to the desert, we were very inspired to find a way to bring camel to the menu here in the UK. ‘We’ll have to wait and see whether it will be our best idea yet, or just the effects of dehydration and too much sun!’ Do you have a story to share?
