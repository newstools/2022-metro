A nine-year-old who survived Tuesday’s mass shooting at Robb Elementary said the gunman entered the classroom and said ‘It’s time to die.’ ‘He shot the next person’s door. We have a door in the middle. He opened it. He came in and he crouched a little bit and he said, “It’s time to die,”‘ a boy who was in the classroom where the shooting took place said. Authorities say Salvador Ramos, 18, barricaded himself inside a classroom and opened fire, killing 19 children and two teachers before he was killed by law enforcement. ‘When I heard the shooting through the door, I told my friend to hide under something so he won’t find us,’ the boy said. ‘I was hiding hard. And I was telling my friend not to talk because he is going to hear us.’ The boy and four other fourth graders, who are generally 9 or 10-years-old, hid under a table that had a tablecloth draped over it, which may have shielded them from the gunman’s view. ‘When the cops came, the cop said: “Yell if you need help!” And one of the persons in my class said “help.” The guy overheard and he came in and shot her,’ the boy told KENS5. ‘The cop barged into that classroom. The guy shot at the cop. And the cops started shooting,’ the boy said. After the shooting stopped, he emerged from underneath the table. ‘I knew it was the police. I saw the armor and the shield,’ he said. The young boy said his teachers, Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles, saved their lives. Both Garcia and Mireles were killed by the gunman while shielding students from the attack. ‘They were nice teachers. They went in front of my classmates to help. To save them,’ he said. The boy added: ‘I would like to say to every kid and parent to be safe.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
