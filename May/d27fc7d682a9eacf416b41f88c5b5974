Meghan Markle’s dad Thomas left hospital last night, five days after suffering a major stroke ahead of his trip to the UK for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. It is understood the Duchess of Sussex has reached out to the retired Hollywood lighting director, who she reportedly cut ties with after her 2018 wedding. Meghan was due to fly to London for the royal celebrations alongside Prince Harry and their two children Archie and Lilibeth. But it is unclear whether she was planning to meet her estranged father to end their four-year feud. ‘Despite their estrangement, Meghan is concerned,’ an insider told the Mirror. ‘She wants to know if there is any way to contact her dad privately, without other family knowing about it or having to get involved.’ According to a source, she is also concerned she would have to communicate with her half-siblings Thomas Jr, 55, and Samantha, 57, who launched a defamation legal case against her. ‘Meghan can’t contact her half-siblings because she believes they have their own agendas,’ they added. If Mr Markle’s condition had worsened, her presence at the Jubilee party could have been in ­question. The 77-year-old fell ill on Monday and was rushed to a hospital near his home in Rosarito, Mexico, before being transferred to a medical facility in San Diego, California. He can only speak a few words and faces ‘an uphill battle’ to regain his power of speech. After being discharged yesterday, Mr Markle said he feels ‘hugely grateful’ and ‘lucky’ to be alive. ‘I want to thank everyone, especially the wonderful doctors and nurses who saved my life,’ he wrote on a whiteboard. ‘They are angels. ‘I have been deeply moved by loving messages I’ve received from all over the world. People have been so kind.’ He also paid his respects to the Queen and wished her a happy Jubilee and ‘many more years’. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
