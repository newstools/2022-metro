If you were thinking about grabbing a Burger King this week, you’re in luck. The fast food chain has announced the return of Whopper Day – and it’s tomorrow (Wednesday, May 18). For one day and one day only, anyone in the UK can bag themselves a free Whopper burger from any Burger King store, and you don’t even have to buy yourself a drink. The £5.45 Whopper burger is Burger King’s chain’s signature burger and is made up of flame-grilled patty, topped with tomatoes, lettuce, onions and pickle. Veggies and vegans need not fret either, you won’t be left out – the plant based Whopper, which uses a plant patty and vegan mayo, will also be available as part of the offer. All you need to do is download the Burger King app and register an account. Simply run on over to your nearest store, show the cashier and you’ll receive a free burger, no other orders necessary (although who can resist BK’s onion rings?). For food delivery fans, free Whoppers will also be available on any Deliveroo order worth over £15. Katie Evans, chief marketing officer at Burger King said: ‘The Whopper is Burger King’s hero burger – created using fresh ingredients, made to order your way and flame-grilled to create the signature, mouth-watering flavour that our customers love. ‘For one day only we think everyone deserves to get involved with a bite of the action and savour a free Whopper on us. ‘If you haven’t tried a Whopper before, here’s the day to try it.’ Do you have a story to share?
