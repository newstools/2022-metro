Horse racing legend Lester Piggott has died aged 86. The nine-time Epsom Derby winner is widely regarded as one of the greatest jockeys of all time. Piggott, who had a history of heart problems, had been in hospital in Switzerland since last week. Piggot’s son-in-law, Derby-winning trainer William Haggas, said on Sunday: ‘Sadly we can confirm that Lester died peacefully in Switzerland this morning.’ Piggott’s racing career lasted almost 50 years and he rode 4,493 winners, the third-highest tally in British history behind Sir Gordon Richards and Pat Eddery. He was crowned champion jockey 11 times and won 30 English Classic overall. His nine victories in the Derby is a record which still stands today. Piggott won his first Derby in 1954 on 33-1 outsider Never Say Die in 1954 and became the youngest 20th-century jockey to win the race. His ninth and final Derby winner came 29 years later on Teeneso in 1983. In 1975, Piggott was awarded an OBE but he was stripped of that honour after he received a three-year prison sentence in 1987 for income tax evasion. Piggott served 366 days in jail and made a surprise return to the saddle in of 1990, at the age of 54. Ten days into his comeback, Piggott won the Breeders’ Cup Mile on Royal Academy.
