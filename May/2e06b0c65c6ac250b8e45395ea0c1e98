Britain’s biggest ever lottery winners who scooped a ginormous £184m are expected to go public tomorrow. The couple, who won the record-breaking amount in the Euromillions last Tuesday, have kept quiet until now. The pair are said to be from Gloucestershire, though no further details have been released. Their identity will be revealed at a hotel in Cheltenham tomorrow morning, a Camelot spokesperson said. The spokesperson said the winners will share their plans for the future and how it will transform their lives and those of their whole family. The record was previously held by an anonymous ticket-holder who banked £170 million in October 2019. The new record-breakers mark the second EuroMillions jackpot won in the UK this year, with the £109 million jackpot from the draw on February 4 claimed a few days later. When you win a National Lottery prize in the UK, you can decide whether to go public or stay anonymous. It is one of the first choices winners have to make. British lottery winners who have come forward in the past include married couple Frances and Peter Connolly, from Durham. Last month it was revealed they have given away half of their £115m win to charities in just three years. Got a story? Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
