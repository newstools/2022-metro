Whether it’s accompanying chips or slathered on a burger, ketchup is our trusted companion as BBQ season approaches. But it seems the popular condiment might have a new look very soon. That’s because Heinz plans to roll out completely renewable paper bottles, to help the environment. The new bottles will be made with wood pulp and will be available alongside the current glass and plastic options. And the good news is that these paper bottles will not affect the taste of the ketchup. The new containers will be made in partnership with Pulpex – which also created a paper bottle for whisky brand Jonnie Walker – and are part of Heinz’s long-term plan to make all of its packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025. It’s worth pointing out that Heinz already uses 30% recycled plastic and recyclable caps – and the company aim to have zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Kraft Heinz CEO, Miguel Patricio, said: ‘Packaging waste is an industry-wide challenge that we must all do our part to address. ‘That is why we are committed to taking steps to explore sustainable packaging solutions across our brands at Kraft Heinz, offering consumers more choices. ‘This new HEINZ bottle is one example of how we are applying creativity and innovation to explore new ways to provide consumers with the products they know and love while also thinking sustainably.’ Do you have a story to share?
