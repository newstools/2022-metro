Arthur Melo’s agent has revealed that the midfielder was close to joining Arsenal in January and claims the 25-year-old still wants to leave Juventus this summer. The Gunners held extensive talks to sign Arthur in the January transfer window but were unable to reach an agreement with Juventus, who were willing to let the midfielder leave on an 18-month loan with an option to buy for around €40 million (£34m). Arsenal, however, were pushing for a loan deal until the end of the season and it’s understood that the club’s hierarchy were reluctant to agree to Juve’s terms. Arthur has struggled for playing time in recent weeks, starting just two of Juve’s last eight matches in all competitions. And Arthur’s agent, Federico Pastorello, claims the midfielder will now be looking to move clubs this summer. ‘In January he was close to leaving and joining Arsenal,’ Pastorello told La Repubblica. ‘He is too important a player to be marginalised, he must also think about his situation with the national team. ‘He was signed to play a different style of football, with Maurizio Sarri he would have played Jorginho, Allegri likes him but instead he wants to play with two more physical midfielders. ‘It’s a tactical question, and I don’t make the technical choices. ‘But it’s not in anyone’s interest to continue in this situation.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
