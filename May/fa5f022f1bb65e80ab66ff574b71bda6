Erik ten Hag has made it clear that he wants Cristiano Ronaldo to remain at Manchester United for another season. Ronaldo finished the campaign as United’s top scorer in the Premier League with 18 goals but the 37-year-old faced criticism for his overall performances under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick. Reports have claimed that Ronaldo is considering his future at United and would be open to returning to Real Madrid this summer. But Ten Hag is adamant that Ronaldo is part of his plans at Old Trafford. Asked if Ronaldo fits into his project at United, Ten Hag replied: ‘Of course.’ And when asked what Ronaldo can bring next season, Ten Hag said: ‘Goals.’ But Ten Hag was evasive when asked if he wants more leadership from Ronaldo if he remains at Old Trafford for another season. ‘I talk first with Ronaldo then with you,’ said the new United manager. Ten Hag is also confident that he can improve United following their worst-ever Premier League campaign. ‘The confidence is that I have a good feeling with the people around, I have a good feeling from the meetings,’ said the Dutchman. ‘We have a plan and now it’s about to get the plan done, to co-operate, to be consistent in our plan.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
