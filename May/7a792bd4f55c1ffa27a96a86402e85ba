Kevin De Bruyne says he hopes Gabriel Jesus stays at Manchester City following Arsenal’s push to sign the Brazilian forward. The Gunners have already held talks with Jesus’ representatives ahead of the summer transfer window and it’s understood that the 25-year-old is keen on joining Mikel Arteta’s side in the summer window. Jesus has started only 18 games in the Premier League this season plus another two in the Champions League, and the Brazil international is looking to secure more playing time by moving to Arsenal. Jesus has been in sublime form in recent weeks, scoring seven goals in his last six appearances in all competitions. Four of those came in the 5-1 victory over Watford last month, during which De Bruyne allowed Jesus to take a penalty instead of him in order to complete his hat-trick. When asked about that decision, De Bruyne said: ‘I don’t care in that moment, in that moment I thought it was the right decision for him to take so I told Gabi, ‘you can take it, I have full confidence in you’. ‘For him it’s important, for me I don’t care if I score that penalty, that’s a goal or whatever but it doesn’t get me further in what I want to achieve. ‘But for him to get a hat-trick is special and important for a striker, so I thought it was a good moment just to give it to him and he was playing great, I had full confidence he could score. ‘Besides that, he’s been amazing. ‘Since he came here, I’ve had a good relationship with him, I think we’ve found each other lots of times. ‘He plays with so much energy, he’s always there, he helps the team out. ‘I have never any doubts on his quality and he’s still so young. I hope he can play many times with me because I think he makes this team better.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
