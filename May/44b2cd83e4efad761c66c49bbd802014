Kylian Mbappe is reportedly set to snub a move to Real Madrid in order to extend his stay at Paris Saint-Germain. Where Mbappe will be playing his football next season has been the subject of speculation, with the 23-year-old out of contract this summer. The France international looked primed to be joining Carlo Ancelotti’s Real Madrid, but appears to have made a late U-turn. According to Gianluca Di Marzio, Mbappe has decided to sign a new deal to stay at PSG, with an announcement possibly being made tonight by the player. The French club, who were crowned Ligue 1 champions last month, play their final game of the campaign against Metz on Saturday night. Mbappe’s mother and representative, Fayza Al-Amari, revealed earlier this week that the player had reached agreements with both PSG and Madrid. ‘We will not have new meetings to discuss Mbappe’s future, these meetings are now over,’ she told Kora Plus. ‘Now we have found an agreement with both Real Madrid and PSG and the discussions are over because it is Kylian who has to choose now. ‘The two offers are similar, there are no big differences, now we are waiting for Kylian’s choice. ‘The Real Madrid offer in which we have complete control over image rights, and on the other hand, there is a financial compensation that compensates for this. The two offers do not differ greatly between them.’ MORE : Jurgen Klopp speaks out on Liverpool’s interest in Kylian Mbappe For more stories like this, check our sport page.
