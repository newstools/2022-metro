Britney Spears and fiance Sam Asghari have announced they have lost their ‘miracle’ baby as singer Britney suffered a miscarriage. The pair shared the ‘devastating’ news with a statement on Saturday. They said: ‘It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that we have lost our miracle baby early in the pregnancy. ‘This is a devastating time for any parent.’ The couple added: ‘Perhaps we should have waited to announce until we were further along however we were overly excited to share the good news. ‘Our love for each other is our strength. We will continue trying to expand our beautiful family.’ Thanking fans for their support, they went on to ask for privacy ‘during this difficult moment.’ A caption to the devastating post reads: ‘We are grateful for what we have in the process of expanding our beautiful family 💝 Thank you for your support.’ Sam, commenting under the post, added: ‘We will have a miracle soon.’ The devastated couple have been inundated with messages of support from friends and fans, with thousands taking to the comment section to offer love to Sam and Britney. ‘I’m so sorry Britney!’ One fan wrote. ‘I know how much you want another baby. It will happen.’ ‘We love you Britney and Sam,’ another said, urging the couple to ‘stay strong.’ Britney had announced the news of her pregnancy in April, joyously telling fans on Instagram: ‘Well…. I am having a baby.’ The engaged couple first met in 2016, when Britney hired Sam to appear as her love interest in her Slumber Party music video. They started dating soon after and have been inseparable ever since, with the personal trainer sticking by the musician’s side during much her conservatorship ordeal. After being freed from her court order last year, she recently shared how much she wanted to start a family with her beau.
