A senior Conservative MP is accused of spiking four people with date rape drugs – including two fellow MPs. Allegations are said to be swirling in Westminster that the male politician used the substance on another Tory MP who woke up to find his nipples being licked. It’s claimed a Labour MP was also targeted, while the flatmate of another Conservative MP has also come forward to friends as an alleged victim. A fourth man says he rejected the attacker’s advances and later came to suspect his drink was laced, The Mirror reports. A source told the newspaper: ‘The name of this alleged attacker is being spoken about openly among Conservative MPs. ‘If he is innocent, he should refer himself to police and our internal complaints procedure so allegations can be investigated to clear his name.’ Another MP commented saying: ‘No wonder he has been looking so dreadful recently with this hanging over him.’ Rumours that an MP had used a date rape drug first emerged back in 2017, although no formal complaint was made. It comes as a Conservative MP is arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault offences. The man, aged in his 50s, has been bailed but faces further investigation over the alleged crimes committed in London between 2002 and 2009. The MP has been urged to stay away from Parliament but the whip has not been suspended, meaning he remains a member of the parliamentary party. A Government spokesman said: ‘We take all allegations seriously.’ Metro has contacted the government for further comment. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
