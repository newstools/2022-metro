A dad has lost his sight in one eye after a ‘random freak’ accident while on a ‘hike of a lifetime’ in Canada. Edward Steinkamp from Allen, Texas, went to walk across a log to avoid wading through mud while hiking the West Coast trail with his son Bret, 28. But the experienced hiker slipped and fell onto a stick, which rammed through his left eye and into his brain. Rescuers were called but it took them six hours – and a refueling by the National Guard – before they could reach him. Edward was flown by helicopter to hospital where the branch was removed – but is now fighting off a painful infection in Victoria General Hospital. To make the family’s nightmare even worse, they are now facing huge medical bills. Aeronautical engineer Edward had insurance but it is uncertain what exactly will be covered and a fundraising page has been set up to raise $200,000 (£161,000). It’s yet to be confirmed, but he could have to pay for the airlift rescue, the surgery, drugs and scans and the hospital stay. Wife Wendy flew over immediately to be by her husband’s bedside and has had to shell out for a hotel with Brett. The pair will also have to drive Edward across the country to get home as he isn’t allowed to fly for months. Speaking with Times Colonist about his dad’s condition, Bret said: ‘Everything is really fluid right now.’ ‘This fundraiser is so that Ed can concentrate on getting well and not worry about how he will take care of his family or pay for these bills’, the fundraising page says. ‘Ed has touched so many of our lives with kindness and laughter. He has never turned down any one of us whenever we have asked for help or in our time of need.’ Wendy and Bret are asking people to send in backpacking photographs to help raise Edward’s spirits while he recovers in hospital.
