Jamie O’Neill has been suspended from playing on the World Snooker Tour until August after he turned up for a match drunk, made inappropriate comments and gestures to female members of staff and then played his game under the influence of alcohol. The world number 112 will miss the Championship League and the European Masters at the start of the upcoming season after being hit with the ban and a fine of £1,500, plus £3,200 in costs. O’Neill had already received a two-event suspension last year for inappropriate behaviour towards hotel and WST staff and breaching hotel rules. The 35-year-old also received suspended fines over the 2020-21 season for inappropriate comments and live streams posted on social media. All this was taken into account when the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) chose to suspend him again, and he will not be eligible to play again until the British Open qualifiers in August. O’Neill, who also works as a tiler, reached a high point on the world rankings of number 79 last year, thanks in part to his best run in a ranking event to the last 16 of the Scottish Open. He played 12 matches last season, winning just three, although one of those wins came in the match in question in the Northern Ireland Open, in which he beat Michael Judge 4-2.
