A group of students have been disciplined after ‘blacks only’ and ‘whites only’ signs were put onto water fountains at a school. Pictures of the signs at Colerain High School in Cincinnati, Ohio, spread on social media. The school says that the signs – which had frowning emojis – were on the wall for around 30 seconds before being removed by the students who put them up. Some have said the ‘tasteless and hurtful act’ is reminiscent of Jim Crow laws which legalized segregation in the US. The school said the students responsible were punished severely soon after the racist messages appeared on May 5. A spokesman said: ‘We want to make sure our staff, students, families and community understands where we stand on racial intolerance, discrimination, racism and hatred. We take this matter very seriously. ‘This type of behavior is not and will not be condoned or tolerated. The actions that were displayed do NOT reflect the values and the culture we’ve worked so hard to cultivate in all of our schools across the district,’ the statement read. About 30% of Colerain High School’s 1,730 students are black and 49% is white, according to US News and World Report. Officials added: ‘The students involved in the incident posted the signs, took photos and removed the notes before posting the photos online.’ A mother who said the incident pushed the school back generations said: ‘My heart dropped. My heart dropped. I could not believe it. It was so offensive.’ Another mom called it a ‘hate crime,’ before adding that the incident is ‘racism swept under the rug.’ They both said the school needed to address racism head-on, but didn’t want their children to face retaliation for speaking out. The school district said they ‘remain committed to teaching love, inclusivity and compassion.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
