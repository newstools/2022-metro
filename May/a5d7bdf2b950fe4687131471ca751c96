Boris and Carrie Johnson have christened their second child at Westminster Cathedral. Five-month-old Romy, short for Rosemary, was baptised in a private ceremony at the UK’s largest Catholic church, where her parents got married last year. The service came on the weekend of her parents’ first wedding anniversary. It also followed in the footsteps of her brother Wilfred, now two, who was baptised at the cathedral in September 2020. Mr Johnson and his wife, who have both been embroiled in the partygate scandal, were joined by the wider Johnson clan for the ceremony. The PM is fiercely secretive over his private life, not allowing his son’s face to be photographed and generally refusing to be drawn on family matters. He only recently confirmed publicly how many children he has fathered after years of uncertainty over the matter. The couple announced Romy’s birth at a London hospital on December 9. Carrie said in an Instagram post that Wilf had been ‘stroking Romy’s hair, giving big kisses and playing with his matchbox cars right next to her crib, just in case she feels like joining in too.’ She thanked the maternity staff at University College London Hospital for looking them, adding: ‘we are so so grateful.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
