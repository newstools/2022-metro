Benfica striker Darwin Nunez has rejected an approach from Manchester United, according to reports in France. The Uruguay international has been in sublime form for Benfica this season, scoring 32 goals in all competitions, including six in the Champions League. The 22-year-old has attracted interest from several clubs across Europe ahead of the summer transfer window, with Paris Saint-Germain, Arsenal, United and Newcastle United all keen on a deal. According to RMC Sport, United have already indicated to Nunez’s camp that they would be willing to pay €80 million (£67.8m) to sign the striker this summer. But the report claims that Nunez has refused United’s approach as he wants to join a club who will be in the Champions League next season. Newcastle United have also reportedly made an approach for Nunez but have rejected by the Uruguayan for the same reason. Nunez’s decision to snub United will also serve as a blow for Arsenal, as they also face the prospect of missing out on a place in next season’s Champions League. The Gunners are in the market for a new striker and Nunez has been on their shortlist alongside Manchester City’s Gabriel Jesus. PSG, meanwhile, could step up their efforts to sign Nunez as they look set to lose Kylian Mbappe on a free transfer to Real Madrid. It’s understood that Mbappe has now agreed personal terms with Madrid and only a late change of heart would see him remain in the French capital. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
