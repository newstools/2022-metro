A man allegedly burglarized a home and then mowed the back and front yards of the victim’s home before fleeing. Marcus Renard Hubbard is accused of burglarizing a home in southeast Texas and using the owner’s push lawnmower on April 1. Surveillance footage released by the Port Arthur Police Department on Thursday shows the suspect taking the lawnmower out and filling the tank with gas. The suspect is seen mowing a patch of grass in the backyard. Another video clip shows him mowing the front lawn along a white picket fence. At one point, the suspect stops to take one of the sticks of the fence that had previously fallen off, and place it on the other side so he can continue with the yard work. Police received a complaint of an unknown person cutting grass on their property. Once cops arrived, the man pulled the lawnmower behind him and ran into a nearby alley. Hubbard is wanted for burglarizing a building. It was not known what, if anything, the suspect stole. Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers.
