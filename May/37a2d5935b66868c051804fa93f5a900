Chelsea bidder Todd Boehly is aiming to keep both Bruce Buck and Marina Granovskaia at Stamford Bridge. Boehly’s consortium has been selected as the preferred candidate to take over Chelsea from Roman Abramovich, who put the club up for sale before he was sanctioned by the UK government. Both Granovskaia and Buck have been key figures during Abramovich’s reign at Stamford Bridge, and it’s understood that Boehly wants to keep the pair in place when the purchase goes through. However, Julian Knight, chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, has warned that those connected with Abramovich should no longer be part of Chelsea following the takeover. ‘Any continuity with the Abramovich regime at Chelsea is certainly an unsettling development,’ Knight told the Financial Times. ‘There needs to be clarity surrounding the process to ensure that everything is being done to the letter.’ Meanwhile, the takeover process hit a snag this week after reports claimed that Abramovich has U-turned over his decision to write off Chelsea’s £1.6 billion debt. Abramovich had initially stated that he would not ask for any loans to be repaid but The Times report that the UK government has been told that the debt would need to be repaid to Jersey-based company Camberley International Investments, which appears to have links to Abramovich. However, the government has insisted throughout the process that Abramovich should not financially benefit from Chelsea’s sale. Sources close to Abramovich claim that the sanctions that have been imposed on him mean he is no longer able to write off the debt. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
