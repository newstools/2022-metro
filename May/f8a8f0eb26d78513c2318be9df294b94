Get your wardrobe ready for some florals, because the ‘Queen of Print’ back with a new high street collection. This femme, floral collection is the result of a partnership between Lipsy London and Greek-born luxury fashion designer Mary Katrantzou. Consisting of 30 pieces in total, the collection will be launching today, May 31. It includes one-of-a-kind prints on tea dresses, maxis, and swim/beachwear. Mary said: ‘We are delighted to be working with Lipsy on this capsule range that draws inspiration from our prints. ‘The flora and fauna motif prints that emblazon summer dresses and beachwear alongside famed ombre valley prints are designed to be building blocks of a woman’s vacation wardrobe.’ Wedding season is in full swing, and we can see these pieces gracing receptions across the country.
