EastEnders star Danniella Westbrook has been seen on the red carpet for the first time following her nose job. The actress, known for her role as Sam Mitchell in the BBC One soap, recently underwent reconstructive surgery. Her decision comes after years of drug abuse, revealing she needs the surgery due to the addiction and osteoporosis. Last night (May 5), Danniella was seen attending a Celeb MMA party at Lit London. Pictured for the first time after her nose operation, Danniella was wearing a pink jumpsuit and wedged shoes. Speaking to The Sun about her surgery, Danniella said: ‘I’ve spent the last seven years trying to get somebody to do it, but they said no in case it failed and they got struck off. Plastic surgeons wanted £500,000 to change my face, so I thought I was never going to get it done. It was only because I went into intensive care before Christmas. ‘I couldn’t breathe because I had a cold. There was a build up of fluid and after I fell asleep I couldn’t wake up properly and ended up in ICU. I was sent over to Aintree Hospital in Liverpool and it’s only because I was put in front of the right doctors, or else I’d still be waiting now to find someone.’ Back in March, the actress was very open about other reasons when it comes to why she is having multiple surgeries to change the way she looks. ‘People message me, saying, “you’re so ugly, you’re a junkie, you should just go and kill yourself”. I’ve also had messages saying they are glad I’m not coming back to EastEnders because no one wants me scaring their kids on the telly’, she told The Sun publication. ‘Sometimes I wake up and think “I don’t want to die today but I don’t want to face the world either”.’ Following the return of Sam Mitchell (now played by Kim Medcalf) in EastEnders, Danniella told OK! Magazine that because of the ops, she wouldn’t have the time to reprise her role as Sam. MORE : EastEnders spoilers: 54 pictures reveal major fight, shock robbery and reunion
