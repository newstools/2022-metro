A thief who wore his hoodie up in court said he needed to cover his head as his hair was a mess – despite admitting to stealing £50 of shampoo. Liam O’Reilly, 42, insisted he couldn’t remove his hood in the dock as his hair was in a complete state. But his remark sparked amusement among JPs at Blackburn Magistrates Court in Lancashire. One of the chairs of the bench bit back by replying: ‘I’m not sure why your hair is a mess, it should be lovely with all that John Frieda.’ The shampoo thief had nabbed the John Frieda products from a Boots store in Darwen, Lancashire. He was ordered to pay £50 compensation for the incident on March 14th. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
