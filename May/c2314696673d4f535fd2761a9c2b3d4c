Terrifying footage shows the moment two boys were seconds away from being hit by a train – but managed to hastily jump out of the way. Another child clung to the side of a fence on the edge of a bridge after the group trespassed on train tracks in Toronto. The three children were thankfully not seriously injured in the dangerous incident. But transport bosses have released the footage as a warning to any potential copycats. A crew member on the Milton Line GO spotted the boy on the bridge while approaching the Humber River overpass in Etobicoke, near Dundas Street West. The train ‘narrowly’ missed him before staff clocked the other two schoolboys who were running on the track ‘as if they were trying to outrun the train’. Tragedy was scarcely avoided as the horn was blasted and the emergency brakes slammed on. Metrolinx, the government agency that manages road and public transport in Ontario, said: ‘Knowing just how dangerous their actions were, the crew had to act fast if there was any way to prevent hitting them. ‘Incidents like this are too often tragic and life-altering – not only for loved ones but for the crew and first responders involved.’ The children ran off as the crew began the recovery to get the train moving again. Bosses at Metrolinx have issued an appeal to their parents to get in touch. Steve Weir, Metrolinx manager of customer protective services, said: ‘We aren’t looking to be punitive, but we are very eager to speak with your children to help educate them and ensure they never ever take this kind of risk again.’ Other parents have been asked to use the opportunity to speak to their kids about the dangers of walking or playing on and around train tracks.
