Ever fancied having your own outdoor cinema? Well, if you’ve got £2.1million lying around then the dream can become a reality, with this stunning Grecian villa that’s up for sale. Oh, and just to top it off, the villa sits on the coast of the Aegean sea – giving you some jaw-droppingly gorgeous views of crystal blue waters. The sprawling property can be found on one of the Cyclades archipelagos (AKA islands) off the mainland of Greece. With the sea just moments away, this five-bedroom property, in Mykonos, is the extravagant holiday home of dreams. When you’re not enjoying the calming oasis of waves lapping near your front door, you can win ‘host of the year’ by screening a film in your open-air cinema. After the screening, you can chill in the hot tub or pool, before cooking up a treat with the BBQ. Inside, there’s even more space for entertaining in the communal areas with an open-plan kitchen, a living room – that has a built-in fireplace – and a dining room with enough seats for 10 people. There are six bathrooms throughout the property and many of them are en suites to the bedrooms. The master bedroom can be found on the top of all three floors, where you’ll also get your own private balcony. You can easily pop into the town of Mykonos Old Port, and jet away from the nearby airport. If you fancy dreaming about your Grecian escape, the property is on the market with Valerie Panagou of JK Property & Yachting, Luxury Portfolio International. Do you have a story to share?
