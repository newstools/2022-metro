Royal Mail has announced plans to increase its use of drones for deliveries with the creation of 50 new ‘postal drone routes’. The British postal service said it was aiming to use up to 200 drones over the next three years, servicing all corners of the UK. The first routes for the new service include the Isles of Scilly, Shetland Islands, Orkney Islands and the Hebrides. ‘On-time delivery regardless of our customers’ location or the weather, whilst protecting our environment, is our goal,’ said Simon Thompson, chief executive of Royal Mail. ‘Even though we go everywhere, Royal Mail already has the lowest CO2 emissions per parcel delivered. This initiative will help reduce our emissions even further,’ he added. The postal service has conducted four drone trials over the past 18 months, including flights on the Isle of Mull in Scotland, the Isles of Scilly off the Cornish coast and between Kirkwall and North Ronaldsay on the Orkney Islands. The new drone service has also been tested between between Tingwall Airport in Lerwick and Unst, a 50-mile flight each way, carrying 100kg of mail. The use of drones is expected to reduce Royal Mail’s carbon emissions and provide faster and more convenient services for remote communities. Royal Mail currently uses ferries, conventional aircraft and land-based delivery which can be affected by bad weather. The service is a collaboration with logistics drone company Windracers, and is subject to Civil Aviation Authority approval. MORE : Do Royal Mail, Amazon, and Evri deliver on Sundays?
