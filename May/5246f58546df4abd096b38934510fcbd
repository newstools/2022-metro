Paul Pogba reached an agreement to join Manchester City before U-turning due to concerns over the reaction he would receive from Manchester United fans, according to reports. The World Cup winner is set to leave Old Trafford as a free agent this summer as his contract is due to expire. Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid have all held talks over a deal for the 29-year-old. But Pogba also had the chance to remain in the Premier League as City were also keen on a move. The Times report that City had even agreed personal terms with Pogba but the midfielder opted against joining Pep Guardiola’s side as he felt his life would be made ‘unbearable’ by United supporters if he remained in Manchester. The report claims that Pogba has informed City that his next move will be to a club outside of the Premier League. Earlier this week, Pogba’s representatives met with Juventus to discuss the prospect of re-joining the Serie A club this summer. The France international won four Serie A titles during his first stint at Juve before he returned to United in an £89 million deal in 2016. United will play their final game of the season on Sunday as they travel to Crystal Palace but Pogba will be unavailable due to a calf injury. Pogba’s last appearance for United was in their 4-0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield last month. For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
