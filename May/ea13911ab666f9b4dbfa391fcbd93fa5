Prince William is appearing on his first official coin to mark his 40th birthday next month. The commemorative £5 coin shows the future king alone on one side and the 96-year-old Queen on the other. Created by Thomas Docherty, it depicts William with his royal cypher — the initial W — and the number 40. An inscription on the edge reads: ‘HRH The Duke of Cambridge.’ Mr Docherty said he tried to strike a balance between ‘the fresh energy of His Royal Highness being a young dad with the ceremonial nature of his position’. The new Royal Mint collection will include a limited edition two-coin set, featuring a 0.25oz gold celebration coin and a 1982 sovereign coin – the year the duke was born. There will also be a special 5oz gold coin, designed with laser technology to give William a 3D appearance. Clare Maclennan, from the Royal Mint, said: ‘The elegant design features a portrait of HRH alongside his royal cypher and the number 40, which pays homage to the maturity and grace of the prince who has become a senior member of the royal family, a devoted husband and a loving father of three, through the eyes of the world. ‘Marking this extra special occasion, we have also struck a limited edition gold coin made with 5oz of fine gold and struck in high relief to elevate the artistry of the design. ‘Our limited edition precious metal coins combine fine craftsmanship and rarity, making them an attractive keepsake for collectors and investors.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
