A British tourist is being tested for monkeypox after arriving in the Canary Islands. Spanish health chiefs in Fuerteventura confirmed the man is one of five suspected new cases. His name and age are currently unknown, but he is thought to be the first British tourist to be tested for the virus abroad. ‘A suspected case of monkeypox in Fuerteventura corresponds to a British tourist,’ the Canary Islands’ Health Service said. Officials have not yet confirmed if has the virus, or whether he was holidaying alone on the island. It comes as the number of monkeypox cases in England more than doubled yesterday to 56. UK health bosses say the outbreak is ‘significant and concerning’ but stressed the risk to the wider population remains low. Spain has so far confirmed around 40 cases of monkeypox and said another 67 people are being tested. The outbreaks have been traced to an adult sauna in Madrid and a Gran Canaria pride festival attended by 80,000 people from Britain and other European countries. Chief medical advisor Dr Susan Hopkins warned British tourists to be ‘alert to the virus’ on holiday. ‘The risk to the general population remains extremely low,’ Dr Hopkins told the BBC. ‘People need to be alert to it, and we really want clinicians to be alert to it.’ The disease is usually found in parts of central and west Africa and is rarely seen outside the region. But cases have now been recorded in the UK, US, Canada, Spain and Italy in recent weeks. People who have developed a rash and are changing sexual partners frequently are also urged to come forward and seek diagnosis.
