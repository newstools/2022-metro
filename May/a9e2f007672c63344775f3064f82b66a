A ‘perverse’ woman who had sex with a 15-year-old boy twice while her boyfriend was at work has been jailed. Laura Stephenson, 28, exchanged ‘flirty’ messages with the schoolboy and lured him to her home in 2018. Her victim, who has not been named for legal reasons, suffered mental health issues and disclosed the abuse to his GP before a referral was made to social care. In her police interview, Stephenson admitted having sex with the boy but claimed it was consensual. She also attempted to blame her victim, while saying she felt guilty about her conduct. Stephenson was jailed for 21 months at Sheffield Crown Court after admitting two counts of sexual activity with a child. Investigating officer Natalie Duffy said Stephenson was aware her actions were ‘wrong’ but pursued the teen regardless. She said: ‘Stephenson claimed she knew her actions were wrong due to the boy’s age, but this wasn’t enough to stop her, and instead she presented a number of excuses for her perverse actions.’ Ms Duffy also praised the boy for coming forward and assisting the police with their investigation. She added: ‘I would like to praise the victim for the tremendous courage he has shown throughout the investigation and court proceedings. ‘Abuse like this can have life-long, damaging impacts for victims and we will do all we can, alongside social care, to support those at risk and seek justice on their behalf.’ Stephenson was also handed a 10-year sexual harm prevention order and made to pay victim costs of £140.
