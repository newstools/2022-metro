 A friend of the politician dubbed ‘porn MP’ said he can ‘see’ how he managed to click onto the X-rated site. Neil Parish, 65, resigned yesterday after he admitted watching porn in the House of Commons. The former Tory MP for Tiverton and Honiton in Devon said he visited the website by accident while looking at tractors online, but then returned to the site deliberately in a ‘moment of madness’. People are racking their brains to understand how Mr Parish could have gone from tractors to porn, but it appears he has told at least one of friends. Devon County councillor Chris Slade was asked in an interview with the BBC if he believed Mr Parish was actually searching for farm vehicles. He said: ‘Yes, I know what he was actually looking for – the tractor he was looking for. ‘And I can see how that can go to something totally different,’ he added with a laugh. In an interview with The Times, Mr Parish’s wife said it was ‘very embarrassing’, adding pornography is ‘demeaning’ to women. She told the newspaper: ‘He’s quite a normal guy, really. He’s a lovely person. It’s just so stupid. ‘People shouldn’t be looking at pornography. He would never just sit there with people looking.’ According to Labour’s Jess Phillips, Mr Parish could be jailed for two years after appearing to commit a criminal offence under the Indecent Displays Act. ‘There are plenty of laws on the statute books that are meant to protect women and girls in society, however they are not enacted,’ the shadow minister told the Observer. ‘They are very rarely enacted appropriately.’ Mr Parish’s ‘moment of madness’ appears to have started another scandal in Westminster. Other MPs, including Labour’s Chris Bryant, have spoken about being sexually assaulted, while Parliamentary staff have reportedly drawn up a list of ‘sex pest’ politicians in a bid to warn others.
