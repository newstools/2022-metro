A man has died in a dog attack at a home in Wales, with the animal euthanised and others removed. The 62-year-old, said to be dog sitting for his son, went into cardiac arrest after being bitten. Paramedics rushed to a property on Holt Road, Wrexham, shortly before midday on Monday, but could not save him. One local claims to have regularly seen two or three ‘vicious’ bulldog type dogs fighting with each other in the garden of the house. ‘They are vicious, you don’t want to go near them’, she said. ‘They are not the type of dog you want to mess with. You would think twice before petting them.’ Another nearby resident revealed he woke up around 11.30am yesterday to a man screaming and muffled growls. ‘It was not a blood-curdling scream. It seemed like the dog had him and he was trying to get it off’, he told The Mirror. One man has suggested the owners were breeding and selling American Bully dogs. The victim had let out the group of dogs as his son travelled home from a football match at Wembley, reports suggest. His loved ones have asked for privacy in the wake of the tragedy. The dog was ‘securely contained at the property and was euthanised by a vet at the scene’. Other dogs being kept at the house have been removed by trained dog handlers and will be temporarily kennelled. North Wales Police has launched an investigation into the incident. A spokesperson for the Welsh Ambulance Service said: ‘We were called on Monday, May 23 at 11:33hrs to reports of a medical emergency in the Holt Road area of Wrexham. ‘We sent three emergency ambulances, two rapid response vehicles and the Wales Air Ambulance to the scene.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
