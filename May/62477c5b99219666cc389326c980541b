Ivan Perisic has promised Tottenham Hotspur fans ‘a lot of hard work’ after his arrival on a free transfer from Inter Milan. The versatile 33-year-old brings a wealth of experience with him to north London, having played for the likes of Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Wolfsburg and Inter before coming to the Premier League, while also racking up 113 caps for Croatia. Once a forward who is expected to operate at wing-back under Antonio Conte at Spurs, Perisic is known for his work rate and ability to fill in wherever he is needed, which he intends to bring to his new club. ‘I’m going to bring, first of all, a lot of hard work. I like to work a lot, I like to work for the team because only like this you can win something important,’ said Perisic. ‘I can play several positions in the system Tottenham is playing now. I will bring a lot of experience as well, I’ve played for a lot of great clubs and, like I said, I can’t wait to start to play, to train and give my best.’ Conte and Perisic worked together at Inter and enjoyed great success as they claimed the Serie A title in 2021 and the Croatian is excited to link up with the Italian once again. ‘It’s a privilege to work again with a coach like this,’ he said. ‘We did well at Inter, won the league after 10 or 11 years, it was a perfect year. I’m really happy to see him again. I think we’re going to do some good things here in England. ‘He’s living football, every minute, every hour, every day, even when he’s sleeping, he’s thinking about football! ‘He’s so passionate. He wants to win. I like his character and I know we’re going to do a great job here.’ MORE : Paul Pogba drops trailer for documentary ‘The Pogmentary’ as Manchester United exit looms MORE : Richarlison non-committal on Everton future amid Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham links For more stories like this, check our sport page.
