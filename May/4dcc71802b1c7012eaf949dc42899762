A British 80-year-old has reportedly been shot dead in the south of Spain. The expat was killed in her own Alicante home, according to Spanish police. Investigators are treating the death as murder but no arrests have been made. The woman’s body was discovered just after 6.30pm yesterday after police were called to a property near Elche. According to local reports, the unnamed woman was ‘shot at least three times’ in her home on a residential estate. Worried neighbours are said to have called the police after she did not answer when a plumber arrived for an arranged visit. A police source told reporters that it is possible she was shot by intruders intending to burgle her property. A post-mortem investigation is expected to take place shortly. A spokesperson for Spain’s National Police said: ‘We are investigating the death of a British woman who was shot dead at a property in Elche. ‘We are investigating it as a murder and can confirm she was shot dead. ‘The alarm was raised around 6.30pm yesterday/on Wednesday. ‘She was 80 years old and lived alone. ‘No arrests have yet been made and the investigation is ongoing. We are not in a position to discuss the possible motive at this stage.’ Metro has contacted the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office for comment.
