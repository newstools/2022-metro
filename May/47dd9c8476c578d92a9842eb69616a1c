Andreas Christensen pulled out of Chelsea’s squad on the day of their FA Cup final against Liverpool, according to reports. The Denmark international played a full 90 minutes in Chelsea’s 3-0 victory over Leeds United last Wednesday and was in contention to play a part in the final at Wembley. But Christensen informed Thomas Tuchel on Saturday morning that he would be unavailable for his team’s fixture against Liverpool, despite not carrying an injury. The Telegraph report that sources close to Christensen claimed he had felt unwell in the week leading up to the game and did not expect to start against Jurgen Klopp’s side. Meanwhile, The Guardian reports that Chelsea’s players were ‘shocked and confused’ by Christensen’s decision to withdraw from the squad so close to the match. Last month, Christensen asked to be substituted at half time in the 4-2 defeat to Arsenal due to injury, while the 26-year-old pulled out out of the squad against West Ham after suffering from stomach cramps. Christensen was also replaced at half time during Chelsea’s 3-1 defeat at home to Real Madrid in April following a poor performance up against Vinicius Junior. The Dane now has two games remaining with Chelsea before he is expected to complete his free transfer to Barcelona. Tuchel, meanwhile, admitted after the FA Cup final defeat that Chelsea may find it difficult to close the gap on Liverpool and Manchester City this summer. ‘It’s maybe impossible, I have to say,’ said the Chelsea manager. ‘They are improving their squad in every transfer window. It seems like we are losing key players. ‘We are losing Toni, we’re losing Andreas. This is tough and we already have a gap to close.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
