Carol Vorderman was more than happy to rush to the rescue of a fellow mountain hiker who found himself stranded over the weekend. The Countdown presenter enjoyed the great outdoors at Brecon Beacons, a stunning mountain range in Wales, on Saturday. However, she came across a man and his friend who accidentally locked the keys inside the car after stepping out for a hike. Tyrone Coburn revealed his plight in a Facebook post, explaining: ‘Locked my keys in my car today after walking the horse shoe in Brecon. ‘Had no signal to phone AA and this kind lady CAROL VORDERMAN came to my rescue and gave me a lift to the nearest village so I could ring them, what a lovely lady she is.’ The hiker included a selfie of himself and Carol, who is seen smiling and giving a thumbs up in her car after racing to his aid. Sharing her account of her heroic efforts, the TV presenter told her Instagram followers: ‘Awwwww. I was wandering around the Beacons yesterday and chatting to an ex teacher who was manning one of the car parks for @breconbeacons. ‘Then Tyrone and his two friends came over and said that he’d locked his keys in his car. Problem was he would have to climb back up a mountain for a signal to ring the AA or walk 5 Miles to the nearest village…. ‘Er Hello….time for a lift.’ It seems the pair got on like a house on fire as Carol, 61, recalled fondly: ‘He made me laugh tho cos we were chatting away in the car and it was only when I took my sunnies off that he recognised me.’ She then quipped: ‘Two frights at once. Seeing it was the old numbers bird off the telly and it was her without make up as well!!!! ‘Glad you got back home safe and sound tho T. Always glad to help, just as you would help some other soul too I’m sure 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 ‘Happy days.’ One of Tyrone’s friends who was also stranded and rescued by Carol, wrote: ‘Wed still be there now if you didnt help cant thank you enough,’ to which the star replied: ‘Glad you made it in the end 👍🏼👍🏼’ Carol’s followers praised her kindness, with Steps singer Ian ‘H’ Watkins commenting: ‘Not all hero’s wear capes!’ Another follower said: ‘The Good karma bus.’ ‘Fantastic gesture CV You make Wales proud,’ another cheered.
