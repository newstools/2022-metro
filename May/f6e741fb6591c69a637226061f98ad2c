Doctor Who fans have quite the few weeks, with news about the autumn special, regeneration, and 60th anniversary being absolutely through the roof. Truly, we need a lie down at this point. Not only is former showrunner Russell T Davies returning, he’ll be helming the show with Sex Education’s Ncuti Gatwa as the next Time Lord when Jodie Whittaker steps down this autumn. Meanwhile, for the 60th anniversary, the iconic duo of David Tennant and Catherine Tate will be making their returns after playing the 10th Doctor and Donna Noble. As if that wasn’t enough, Heartstopper’s Yasmin Finney is joining the cast as a character named Rose. So, here’s everything we know so far. Doctor Who returns to BBC One this autumn. Got a story?
