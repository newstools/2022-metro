Erik ten Hag will not travel with Ajax’s squad for their post-season trip to Curacao and will begin work with Manchester United on Monday. Ten Hag took charge of his final game with Ajax on Sunday as they drew 2-2 with Vitesse. Ajax’s squad are now due to travel to Curacao for a friendly against the national side as well as to fulfil sponsorship commitments. But Ten Hag has opted to travel to Manchester instead in order to begin his preparations with United ahead of next season. ‘Tomorrow there will be a party with the staff but I’m not going to Curacao this week,’ Ten Hag said on Sunday. ‘There is a lot of work that still needs to be done. I think that’s understandable. This applies to every [new] club. ‘A number of things still need to be organised with the staff and also with the squad. We will be working intensively on that from tomorrow.’ Ten Hag, who guided Ajax to the Eredivisie title in his final season with the Dutch club, also sent a clear message to United’s squad on Sunday. When asked in his post-match interview if he was ready for the ‘sharks’ in the media once he moves to United, Ten Hag replied: ‘I don’t see them like that. I don’t see you like that too, nobody. ‘What it’s all about is the dressing room, you need to be able to manage the dressing room. You have to make it function. That’s how you win games.’ Ten Hag has already held several meetings with United’s hierarchy, the most recent of which took place in Amsterdam this week. Steve McClaren, who was Sir Alex Ferguson’s assistant during United’s treble-winning campaign in 1999, is now set to be part of Ten Hag’s new-look coaching set-up. United, meanwhile, are preparing for their final Premier League game of the season next Sunday as Ralf Rangnick’s side travel to Crystal Palace. For more stories like this, check our sport page.
