The Bafta TV Awards 2022 are here, and while we’re excited about the actual awards (and the news that Ncuti Gatwa will be the new Doctor), we’re also here for the fashion. Ahead, we’ll be sharing all the celebrity red carpet looks you need to see from today’s event. You can expect plenty of sparkly gowns, glitz, and glamour – so we won’t be bothering with any boring black suits. The list will be updated as stars arrive, with the latest at the top. Let’s go!
