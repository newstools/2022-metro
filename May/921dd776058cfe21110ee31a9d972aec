A driver crashed into the front garden of Boris Johnson’s £1.3 million house in south London in the early hours of this morning. Debris was left strewn across the driveway after the black Vauxhall Astra ploughed into a bush. Neighbours in Camberwell said the collision at around 1am sounded like ‘thunder’. The car, which was finally towed away at around 5pm, damaged hedges and a tree, and knocked down a small pillar in front of the house. The driver suffered minor injuries, and appeared to be retrieving his possessions from the side door of the vehicle before it was towed away. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: ‘Officers attended and found a car that had struck the exterior of a property causing minor damage. ‘The driver of the car sustained a minor injury and was assessed by paramedics, but did not require hospital treatment. No offences were identified.’ The prime minister bought the four-bedroom property with wife Carrie Johnson for £1.2 million in July 2019, according to Land Registry documents. The Times reported the house was paid for using a buy-to-let mortgage and was undergoing renovation. The register of MPs’ interests states that the PM, who currently resides in Downing Street, has a rental income of at least £10,000 a year.
