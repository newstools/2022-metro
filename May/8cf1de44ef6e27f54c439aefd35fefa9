A family left all their rubbish behind after eating at a KFC to the shock of other customers. A photo showed a table filled with trash at a food court in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. More rubbish and a puddle of spilt soft drinks could also be seen on the surrounding floor. Reddit user Xshpeare shared the image on the “Trashy” forum on Monday and claimed eight to 10 people left the filth. He told Newsweek: ‘I was shocked when I saw how dirty they left it, it was so dirty that three workers had to clean it instead of the usual one. ‘I even took a picture because I’ve never seen a mess that bad in a food court.’ Usually, the family could be fined 500 Saudi Riyals (£105) for littering and then double if they did it again, but they may escape a penalty because it was a food court. In January, residents in an upmarket part of London opposed an application to extend the opening times of a local KFC due to concern over ‘anti-social behaviour’. A KFC franchise partner had hoped to increase the opening times of the takeaway in Richmond Green from 11pm to 2am on Fridays and Saturdays. But locals feared it could lead to ‘noise’ and ‘littering’ and made their concern known during a licencing hearing, MyLondon reported. Peter Willan, a Friends of Richmond Green (FORG) group member, told the Richmond Council hearing he thought the extension to opening hours would cause a ‘disturbance’ as it would be the only takeaway open late. Solicitor Matthew Phipps, who represents KFC franchise partners The Iceking Group, said his clients were committed to improving the litter problem in the area. Richmond Council was expected to decide on an extension of opening hours In January. As of now, the opening hours are still from 11am to 11pm on weekends.
