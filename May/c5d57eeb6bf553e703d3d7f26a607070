People have been warned that certain bottles of Irn-Bru could end up giving them a fright or worse when their caps ‘pop off unexpectedly’. The bottles affected are made of glass and 750ml, with either the regular or the 1901 drink inside. Issuing a recall, the company said: ‘We believe this to be an infrequent, intermittent fault in some of our bottles. ‘The liquid in the bottle is good and tastes as you would expect.’ If customers dare to drink them, they  they should ‘open the bottles with care torelease the pressure’. Manufacturer A.G. Barr said the bottles should be handled carefully, pointed away from the body at arm’s length. The affected products can be identified by the codes stamped on to the neck of the bottle. Manufacturers said: ‘At A.G. Barr p.l.c we take great care to ensure that our products reach our consumers and customers in perfect condition and are sorry that on this occasion a limited quantity of our products has failed to meet expectations.’ But some people on Twitter saw the potential for the unrestrained caps to improve the drink. One responded: ‘Leave it. People can celebrate with The Bru instead of champagne.’ Another said: ‘Even the cap can’t contain a drink made from girders’. But one man asked: ‘I’m curious – has anyone ever left enough time between buying their ginger and drinking it for a product recall to have any relevance to them?’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
