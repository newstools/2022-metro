An ‘evil’ dad who murdered his two-year-old son to spite his ex-partner has been jailed for life. Lukasz Czapla’s fury towards former partner Patrycja Szczesniak drove him to kill their son Julius at his home address in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, in November 2020. The toddler was shot in the head with a BB gun, stabbed with a skewer-like instrument and smothered with a pillow. Czapla, 41, was found guilty of murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 23 years. The judge, Lord Beckett, told him: ‘You have been found guilty of murdering your two-year-old son. ‘For murder you will be sentenced to life in prison.’ He concluded Czapla ‘acted out of spite to kill the child to get back at his mother’. In a statement released though police, Ms Szczesniak said: ‘I only wanted the best for you. If only I could only turn back time to have you in my arms again my child. ‘Despite the breakup with Juliusz’s dad, I wanted him to have contact with our son. I never stopped him seeing Juliusz. ‘Julek loved him like every child loves their dad. He trusted him, he trusted him completely. ‘Juliusz was murdered only for revenge. His dad wanted me to suffer, he succeeded and achieved his goal, at the cost of my beloved little boy’s life. ‘If only I knew what was going to happen. I would have never thought he could do this to my child.’ This is a breaking news story, more to follow soon… Check back shortly for further updates. Got a story?
