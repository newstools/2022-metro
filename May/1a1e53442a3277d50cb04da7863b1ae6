Everton are assisting the Merseyside Police after Brentford players Ivan Toney and Rico Henry said their families were racially abused at Goodison Park on Sunday. Henry scored Brentford’s winning goal in their 3-2 victory against Frank Lampard’s side, while Toney also involved in the incident which saw Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite sent off after just 18 minutes. Brentford’s preparations were also disrupted during the evening before the game after Everton fans set off fireworks outside their hotel. Toney posted on Twitter after the match: ‘Lovely display from the boys but not as good as the fireworks late last night. ‘Normally I’m being woke up by my son but fireworks was a new one. Big three points! Fans right behind us. Onto next week. ‘And for the man that racially abused my family I’ll do everything I can to get you the punishment you deserve!’ Henry wrote on Twitter: ‘I never usually speak out on things that don’t physically harm me or my family but to see my mom upset after being racially abused by a few Everton fans brought fire to my stomach!’ Everton said in a statement: ‘There is no place in football – or society – for racism. We are assisting Merseyside Police to ensure the individual is identified and dealt with appropriately.’ Brentford said in a statement: ‘We are aware of an incident where racist abuse was directed towards family members of our players. A report has been made to both the police and to Everton FC. ‘Brentford FC condemns all forms of discrimination and racist abuse in the strongest possible terms. We will offer our support to Rico’s and Ivan’s families and will fully co-operate with the investigation and any subsequent legal proceedings.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
