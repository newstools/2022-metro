David Seaman says Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta is still ‘the right man’ for the job despite the Gunners’ poor end to the season. The north London side were in the driving seat in the race for the top four, until a costly defeat to Newcastle United on Monday evening. That result means Tottenham go into the final day of the Premier League season in fourth spot, leading the Gunners by two points. Spurs will secure Champions League football for next season unless they suffer a surprise defeat to relegated Norwich City on Sunday and Arsenal beat Everton. Although the Gunners look set to miss out on the top four for a third successive campaign under Arteta, Seaman is backing the Spaniard. ‘I still feel that Arteta’s the right man,’ the Arsenal legend, who occupies an informal coaching role at his former club, told the Seaman Says podcast. ‘I see what he does in training, his coaching methods and the intensity, passion and quality that he’s got. The demands he makes on the players are really high and for me, the team is getting better. ‘They need be top five again [by Christmas next season], they need to be going for Champions League. ‘It’s going to be difficult for them to be challenging for the Premier League because of the gap from Liverpool and Man City. ‘They need to be challenging, if they’re not, no matter who is the manager at Arsenal, there would be questions asked. ‘They need to be in a position to go for Europe. Europe should be the main aim every season, at least. If we’re not top five then there will be a lot of questions asked.’ MORE : ‘I don’t like it’ – Alan Shearer and Michael Owen give verdict on Granit Xhaka’s Arsenal outburst MORE : Juventus chief travels to London for talks with Arsenal over Gabriel Magalhaes, Arthur Melo and Weston McKennie For more stories like this, check our sport page.
