Bridgerton star Ruby Barker has been discharged from hospital after being admitted due to struggling with her mental health. The 25-year-old actress, who plays Marina Thompson on the Netflix series, reassured her followers that she ‘can’t wait for the future’ and thanked them for their support. Ruby’s update came after she had previously said she had been ‘really unwell for a really long time’ and felt like she was ‘carrying the weight of the world on my back.’ Speaking in a video recorded from a hot tub, Ruby said: ‘I can’t wait for the future. I’m doing okay for myself. I’m sat in a beautiful environment right now, taking some time for myself to relax and breathe.’ Sharing advice to her younger self, she continued: ‘Listen, it’s not all doom and gloom, even when you hit rock bottom.’ Ruby thanked NHS staff, her doctor, her loved ones and her Bridgerton family for their help, and gave a special mention to her co-star Claudia Jessie. ‘She told me to flip the coin,’ Ruby added. ‘It might be dull on one side, but just flip the coin and you’ll find it’s shiny on the other. ‘It’s training your mind to find the funny, to find the light, to find the positive. It’s a really hard thing to do, but if you can get into the practice of doing that, you’ve got it. ‘I just want everybody to feel good and to feel supported and loved and held and heard. Anybody that’s in a dark place right now, I just want you to know I see you I feel you. Find the funny and flip that coin.’ Ruby captioned her video, saying: ‘I’ve been discharged from hospital! Thank you so much for the support, I can’t wait for the future and I feel as if I’ve came out the other side. ‘Thank you everyone, have a blessed day 💜🙏🏽 take care of yourselves, don’t be afraid to check in with your loved ones and we’re all in this together as they say in High School Musical 🎶 😂 big big love.’ Last week, Ruby shared that she had been struggling amid the ‘existential threats’ as well as being ‘rage-filled, frustrated, angry’  before seeking help for ‘all this intergenerational trauma bundled up inside me’. She explained: ‘And now, I’m at a point where I have a diagnosis, and I will talk to you about that at another time. But I have a diagnosis, and I am relinquishing myself and forgiving myself and drawing a line in the sand. ‘I can’t carry on the way that I’ve been carrying on. I need to change. So, that’s what I’m trying to do.’ Bridgerton is available to stream on Netflix.
