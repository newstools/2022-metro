A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of between 6.1 and 6.6 has rocked the coast of Taiwan – but there is no danger of a tsunami. Taiwanese authorities said the earthquake, which struck at 3.23 pm on Monday, was 17 miles (27.5 kilometres) below the earth’s surface. The epicentre was recorded 55.6 miles off Taiwan’s east coast, roughly halfway between the coast of Hualien county and the southern Japanese island of Yonaguni, the country’s weather bureau said. The quake could be felt across Taiwan, the bureau added, with buildings briefly shaking in the capital city of Taipei. Japanese authorities said a magnitude 6.6 quake struck off the southern and westernmost island of Yonaguni, which is about 66 miles east of Taiwan. While the U.S. Geological Survey said it recorded a 6.3 magnitude quake in the area. Preliminary measurements of earthquakes often differ immediately after an event and can be revised after further analysis. There have been no immediate reports of damage following the earthquake. The Japan Meteorological Agency said there may be small swelling of the water following the quake but there is no danger of a tsunami. Taiwan lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes. More than 100 people were killed in a quake in southern Taiwan in 2016, while a 7.3 magnitude quake killed more than 2,000 people in 1999.
