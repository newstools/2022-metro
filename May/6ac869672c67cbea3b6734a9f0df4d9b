A red-faced council has promised to ‘try harder’ after leaving a glaring typo on a school’s new bus stop sign. Headmaster Chris Pyle, at Lancaster Royal Grammar School, noticed something was up when the word grammar was incorrectly spelled with an ‘e’. He then posted a picture on Twitter with the caption: ‘Umm.’ A flood of hilarious responses from teachers and former pupils soon swept in, with the school’s own Twitter page ordering the council to ‘write out Royal Grammar School 50 times!’ Lancashire County Council apologised for the ‘schoolboy error’ and promised to correct the sign over the coming days. A spokesperson said: ‘The irony of this unfortunate spelling error is not lost on the county council. ‘This schoolboy error does certainly not meet Lancaster Grammar’s exceptionally high standards. ‘Rest assured, we will correct this mistake and replace the bus stop plates over the coming days.’ ‘We’re glad people have been able to see the funny side and would like to reassure everyone that we will try harder in the future.’ Mr Pyle said he was delighted to have helped the council improve its English. He added: ‘We are enjoying the irony but will keep on trying to teach the world how to spell “grammar” correctly. ‘The new sign has definitely brought some laughter. Teachers are used to correcting spelling mistakes, and both pupils and teachers have enjoyed seeing this real world example on our doorstep.’ The selective grammar school for day pupils and boarders aged 11-18 was rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted in 2019. It is also one of the oldest in England, having been founded between 1235 and 1256. Notable former pupils include ex-cabinet minister Cecil Parkinson, Rugby coach Brian Ashton, Olympic Gold-winning cyclist Jason Queally, and comedian Jon Richardson.
