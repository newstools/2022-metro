Marcus Rashford is officially set to tie the knot after getting engaged to his childhood sweetheart Lucia Loi. The 24-year-old footballer confirmed the joyous news on his social media, posting a picture of the pair kissing in front of a giant love heart made of flowers, with candles and rose petals surrounding them. ‘24.05.22 🤍 @lucialoi,’ Marcus captioned the post, which was also shared on Lucia’s profile. Manchester United’s official Instagram account led the congratulations as celebrity friends and fellow sporting stars rushed to congratulate him. ‘So happy for you both,’ they wrote. Kidderminster Harriers midfielder Devonte Redmond penned: ‘Massive congrats to you both bro❤️🙌’ Dutch footballer Timothy Fosu-Mensah simply commented: ‘❤️💯🙏🏾.’ According to reports, Marcus had been planning the proposal for quite some time and popped the question during a romantic holiday in Hollywood. ‘They went out in LA for a romantic night together on Tuesday and he proposed there and then. It was extremely romantic,’ an insider said. They added to The Sun: ‘They celebrated afterwards with a group of close friends — including his Manchester United teammate Jesse Lingard.’ Marcus and Lucia started dating when he was just 15. The couple is thought to have split in February 2021 but were rumoured to have reconciled by December. ‘The intent for them to get back together has always been there,’ an insider said at the time. ‘The break was good for their relationship as it offered them both space and assurance that they wanted to make this work moving forward. ‘They have been together since school so an opportunity to breathe and focus on themselves was important.’ Another insider added to The Sun: ‘They have a shared history. She is one of the people who knows him best. They got back together before Christmas and are taking things slowly. ‘But they make each other happy and he knows she is loyal and he can trust her.’ Lucia has been photographed supporting Marcus at football games over the course of his career, including the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
