A luxury yacht moored at a Devon harbour has gone up in a ball of flames and sunk. The lavish vessel was engulfed by fire earlier this afternoon, sending a thick column of smoke into the sky. Torquay sea front was closed by emergency services while they got the situation under control. The boat was drifting around the water after flames burned through the ropes holding it in place. The boat involved appears to be a Princess yacht called Rendezvous, a model which usually sells on the market for around £2 million. Marine traffic tracking websites confirmed it was moored in the harbour since at least this morning. According to publicly available information, the expensive boat was built in 2010 in Plymouth. Ownership of the 85ft vessel last changed hands in 2010, according to superyachttimes.com. It is unclear who owns it. The 111 tonne boat is capable of carrying more than 8,000 litres of fuel. An Environment Agency spokesperson said: ‘Update on yacht fire in Torquay. With yacht now sunk, and with approx 9 tonnes of diesel on board, focus now on pollution. Pollution response led by harbour master. ‘Our officers are helping with advice and guidance on bathing water quality etc’. One man who saw the fire, Joseph Barlow, told the BBC it was ‘surreal’ to see the boat go up in flames. He said: ‘I heard a bang like a gun shot, from the harbour, followed by big plume of black smoke.’ Cat Johns, a local councillor, described the scene as ‘like a fireball’. A spokesperson from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said: ‘We currently have 5 fire appliances at Torquay marina fighting a fire on an 85ft private vessel. ‘Please do keep away from the area.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
