Cristiano Ronaldo is out of Manchester United’s clash against Crystal Palace on the final day of the season due to injury. The Portugal international would’ve been hoping to impress new boss Erik ten Hag, who will be in attendance at Selhurst Park on Sunday. The Athletic report that Ronaldo will miss the game due to a hip flexor issue, while Paul Pogba, who is expected to leave when his contract expires this summer, is also set to be absent. Ronaldo will end the season as United’s top scorer having found the back of the net 24 times across all competitions since his return to Old Trafford in the summer. The Red Devils will be looking to beat Palace on Sunday to ensure they finish in sixth place and secure Europa League football for next season. Ten Hag, who won the Eredivisie title with Ajax earlier this month, has already talked up the prospect of working under Ronaldo, ‘He is a true winner and a magnificent player. I can’t wait to work with him,’ said Ten Hag in his final interview with Ajax as their manager.’ Meanwhile, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner is excited about the Dutchman’s arrival and has wished his new manager well. ‘I know that he has done a fantastic job at Ajax, and that he is an experienced coach, but we have to give him time,’ Ronaldo told United’s official website. ‘Things must change the way he wants. ‘If he does well, all of Manchester United will be successful, so I wish him well. We are all happy and excited [about his arrival], not only as players, but as fans as well. ‘We have to believe that next year we can win titles.’ MORE : ‘A great leader’ – Erik ten Hag names Manchester United transfer target Jurrien Timber a future captain MORE : Manchester United staff tell Erik ten Hag to keep Marcus Rashford at Old Trafford For more stories like this, check our sport page.
