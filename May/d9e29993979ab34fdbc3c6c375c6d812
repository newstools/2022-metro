Today was officially the UK’s hottest day of the year so far, after temperatures peaked at 27.5C. The highest temperature was recorded at Heathrow near London this afternoon, the Met Office said. It beats the previous highest temperature recorded this year, which was 23.6C in Faversham, Kent, on May 6. The figure means that the UK was warmer than some popular holiday destinations like Santorini which only saw 26C today. But clouds and heavy rain in the west are expected to spread into central areas of the UK soon, the Met Office said. The hot weather was due to an air mass from the south bringing up mild air, particularly impacting areas in the South East. But temperatures are forecast to slowly decline as the week goes on and the air mass moves, bringing in fresher air and temperatures closer to the average for this time of year. The Met Office warned that ‘low pressure out to the west is driving some heavy rain across the UK in the next 24 hours’. They said a spell of heavy a rain will pass through tonight, with another spell of heavy rain and thunderstorms tomorrow evening. Heavy rain is set to move east giving some spray on the roads this evening, while the heavy showers could turn thundery across parts of the southeast.
