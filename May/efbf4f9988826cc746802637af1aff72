A New York City bus reportedly hit a man and drove off, leaving him unconscious and to die at the scene. The man, who has not been identified and is believed to be in his 50s, was discovered shortly before 5.30am on Friday at the intersection of Forest Hill Road and Platinum Avenue in Staten Island. He was not conscious. It appeared that his injuries came from being struck by a vehicle, New York police said. He died at the scene, a block away from the MTA Yukon Bus Depot, cops said. The vehicle did not stop after striking the man, according to a police spokeswoman who could not confirm that it was an MTA bus. However, a transit agency source told the New York Post that the vehicle involved was an MTA bus. An MTA spokesman confirmed to the newspaper that a bus on the SIM10 route hit the man at the same time and location that the accident was recorded. The spokesman declined to comment on the vehicle leaving the scene. No information has been released about the bus driver. Staten Island is one of New York City’s five boroughs and lies south of Manhattan. It comes five months after an MTA bus struck and killed a man in the Queens borough. MD Nazmul Ahsan, 63, was crossing Broadway near Roosevelt Avenue in the Jackson Heights neighborhood against the pedestrian signal at night when a bus struck him with its front bumper and knocked him to the ground, according to the Post. Ahsan suffered head trauma and was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The 54-year-old bus driver, who had a green light, stayed at the scene, cops said. He was not injured. No arrest was immediately made in the December 21 incident, as an investigation ensued. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
