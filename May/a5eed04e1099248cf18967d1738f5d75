Every passenger on a 15-person ‘party bike’ was taken to hospital after it crashed and overturned, with the driver charged for driving under the influence. Two people have been left critically injured, while three others are in a ‘serious condition’ after the incident in Georgia. The ‘pedal pub’ tipped over while attempting to make a turn at the intersection of 14th and West Peachtree Street in Atlanta. No other vehicles were involved. Originally invented in the Netherlands, party bikes allow riders to enjoy drinks while they pedal around cities. Operators sit at the front to control the devices, which are popular for birthdays and hen parties. One alarmed witness, who saw passengers trapped by the vehicle, told Local 12: ‘I was just laying in bed, and then I heard several screams.’ Footage captured red cups and other debris strewn across the street as riders waited for emergency services to arrive. James Anthony Johnson, 28, was arrested at around 6.30pm on Saturday. His alleged actions have also led to a business permit violation charge. ‘This is a unique challenge, simply because it’s a multi-casualty incident,’ Atlanta Fire Battalion Chief Jason McClain said. ‘This is not an everyday call, although we do train for these incidents.’ The franchisor of the independently owned and operated pedal pubs around the US said customer safety was staff’s ‘top priority’. In a statement sent to cbs46, Todd Treml, president of Pedal Pub Development, said: ‘We were shocked and saddened to learn of the situation involving one of the independently owned and operated franchises in Atlanta. ‘Pedal Pub Development is thankful to the bystanders and first responders who rushed into action. ‘We will continue to follow the updates involving the Atlanta franchise, keeping all those who are impacted in our thoughts and prayers.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
