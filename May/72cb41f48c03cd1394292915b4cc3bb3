Katie Price appeared in court today where she pleaded guilty to breaching a restraining order. The 44-year-old glamour model attended a hearing at Lewes Crown Court in Sussex on Wednesday, accompanied by fiance Carl Woods, where she was warned that she faces jail time. During the proceedings, Price pleaded guilty to breaching a restraining order against her ex-husband Kieran Hayler’s fiancee Michelle Penticost. Price previously denied the breach at a court hearing in April at Crawley Magistrates Court. The former I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here star arrived at court holding hands with car dealer Woods, who sat in the public gallery watching on for support. Price was accused of sending ex-husband Hayler a message on January 21, in which she branded his new partner Penticost, a ‘c***ing wh**e’ and a ‘gutter s**g’, while also accusing them of having an affair. The message read: ‘Tell your ****ing wh**e, piece of s**t, girlfriend not to start on me. ‘She has a restraining order so shouldn’t try antagonise me as she is in breach and I’m sure she doesn’t want people knowing that she was having an affair with you behind my back. That gutter s**g.’ After her guilty plea, Judge Stephen Mooney warned Price: ‘Clearly you have accepted responsibility for this offence and that you indirectly tried to communicate Ms Penticost despite her restraining order against you. ‘I must warn you Ms Price that you are at risk of going to prison.’ Nicholas Hamblin, defending, said Price had been ‘subject to various conditions’ at the time of the offence. Judge Mooney said he will ‘need to know’ the background before considering Price’s sentence. She was bailed ahead of sentencing on June 24. The mum-of-five was banned from contacting Penticost directly or indirectly on June 3, 2019, under the terms of a five-year restraining order while also being fined £415 for hurling a foul-mouthed ‘tirade of abuse’ at her during a row in a school playground. During the court hearing last month, where Price denied the claims, her defending lawyer Joe Harrington, said: ‘The issues relate to her mental health and the triggers which led to sending that message.’ District Judge Amanda Kelly said the offence carries a maximum sentence of up to five years’ imprisonment and warned Price at the time: ‘You are in really grave danger of going to prison. ‘This is a very serious allegation in which it is alleged you used indirectly vile and nasty language towards Ms Penticost, someone you were prohibited from contacting directly or indirectly by a restraining order.’ Price married Hayler in 2013 but the pair split in 2018 with their divorce finalised in 2021. She is currently engaged to former Love Island star Woods, while Hayler proposed to Penticost in 2020. Got a story?
