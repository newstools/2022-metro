A pub landlord has decided to chop his profits to help struggling families through the cost of living crisis. The Ivor Hael Hotel in Llwynypia, south Wales, has decided to offer meals to those with food bank vouchers for as low as 50p. Dishes include spaghetti bolognese, bangers and mash, shepherd’s pie, sausage casserole and chicken curry costing between 50p and 80p. Landlord Chris Jones, 32, said: ‘Last week one of the regulars came into the pub and they began explaining to one of the staff how they were really struggling. ‘We gave them some free food and began talking about it. More and more people have come in saying similar things. ‘We could never commit to doing it for free but we knew we wanted to do something that could make a difference.’ He admitted he is only just about breaking even on the meals but it felt like the right thing to do. ‘We are managing to get back to normal now after Covid and we can pay staff wages and keep the lights on, so we’re in a position where we can help people in the area,’ Chris added. He said the meals could also be served frozen for people to take home with them. ‘It was the least we could do,’ he said. ‘I saw something the other day about a friend’s electricity bill going from £90 a month to £300. I see it on Facebook all the time. ‘I know one woman who is literally selling her clothes to pay for her kids to eat. It’s crazy. ‘We shouldn’t forget that we couldn’t do this unless we were busy too. ‘The fact that our customers have always supported us and we’re busy makes it possible for us to do things like this.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
