A man has denied assaulting former Conservative party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith by putting a traffic cone on his head. Elliot Bovill, 31, is alleged to have attacked the 68-year-old politician during a Tory party conference on October 4 last year in Manchester. Sir Iain was followed by protestors after leaving his hotel with wife Betsy and a friend, Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard. Outlining the allegation, prosecutor Sudara Weerasena said: ‘Mr Bovill approaches Sir Iain Duncan Smith and he has a traffic cone, which he places on Sir Iain Duncan Smith’s head and then he runs off’. Bovill, from Manchester, appeared in the dock where he denied a single count of assault by beating. He faces a two-day trial alongside Radical Haslam, 28, from Manchester, and Ruth Wood, 50, from Cambridge, who both denied using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause Sir Iain harassment, alarm or distress. Wood is said to have been banging a drum when she allegedly called the former work and pensions secretary ‘Tory scum’ and told him: ‘Get out of Manchester, you’re not welcome.’ Meanwhile, the court heard Haslam, carrying a board reading ‘Not fit to govern’, told Sir Iain: ‘You should be ashamed of yourself.’ Chief magistrate Paul Goldspring said Sir Iain, who led the Conservatives from 2001 and 2003, was likely to be required to give evidence at the trial, which will be held in Manchester. He granted all three defendants unconditional bail and told them they are not required to attend the next hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, where a trial date will be fixed. Following the incident last year, Sir Iain told The Spectator magazine he was struck on the back of the head with a traffic cone as he headed to a fringe event, while a friend said he escaped without injury.
