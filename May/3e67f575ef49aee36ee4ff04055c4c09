Erik ten Hag has instructed Manchester United to beat Barcelona and Arsenal to a deal for Wolves midfielder Ruben Neves, according to reports. Ten Hag has been in the Old Trafford hot-seat for less than a week but has already identified a number of targets ahead of this summer’s transfer window. The Dutch coach, who won the Eredivisie with Ajax last season, wants to sign a new striker, midfielder and centre-back and has identified Neves as a top target. Portugal international Neves has made more than 200 appearances for Wolves and been one of the key players at Molineux since his £16m move from Porto in 2017. Manchester United first expressed interest in signing Neves while Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was in charge and considered a move for the 25-year-old in January. The Sun say Ten Hag has told United to revive their interest, with the Premier League giants now set to make a final push to secure a deal. Wolves valued Neves at around £40m at the start of the year but now want close to £50m for the Portuguese star. His contract at the Midlands club runs until 2024 but Neves has shown a reluctance to sign a new deal as he look to secure a big move. Barcelona are also in the running to sign Neves and can offer him Champions League football unlike United, while Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta is believed to be a fan and keen to bring him to the Emirates.  Speaking after Wolves’ final game of the season, Neves suggested he would be open to leaving the club this summer. He said: ‘The only thing I can tell you at the moment is that everyone knows what football is about, what our lives are about. Our career is really short and we need to take the opportunities we have. ‘All of us have dreams and we need to live those dreams in a small space of time. Let’s see what happens, I cannot say too much about it.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
