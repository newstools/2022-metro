Will Young has opened up on the agony of throwing his twin brother Rupert out of his house just one week before he took his own life. Rupert died by suicide in July 2020 aged 41 after falling from Westminster bridge. He had suffered a long battle with depression and an addiction to alcohol and painkillers. Will reflected on the pain of his sibling’s addiction in his new Channel 4 documentary, Will Young: Losing My Twin Rupert, and admitted he ‘had a big moment where I realised I couldn’t save him.’ Shortly before Rupert died, Will had reported him as a trespasser and had him removed from his home. ‘At the end, he would be drinking 24 hours a day,’ he shared. ‘You’ve got this monster who’s not moving. So, the only thing was to throw him out but also to be aware he might end up killing himself. I was ok with everything I’d done to try to help him.’ The Leave Right Now singer also was a carer for his brother before he died. ‘My day would start. Either he was sick or he would have peed on the sofa, so I’d have to clear that up, then go get more beers and codeine because he was addicted to painkillers.’ Rupert had lived with Will on and off for three years and had no other support system or friends, an inquest revealed. Speaking about how he felt after Rupert had died, Will said: ‘I had a big moment where I realised I couldn’t save him and that brought a whole lot of grief. Now I just feel very grateful that I got 42 years with him. ‘I did everything I could to not let him die’. Rupert died on July 30, 2020, days after he was admitted to Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital on July 28, when he had been seen walking on the edge of a bridge. St Pancras Coroner’s Court was told he had been admitted to hospital four times in the week prior to his death, as he struggled with alcoholism and his mental health. Will Young: Losing My Twin Rupert airs tonight at 9pm on Channel 4.
