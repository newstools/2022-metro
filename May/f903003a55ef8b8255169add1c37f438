A man is due in court after a Newcastle fan was filmed allegedly urinating on a statue outside Sunderland’s Stadium of Light. Thomas Fleet, 21, was charged with disorderly conduct and criminal damage after footage of the incident went viral. The video appeared to show a man in a Newcastle United shirt urinating on the memorial of Sunderland legend Bob Stokoe outside the stadium. Fleet is due to appear before magistrates in South Tyneside today. The beloved statue captures Stokoe’s famous dance across Wembley after masterminding the club’s FA Cup final victory over Leeds United. Ironically, Stokoe is also a hero on Tyneside, having made 261 appearances for Newcastle and winning the FA Cup in 1955. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
