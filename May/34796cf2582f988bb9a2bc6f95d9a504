Manaskin singer Damiano David dropped a cheeky reference to last year’s drugs controversy as the band returned to the Eurovision stage. As the 2021 final unfolded, footage began circulating online showing Damiano bending towards the table which led many to speculate that he was using cocaine. The band – who won the event – were forced to deny the allegations, with the singer later taking a drugs test which dismissed the claims. And after performing their new song Supermodel on the stage in Turin tonight, Damiano couldn’t help but mention the controversy of last year, when he was asked if he had any advice for the finalists of this year’s competition. He said to the crowd: ‘Two [bits of] advice, have fun and don’t get close to the table, guys. ‘Don’t do it.’ Chiming in with commentary, Graham Norton added: ‘If you don’t know what he’s talking about, Google it.’ The Italian band, led by Damiano David, with Victoria De Angelis on bass, Thomas Raggi on guitar, and Ethan Torchio on drums, took home the trophy with their song Zitti E Buoni brought Turin an electric performance of their new track, which was only released yesterday. Ahead of their performance the lead singer of the Italian rock group has reassured fans he will still be in fine form despite using crutches following an ankle injury. Sharing a clip of himself with a beauty face mask on, the I Wanna Be Your Slave hitmaker wrote on his Instagram Story: ‘My ankle is bad but my skin can still be perfect.’ In another post, he added: ‘Tomorrow we’ll smash the stage anyways, don’t worry 4 me. Love y’all. (sic)’
