An 18-year-old has died while digging a hole on a beach with his sister. Levy Caverley and his sibling, 17, dug the hole using frisbees on a beach in Toms River, New Jersey just after 4pm yesterday. They dug 10ft deep before the sand gave way, trapping both of them, killing Levy. Witnesses frantically tried to free the teenagers, who were visiting with their family, and the girl was saved. His sister was rescued from the hole at around 7pm and treated for injuries at the scene, according to NBC New York. The Caverley family were visiting the New Jersey beach town from Maine when the tragedy struck. The family had spent the afternoon at Ocean Beach III, a private beach community. Crews worked to rescue the teens using boards and buckets. The death is being investigated. Authorities said no life guards were on duty at the time, as lifeguards are typically not hired to patrol the beaches until Memorial Day Weekend. In Utah, a 13-year-old boy died over the weekend after a tunnel he had been digging in a sand dune collapsed on him. Ian Spendlove was buried alive at the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park in Kanab, Utah on Saturday after the deep tunnel he was digging fell. Relatives and park officials frantically dug for the teen, who they found unconscious. He was airlifted to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead.
