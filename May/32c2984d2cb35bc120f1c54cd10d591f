England have named a 14-man squad for the upcoming ODI series against the Netherlands. Eoin Morgan’s World Cup winners will play three one-day internationals against the Netherlands in Amstelveen, a suburban part of the Amsterdam metropolitan area, starting on June 17. Lancashire bowler Luke Wood and Gloucestershire paceman David Payne are the two uncapped players named in the squad. This is Wood’s first call-up to the senior squad, while Payne has been involved previously in last summer’s ODIs against Pakistan. New England white-ball coach Matthew Mott said: ‘I’m very excited to be coaching a strong squad for my first series in charge. We have tremendous depth with a blend of youth and experience. ‘We want to continue to play in an expressive style and let our players showcase their skills and firepower. ‘Luke Wood deserves his call-up. He has been consistent for Lancashire over the past 12 months and we have been monitoring his progression. If given a chance to play, I’m sure he will make most of his opportunity. ‘This is a historic occasion for the sport and the first time England Men have played The Netherlands in an ODI series. We can’t wait to head over to Amsterdam and put on a show for the thousands of fans travelling to support the team. ‘The ODI side has had limited opportunities and last played in July. However, with about 18 months to the next ICC 50 over World Cup in India, our preparation will start ramping up with nine matches over the summer and a busy winter ahead against strong opponents.’ England’s trip to Amsterdam starts a busy period for the team, who play white-ball series against India and South Africa later in the summer.
