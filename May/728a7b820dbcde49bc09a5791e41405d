The Duchess of Sussex’s half-sister claims Meghan has not spoken to her father since he suffered a major stroke, but the ‘door is wide open’. Thomas Markle, 77, fell ill last week ahead of his planned trip to the UK for the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. The retired Hollywood lighting director was rushed to a hospital near his home in Rosarito, Mexico, before being transferred to a medical facility in California. He was discharged over the weekend but can only speak a few words and faces ‘an uphill battle’ to talk again. Samantha Markle appeared on Good Morning Britain after reports emerged claiming Meghan had ‘reached out’ to her estranged dad, who she has not seen for several years. GMB host Richard Madeley asked if she had seen any signs of the duchess trying to contact him.  ‘We have not,’ she said. ‘I heard rumours that she was trying to reach out to my dad’s camp, but my brother and I are my dad’s camp, and his phone number has never changed, his address has never changed. ‘Even though he can’t speak, his language comprehension is perfect. She could text him. She could contact him, and he can text back.’ She added: ‘Those rumours are not true. She has not reached out.’ Ms Markle was then asked whether her dad will fly to London and attempt to reconcile with Meghan and Harry on camera. ‘Well, who told you about that plan?’ she responded. ‘It sounds like the PR staff were drinking too much mercury in the water.’ Ms Markle added her father is ‘rebounding remarkably well’ after his stroke and feels ‘blessed to be alive’.
