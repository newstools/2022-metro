Four people have been stabbed in an attack in Numedal, south-east Norway. Local police say numerous injuries have been reported, and one person remains in a critical condition. Officers were called to the village of Nore, within the Numedal valley, early this morning to reports of an ‘ongoing life-threatening incident’. The attack took place near to Joker Egedahl, a grocery store in the village. The knifeman has now been arrested. A police spokesperson told Reuters: ‘I can confirm we have the offender under control.’ Police in Norway branded the incident ‘PLIVO’ in their initial response – at around 9am this morning – which stands for ‘ongoing life-threatening violence.’ Several ambulances and an air ambulance were called to the scene this morning. Delivery driver William Scott told Norway’s VG newspaper he saw an injured woman on the ground. He said: ‘At first I thought it was a collision because there was a large pool of blood on the ground.’ The attack comes just a day after Espen Andersen Bråthen went on trial for the murder of five people and attempted murder of 11 more on October 13, 2021. Armed with a bow, he carried out his rampage in the Norwegian town of Kongsberg, also within the country’s Numedal region. In total, he killed five people aged 52-78, including four women. Bråthen, originally from Denmark, had been listed by Norwegian security services as a person of concern as early as 2015. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
