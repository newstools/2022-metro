Manchester United star David De Gea has told any team-mates that do not wish to stay at the club to leave Old Trafford this summer. The Red Devils ended a dismal season with a 1-0 defeat at Crystal Palace, meaning United finish the campaign with their lowest ever Premier League points tally and a goal difference of zero. Erik ten Hag was in the stands at Selhurst Park today and he’s expected to meet the squad next week before his work really gets started at the Theatre of Dreams. There’s a huge job on the Dutchman’s hands, with a disjointed, discontent squad at the club. De Gea has been one of the few plus points of United’s season and he is perhaps the only first-team squad member guaranteed a spot under Ten Hag. The Spaniard is usually laid-back but even he was peeved after the end of a ‘horrible’ season and he’s advised any players that do not want to be at the club to exit in the transfer window. ‘The best thing that happened today is the season has finished,’ said De Gea. ‘I cannot wait [to work with Ten Hag]. I am excited for the next season, new manager, and new players.” ‘Hopefully, we will improve and put Manchester United in a better position. We need to trust in the future.” ‘The new manager and staff are already looking for new players. Hopefully, they bring good ones with good character.” ‘Ones who want to stay, stay at the club. Ones that don’t want to stay go out. You don’t have to stay here. ‘I want to forget this season and be 100% ready for the next season and be positive. ‘It has been horrible, a very bad season in all ways, it has been very tough. It is time to rest and prepare your minds for next season.’ MORE : Leeds United survive as Burnley are relegated after six seasons in the Premier League For more stories like this, check our sport page.
