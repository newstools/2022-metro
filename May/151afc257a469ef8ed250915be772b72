Got a thing for Vikings? You might want to visit York for the Jorvik Viking Festival, which celebrates all things Norse-themed… or browse our pictures of yesterday’s highlights. Running until Wednesday, the festival is attended by Viking fans who want to dress up in appropriate attire. As well as the visual spectacle, traders will be selling produce and entertainment will be held – all inspired by Nordic history. Attendees can look forward to a living history encampment, a march to Coppergate, a Strongest Viking competition and Best Beard contest. Usually the event is held in February, but it was pushed back due to the pandemic. Gareth Henry, an event manager said: ‘In February, our evening spectacular is usually a dramatic presentation of a Viking story, but with the evenings being so much lighter in May, our event will also be a little more fun. ‘The Viking Games will pit the finest warriors from four teams against each other, with spectators invited to pick their champion and cheer them on to victory.’ To see the best dressed after yesterday’s opening, keep scrolling.
