A British 16-year-old has reportedly been arrested on suspicion of raping a British girl of the same age in Majorca. The girl’s mum is said to have stopped the alleged sex attack after walking in as it happened in a room at an unnamed hotel in a resort on the east coast of the holiday island. She raised the alarm by screaming, summoning concerned staff yesterday. Local reports say the incident is at the centre of an ongoing investigation, which is being led by the Civil Guard. Island newspaper Ultima Hora said the girl had gone to her room with the teenage boy she had met the same day and consented to kissing him before deciding she didn’t want to go any further. It said she had told detectives he had reacted by turning violent and pushed her on the bed before forcing himself on her. She is believed to have checked into he hotel with her family several days earlier. The unnamed British teen arrested is said to be in police cells in the town of Manacor following his arrest and under normal circumstances will be quizzed by a youth court judge in the coming hours. The Civil Guard has been contacted for an official comment. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
