Holly Willoughby reached her last nerve with Patrice Evra in tonight’s episode of Freeze the Fear With Wim Hof as she ordered him to remove himself from a hole of ice water. It all kicked off when the former Manchester United and French international football player refused to get out of the freezing cold pool, despite being told he had to for safety reasons. This Morning presenter Holly didn’t have any time for Patrice’s stubbornness and upon hearing his rebuttal, firmly stated: ‘Patrice, your body temperature is dropping, we’re going to have to get you out.’ However, the sports star continued to push back and remained in the water, prompting Holly to storm over to where he was submerged. ‘But it’s dangerous,’ she told him. ‘It’s dangerous. You’ve got to get out. You have to get out.’ As she approached Patrice, Holly signalled one last time: ‘You’ve got to get out.’ At this point, he proceeded to get out of the ice bath. ‘I was literally going to come in there and get you,’ she quipped. Turning to co-star, comedian Lee Mack, Holly added: ‘I was about to go full-on mum on him!’ As Patrice sheepishly made his way out of the water, it was revealed that he had been submerged for over 15 minutes. ‘I don’t know my limits,’ he later told the presenters. ‘I was there and in control of my body, it’s weird.’ Freeze The Fear With Wim Hof sees a group of celebrities embark on an epic adventure of self-improvement, and face a unique test of mental strength like no other. Singer Professor Green, Strictly Come Dancing professional Dianne Buswell and TV presenter Gabby Logan are also taking part, along with Alfie Boe, Owain Wyn Evans, Chelcee Grimes and Tamzin Outhwaite. Freeze The Fear With Wim Hof continues on Tuesday at 9pm on BBC One. Got a story?
