Male players at Wimbledon this year will not receive ranking points following the decision to ban Russian and Belarusian stars from this summer’s tournament. In late April, the All England Club announced that players from the two nations would not be admitted entry to this summer’s championships following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The ATP, which oversees men’s tennis, says the decision undermines players qualifying for the tournament on merit. Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic are among those to have criticised the ban which sees world no.2 Daniil Medvedev unable to compete at SW19. An ATP statement read: ‘The ability for players of any nationality to enter tournaments based on merit, and without discrimination, is fundamental to our Tour. ‘The decision by Wimbledon to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing in the UK this summer undermines this principle and the integrity of the ATP Ranking system. ‘It is also inconsistent with our Rankings agreement. ‘Absent a change in circumstances, it is with great regret and reluctance that we see no option but to remove ATP Ranking points from Wimbledon for 2022.’ The All England Club said last month that it acknowledged their decision would be ‘hard’ on some players and that it was ‘with sadness that they will suffer for the actions of the leaders of the Russian regime’.
