Arsenal defender Gabriel Magalhaes has endorsed Arsenal’s push to sign Gabriel Jesus from Manchester City. Mikel Arteta wants to sign at least one new striker this summer after losing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in the January transfer window, while Alexandre Lacazette is also set to leave when his contract expires at the end of June. Arsenal have identified Jesus as one of their priority targets and have already held talks with the City forward’s agent. The Gunners face strong competition to sign Jesus and Arteta, who worked with the 25-year-old at City, could miss out after his side’s failure to secure a place in next season’s Champions League. But Gabriel Magalhaes is keen for Arsenal to complete a deal for his Brazil teammate. ‘We play in the same dressing room, but nothing is certain,’ Gabriel Magalhaes said during a press conference with Brazil’s national team on Sunday. ‘He is certainly a quality player and, if he goes to Arsenal, he will help us a lot.’ Speaking after helping City win the Premier League title last weekend, Jesus admitted his future remains uncertain but suggested he has told the club that he is keen to leave. ‘I have a contract with City and I have already expressed my desire to the City people and to my agent. I have in my head very clear what I want,’ said Jesus. ‘Today, I want to celebrate a lot with City. It’s obvious that I’m very happy here. Tomorrow, if everything goes well for me, my wife and our family, Helena [his daughter] will come to the world. ‘So, I have to take advantage of this moment. Then, think about the team, smile at the team again. And, on vacation, I decide about my future.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
