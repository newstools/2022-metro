An investigation is under way after a man was attacked by a man shouting homophobic slurs. The 55-year-old was struck over the head while walking with friends in South London. The perpetrator ran off after carrying out what the Met has described as a ‘serious homophobic assault’. It happened in Burgess Park at around 1.40 am this morning, according to the force. The victim was approached by a stranger who abused him verbally before physically attacking him. His condition is not life-threatening but he required hospital treatments. Police believe the attacker left along Albany Road before officers arrived. Officers wish to speak with a man who was seen on CCTV on the road around the time of the incident. He is a young man, possibly aged in his early 20s, who was wearing a stud earring and carrying a plastic JD Sports string bag on his back. A Met spokesperson said ‘even though his face cannot be seen in this image, it is hoped that somebody will recognise the man’. Commander Dr Alison Heydari said: ‘We have made it clear that tackling violent crime is the Met’s top priority and we are seeing positive results. ‘This sort of violence will not be tolerated, all the more so when exacerbated by a homophobic motive. ‘Officers from the Met’s Central South BCU are already working at pace to identify the man responsible for this attack. ‘I can assure Londoners that our investigation will be thorough, well-resourced and as painstaking as necessary to bring the individual responsible to justice.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
