Most organisations – if they weren’t doing it already – moved to meetings on video calls at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. And although that was more than two years ago, it appears some people still mess it up. Take councillor Dorian Phillips for example, who recently made the rookie error of assuming he was on mute when he actually wasn’t. The Plaid Cymru representative for Carmarthenshire County Council suddenly blurted out ‘f***ing swallow that, you f***ers’ on a Zoom call. But he has since insisted it was not aimed at fellow councillors. He said: ‘I cannot deny that I used profane language, but it was not directed at anyone at that meeting. ‘During the session, I had to deal with a non-council business conversation which became very heated, in which colourful language was used. ‘I was horrified to learn that my microphone was turned on and the impression given that I was addressing the meeting. This was certainly not the case. ‘I deeply regret that this happened and I’m dismayed it should be seen as being directed at fellow councillors.’ He referred himself to the public service ombudsman, but Labour councillors have called on him to be suspended from Plaid Cymru by party leader Adam Price. Labour councillor Rob James said: ‘This is truly appalling behaviour from an elected councillor and has really upset a number of councillors in attendance. ‘We are calling on Adam Price to condemn this behaviour and suspend him from the party pending investigation.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
