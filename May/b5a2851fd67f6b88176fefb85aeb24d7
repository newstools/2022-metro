The opening of the Elizabeth line has been a long time coming for London’s passionate rail fans. They have endured three and a half years of delays, but as of 6.33am this morning, were finally allowed to take a pew on the sparkling new tube line. In a bid to cash in on the enthusiasm, the London Transport Museum set up a stall at Paddington station with a very interesting range of merchandise. Anyone looking to chill in style at the beach this summer can bag themselves an official Elizabeth line deckchair – all yours for £165. A £9 pair of socks and £8 face covering are some of the items on the cheaper end of the scale. Tube fans on a larger budget might be tempted by the luggage bag or throw – both priced at £95. But the real big spenders can order their own Lizzie line sofa for £2,500, featuring the exact same moquette fabric. Rail fans were out in force today, even wearing purple clothes in honour of the big occasion. But the grand opening got off to a shaky start as the platforms were evacuated due to a fire alert at Paddington. The British Transport Police said the evacuation was a precautionary mesure and the station is back open. The Elizabeth line was due to be completed in December 2018 and was set a budget of £14.8billion in 2010. It was postponed indefinitely when it became clear its completion was nowhere near ready. The total cost is now estimated at £18.9billion, including £5.1billion from the government. Capacity is set to get a major boost on the Underground, while journey times are cut across the capital. It will stretch from Reading in Berkshire and Heathrow Airport in west London to Shenfield in Essex and Abbey Wood in south-east London. Trains will initially operate in three sections, which are expected to be integrated in the autumn. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
