A DIY enthusiast gave her parents’ bedroom a much-needed makeover for just £250. Lifestyle influencer Nicole – who goes by Elocin_Home on Instagram – was given a £300 budget from her parents to reinvent their bedroom. ‘Before this project, the bedroom hadn’t seen a lick of paint in 10 years,’ the 32-year-old tells Metro.co.uk. In a short video shared to Instagram, Nicole shows how she transformed the bedroom using DIY wood panelling and some simple decor. To start, she gave the room a fresh coat of white paint – to make it feel airy and spacious. Then, using moulding strips and architrave (the moulding that usually sits around door and window frames), Nicole added a burst of character to the room in the form of wooden panelling, which she then painted a slightly darker nutmeg white. The finishing touches were adding ornaments, pictures and prints on top of the panelling on the back wall – which doubles up as a shelf  – and adding a rug under the bed. After, she simply added in some new bedding and the room was complete. All in all, the project cost £250 (not including the bed, which was a gift) and took three days to complete. ‘It was absolutely worth it as my parents are over the moon with it,’ says Nicole. This is just one of many DIY projects for Nicole. ‘I’ve been doing little DIY projects for the last eight years and I absolutely love it,’ she says. ‘I use it to escape daily life stresses and if I can find ways and hacks to make something look luxurious on a budget, I love to show others how to do it, too.’ Do you have a story to share?
