Summer is just around the corner and, as a result, many people will be jet-setting off to all kinds of exciting destinations – after two years of on and off restrictions. But any trip away means our houseplants are left to fend for themselves – especially if you don’t have a friend or neighbour who can pop in and water them. Thankfully, someone on TikTok has shared a genius trick for watering plant babies while you’re on holiday – so months, or even years, of hard nurturing work don’t go to waste. Justine Shannon – of the TikTok account @selfcareplants – has revealed a simple trick that involves some string, or wick, and a saucepan of water. Justine’s first TikTok video involves her setting the experiment up, before she goes on holiday. She can be seen filling a saucepan of water and getting a piece of cotton macrame cord for each plant. Then she pops one end of the cord in the water pan  – which she notes must be higher than the plants – and the other deep into the soil. Justine does this for each of her plants, so they sit around the water pan with their individual cords in it. This allows the plants to suck up water via the cord – in a similar way to a straw. A follow-up video shows her coming back from her 12-day holiday to find the saucepan almost empty. ‘I’m happy to report the plants are happy and thriving,’ she says. So there you have it, a simple hack that means you no longer have to worry about coming back to peaky-looking plants. Do you have a story to share?
