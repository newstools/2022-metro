Jurgen Klopp maintains Liverpool’s title chances are ‘unlikely’ following his side’s 2-1 victory over Southampton on Tuesday evening. Liverpool went behind at St Mary’s through Nathan Redmon’s early goal but Takumi Minamino netted an equaliser before Joel Matip headed the winner in the 67th minute. The result means Liverpool are now just a point behind leaders Manchester City ahead of the final day of the season on Sunday. Liverpool host Wolves at Anfield, while City play Aston Villa at the Etihad Stadium. But Klopp insists City remain on course to win the Premier League title once again. Asked if still rates Liverpool’s title chances as unlikely, Klopp told BBC Sport: ‘Of course it is unlikely because City play at home against Aston Villa, who play only on Thursday. It will be tough against Burnley, they fight for survival. ‘But it is football. I think the time when City became champion [in 2019] it was because of 11 millimetres. ‘If someone wants us to be champion then we have to win first and Aston Villa need to get a point at City. ‘It is possible, not likely but possible. That is enough.’ James Milner said of Liverpool’s title run-in with City: ‘We will try and win our game, it is all we can do.” ‘City are an incredible team to go up against. Whatever happens we’ve done ourselves proud. All we can do is try to win our games. ‘It wasn’t going to be easy after the weekend. Hopefully we can have two more big performances.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
