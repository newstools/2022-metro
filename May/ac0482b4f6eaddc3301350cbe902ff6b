One of Putin’s top diplomats has resigned saying he has never been so ‘ashamed’ of his country. Boris Bondarevsent sent his colleagues at the United Nations in Geneva a damning letter denouncing the ‘aggressive war unleashed’ by the Russian president. The veteran bureaucrat’s outburst is a rare public expression of opposition to Putin from the ranks of the Russian elite. But it follows a trend of brave Russians speaking out, three months to the day Putin sent his troops into Ukraine. Just last week, thousands of people suddenly began chanting ‘f*** the war’ at a packed concert hall in St Petersburg. Mr Bondarev told the Associated Press: ‘It is intolerable what my government is doing now.’ He said those who conceived the war ‘want only one thing – to remain in power forever, live in pompous tasteless palaces, sail on yachts comparable in tonnage and cost to the entire Russian navy, enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity’. Mr Bondarev also said Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is all about ‘warmongering, lies and hatred’. On the battlefield, Russian forces stepped up their bombardment of the Donbas, the eastern industrial heartland of coal mines and factories the Kremlin is so bent on capturing. Cities not under Russian control are constantly shelled, with one Ukrainian official accusing Putin’s forces of targeting civilians trying to flee. Donetsk’s regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said three civilians died in Russian attacks on Monday as heavy fighting continued near the Luhansk region. He said the Russians were devastating cities in their attempt to take over. Only about 320,000 people out of the region’s pre-war population of 1.6 million still remain. ‘They are killing us. They are killing the locals during evacuation,’ Mr Kyrylenko added. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
