A couple accused of killing their four-month-old baby have been pictured for the first time as they appeared in court for a pre-trial review. Kayleigh Driver, 29, and Michael Davis, 27, have denied murdering their son Oliver Davis. He died on October 21, 2017, at a home in Beaumont Leys, Leicester. Davis and Driver, both of Leicester, are also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, two counts of causing grievous bodily harm, and causing or allowing a child to suffer serious physical harm.
