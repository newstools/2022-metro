Manchester United have congratulated their incoming manager Erik ten Hag after he guided Ajax to a third Eredivisie title. Ajax clinched the Dutch title with one game to spare after thumping Heerenveen 5-0 at the Johan Cruyff Arena on Wednesday night. The victory sent Ajax four points clear of title rivals PSV Eindhoven ahead of Sunday’s final round of games. It was a the perfect farewell for Ten Hag, who was unveiled as Manchester United’s next manager in April. After Ajax’s title win, a statement on the United website said: ‘Our future manager Erik ten Hag won his third Eredivisie title with Ajax on Wednesday evening. ‘Ten Hag has a reputation as an attack-minded manager and that has certainly been evident with his side this term. Ajax have an impressive goal difference of 79, having scored 96 goals in the league so far. ‘Perhaps even more impressive is the defensive resilience of Ten Hag’s team. In 33 matches, Ajax have conceded a mere 17 goals, 15 fewer than the next nearest team. ‘Off the back of the Dutchman’s latest success, we look forward to welcoming Ten Hag to Old Trafford next season. Congratulations, Erik!’ Ten Hag, who joined Ajax in December 2017, will become Manchester United’s fifth permanent manager since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. The 52-year-old has signed a three-year deal at Old Trafford and will replace interim boss Ralf Rangnick, who has been in charge since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s sacking in November. A number of Ajax’s title-winners have been linked with moves to Old Trafford following Ten Hag’s appointment but the Dutchman has played down the prospect of bringing several of his current players to England. ‘No, there are no agreements about that,’ said Ten Hag when asked if Ajax would allow United to poach some of their star players. ‘I now have very good players, but it’s not an issue at all.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
