Boris Johnson will finally appear on Good Morning Britain for the first time in five years, it’s been confirmed. The Prime Minister has been noticeably absent from GMB, with presenters Susanna Reid and former host Piers Morgan regularly accusing Mr Johnson of intentionally snubbing the show, notoriously tough on politicians. Well, three years after Mr Johnson famously ran away from Susanna and Piers by hiding in a fridge in the lead up to the 2019 general election, he will be interviewed by Susanna at Downing Street. Kate Garraway, who was presenting Monday’s programme with Richard Madeley, confirmed the news. ‘We’re actually going to be hearing from him, for once, tomorrow,’ Kate teased. A Good Morning Britain spokesperson confirmed: ‘In an interview with Susanna Reid at 10 Downing Street, the Prime Minister will come face to face with the presenter for his long-anticipated appearance on GMB.’  Susanna recently left her co-host Ed Balls stunned with the news Mr Johnson hadn’t graced Good Morning Britain with his presence for five years, fridge-gate aside. Even through a pandemic, party-gate and a general election, there’s been no sign of the PM. ‘We’d love to interview the Prime Minister on this programme, of course,’ Susanna said. ‘It’s not just been a number of days since Boris Johnson has been on Good Morning Britain but a number of years.’ Shocked, Balls gasped: ‘Years? Has he really not been on that long.’ At the time it had been 1655 days. Well, the wait is finally over. And there is plenty to discuss… Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV. Got a story?
