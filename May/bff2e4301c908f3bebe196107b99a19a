A 78-year-old pensioner has decided to return to working 40 hours a week to keep up with the cost of living crisis. Maurice Taylor, from Peterborough in Cambridgeshire, retired from a career in sales and project management in 2012. But, like many other people in the UK, Maurice became worried about his expenses going up amid energy supply problems and skyrocketing inflation. So he decided to apply for a job to ‘future-proof his existence’, he told the BBC. He ended up securing a role as a customer service advisor at a call centre for Addison Lee – a private hire cab and courier company. Maurice joked: ‘One of the upsides is during the winter I’ll be kept warm by their heating bill and not mine.’ Addison Lee’s head of customer support Sanj Gherra said it was a ‘no brainer’ to hire Maurice because he has ‘extensive experience’. ‘It is all about inclusiveness and diversity,’ Sanj said. Maurice was impressed the company did not ask him about his age at any stage of the hiring process. The pensioner said he was also looking forward to meeting colleagues and socialising with new people again. He encouraged any other retirees who are worried about money to consider finding a job as well. ‘If I can do it, anybody can,’ Maurice said. It comes after Rishi Sunak announced fresh financial help for British families last week. Every household will get £400 off their bills, pensioners will receive a one-off payment of £300 to go towards energy costs and people on different types of benefits will get extra help too.
