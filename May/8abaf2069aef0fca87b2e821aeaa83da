The Metropolitan Police’s partygate investigation has concluded with more than 120 fines – making Downing Street and Whitehall the most fined location in the UK. A total of 126 fines were issued by Scotland Yard, with some people receiving more than one fixed penalty notice (FPN). Boris Johnson received one fine over his infamous ‘ambushed by cake’ birthday bash, along with his wife Carrie and Chancellor Rishi Sunak. The Prime Minister has been told he faces ‘no further action’ and will not be handed a second fine for other rule-breaking parties. All eyes will now be on Sue Gray, whose investigation into Partygate has been severely delayed by Scotland Yard launching its own criminal probe. The top civil servant gave more than 300 photographs of potential rule-breaking to detectives. These, along with 500 pages of documents, could be published in full when her report comes out later this month. Police refused to confirm the identity of any of the people fined, but said 53 were men and 73 were women. Acting Deputy Commissioner Helen Ball said: ‘There is no doubt that the pandemic impacted all of us in so many ways and strong feelings and opinions have been expressed on this particular issue. ‘When Covid regulations were introduced, the Met was clear that whilst we would not routinely investigate breaches of regulations retrospectively, there may be occasions when it would be appropriate to do so. ‘The information that we received with regard to the alleged breaches in Downing Street and Whitehall was sufficient to reach our criteria to begin such an investigation. ‘Our investigation was thorough and impartial and was completed as quickly as we could, given the amount of information that needed to be reviewed and the importance of ensuring that we had strong evidence for each FPN referral. ‘This investigation is now complete.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
