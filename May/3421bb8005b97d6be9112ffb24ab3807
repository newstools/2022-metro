Tense footage shows the moment police in Australia rescued three dogs and two men stuck inside a van engulfed by floodwater. Queensland police rescued the group after their vehicle was swept off the road by gushing water at Morwincha – 56 miles south west of Brisbane. The officers had been responding to a fatal traffic crash yesterday afternoon and were suddenly called to another emergency nearby. There, they found a van wedged against a tree with water rapidly rising around it, after being washed off a bridge. One of the men was shown clinging to the passenger door, while another elderly man was stuck inside with the three dogs. Police risked their own lives wading more than 100 metres through the water and rescued the first man and a puppy. Officers then returned to the van and one of them carried the elderly man on his back to higher ground. Footage shows him saying: ‘We’re going to do this quick because because the water’s coming up. That’s it buddy, keep coming. That’s it, good work.’ Police were then shown coaxing the dogs, a kelpie and a Great Dane, out of the boot and carrying them away. One of the officers involved is currently caring for the dogs, Ghost, Molly and a yet to be named puppy, until conditions in the Scenic Rim area calm down. Heavy rainfall has prompted emergency evacuations in the Queensland region, with many residents hit with flooding for the second time in a few months. The state’s premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said: ‘This rain is causing a lot of inundation. ‘This rainfall is not like the previous event, this is actually a bit more sporadic and it’s not as heavy, but we are still seeing some cases of flooding.’ She said eight evacuation centres are set to open in the region, as water levels continue to rise and inundate roads and bridges.
