John Whaite has expressed his devastation following the news that Cinderella will close on the West End after a troubled 12-month run. The former Strictly Come Dancing star revealed he was due to join the cast as Prince Charming, however, the production will end next month, before he was set to make his debut. Responding to the announcement that Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical will close, John penned: ‘This is heartbreaking news for me because I was due to take the role of Prince Charming in July, but more so for the current cast, band and production who have battled through Covid to bring a brilliant new show to the stage. ‘My heart goes out to each and every one of them.’ He continued: ‘I was lucky enough to watch Cinderella in December 2021 and it was one of the most wonderful musicals I’ve seen in a long time. ‘I was so excited to join the cast, and it was a lifelong dream come true, but sadly it isn’t to be right now. Who knows what the future will hold – I won’t lose hope.’ Carrie Hope Fletcher, who stars as Cinderella in the production, also spoke out about the cancellation. ‘I don’t think I have the words,’ she wrote. ‘And if I did I would probably be advised not to say them. Sending love to all impacted by todays news and by how that news was delivered.’ Lloyd Webber announced Cinderella’s closure at the Gillian Lynne Theatre, Covent Garden, London, to cast and creatives on Sunday. The show is still set for Broadway next year, however, it’s been reported that ‘every aspect of production’ will be ‘revamped before it heads there’. Cinderella opened in July 2021 and suffered substantial losses following delays and a temporary halt in performances due to Covid. Got a story?
