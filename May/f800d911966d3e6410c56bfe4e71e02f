Erik ten Hag has already outlined the minimum expectation of the Manchester United squad he is set to inherit from Ralf Rangnick. The 52-year-old was confirmed as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s permanent successor last month and is set to begin the seismic rebuilding job required at Old Trafford. Ten Hag said his final farewells to Ajax earlier this week and flew to London for talks with United’s chiefs to iron out plans ahead of the summer transfer window and confirm the composition of a new-look backroom team. The new manager will watch from the stands on Sunday as United finish what has been a torrid season at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace. Whatever the outcome, United will finish the season with their lowest ever Premier League points tally and could yet be consigned to the Europa Conference League if results go against them. With the likes of Juan Mata, Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard and Nemanja Matic set to depart, Ten Hag will at least get an opportunity to replace players who have failed to make the grade this season. Regardless of whether he lands his top targets, however, Ten Hag insists breaking back into the top four represents a ‘prerequisite’ for a club of United’s stature. He said: ‘That’s a must. The goal is to make Manchester United Europe-proof again, like we did with Ajax, reaching the Champions League with Manchester United is a prerequisite.’  MORE : Xavi sends fresh message to Manchester United transfer target Frenkie de Jong MORE : ‘A great leader’ – Erik ten Hag names Manchester United transfer target Jurrien Timber a future captain For more stories like this, check our sport page.
