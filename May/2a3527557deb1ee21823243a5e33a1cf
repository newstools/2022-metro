Eleven newborn babies have died in a fire that ripped through a hospital’s neonatal wing in Senegal. President Macky Sall sent his condolences to the mothers as he confirmed the tragedy at a hospital in Tivaouane, a town near the capital Dakar. He tweeted: ‘I have just learned with pain and consternation the death of 11 newborn babies in the fire that occurred in the neonatology department of the Mame Abdou Aziz Sy Dabakh hospital in Tivaouane.’ ‘To their mothers and their families, I express my deepest sympathy,’ he added. No other details about the blaze were given by the president. Senegal’s health minister, Abdoulaye Diouf Sarr, told local media that ‘according to preliminary investigation’ a short circuit may have triggered the fire. Sarr, who is in Geneva for the World Health Assembly, said he would cut short the trip and return to Senegal immediately. Demba Diop Sy, the mayor of Tivaouane, one of Senegal’s holy cities and a transport hub, said police and fire service were still at the hospital, but did not provide further details.
