Arsenal have reached a full agreement to sign Sao Paulo winger Marquinhos, according to reports. The Gunners had agreed a £3 million deal with the Brazilian club earlier this week after the winger turned down multiple contract renewal offers. Marquinhos had initially signed a five-year contract with Sao Paulo in 2019 but FIFA ruled that it was only valid for three years under normal regulations for players signing their first professional deal. The 19-year-old was left out of Sao Paulo’s squad on Sunday as they sealed a 2-1 victory over Cuiaba. And according to Fabrizio Romano, Arsenal have now closed their £3m move for Marquinhos, with the winger signing a five-year contract with the Gunners which runs until 2027. It’s understood that Marquinhos is viewed as a developmental signing who will make a gradual progression to the first team. Marquinhos made his first-team debut against Flamengo last July and has gone on to score four goals and register three assists in 40 senior appearances for Sao Paulo. He has also played three times for Brazil’s Under-17s. When asked about Marquinhos’ departure last week, Sao Paulo head coach Rogerio Ceni said: ‘Marquinhos helps us especially when he enters the second half, he has helped more when he comes on, especially in the second half. ‘He is a good player in that three that we use in attack because he helps, recomposes, runs from deep.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
