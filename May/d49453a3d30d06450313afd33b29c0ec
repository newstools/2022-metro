The cost of living crisis gripping the UK could lead to ‘civil unrest’ if the Government isn’t careful. Money saving expert Martin Lewis has warned spiralling prices of everyday essentials could trigger food riots. As inflation hit a 40-year high of 9%, he said Brits are ‘desperate’ and ‘angry’ at the bleak outlook facing them. He warned a predicted rise in the energy price cap from £1971 to £2,600 this winter could be the last straw for people. Appearing on Robert Person’s ITV show last night, he said: ‘I worry about civil unrest. ‘So the government needs to get a handle on it, and they need to get a handle on it quickly. ‘They need to listen, and they need to stop people making choices of whether they feed themselves or feed their children. ‘And we are in that now. We used to have a relative poverty condition in this country and we are moving to absolute poverty, and we cannot allow that to happen.’ It comes as the new HM Inspector of Constabulary, Andy Cooke, said he fully expected an increase in poverty to lead to more offending. The former Merseyside Police chief said: ‘What they’ve got to bear in mind is what is the best thing for the community, and that individual, in the way they deal with those issue. ‘And I certainly fully support police officers using their discretion – and they need to use discretion more often.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
