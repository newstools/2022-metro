A Leeds United fan delighted with his team’s narrow survival in the top flight shattered his foot jumping into the Thames. Johnnie Matthews stripped to his boxers and launched into the river after his football team narrowly avoided relegation on the final day of the season. What the 36-year-old hadn’t realised is that the water he was barreling into was only three feet deep. The father-of-six had told friends ‘if we stay up, I’m in the Thames’ ahead of a crunch clash against Brentford after an afternoon round the pubs. He was good to his word – but the plumber is now facing a lengthy spell on the sick from work. Johnnie said: ‘They were quick to remind me afterwards, but if the shoe was on the other foot, the exact same thing would have happened. ‘I then found what I thought was the perfect spot, but I soon realised when I jumped in it was only three feet deep.’ He said he’s ‘stuffed’ because of the impact on his income and admitted his wife is ‘disappointed’ at having to pick up extra shifts. Johnnie had hopes to get out of his pledge but says he was ‘goaded’ into it and now faces surgery on his right foot. He added: ‘The pain was instant, and I knew straight away. As I hit the water, I came up and screamed “I’ve hit my feet” and that’s the point where he cuts the video. ‘I tried to stand up but I couldn’t, I just kept dropping to the floor again. So I ended up scurrying out on my hands and knees. ‘Before the game, we were drinking in bars along the river Thames, so we were there all day – and it was the easy option to be fair. ‘The football stadium’s right on the river Thames – and it’s just one of those things.’ Johnnie, of Farnborough, admits he can’t swim and regrets his post-match dip. A friend called 999 but he was told to make his own way to the hospital, eventually getting a taxi and train home before making it to A&E.
