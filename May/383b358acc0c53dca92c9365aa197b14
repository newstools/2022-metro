The Queen has turned up to the Chelsea Flower Show after recent bouts of ill health forced her to make a last-minute decision on her attendance. The 96-year-old toured the west London event in a specially adapted buggy, thought to be the first time she has done so for any official engagement in nearly a decade. She arrived shortly after 5.30pm and was shown around 10 gardens, including one containing a floral display celebrating her 70-year reign. Renowned florist Simon Lycett designed the bespoke display, with flowerpots arranged in a likeness of her silhouette. They were planted with Lily of the Valley, said to be one of Her Majesty’s favourite flowers which featured in her coronation bouquet. Mr Lycett previously said he would find it ‘utterly overwhelming and magical’ if the monarch visited his display in person. Earlier on Monday, he told the Telegraph: ‘It would be totally special, and a delicious cherry on top of what is already a rather gorgeous cake.’ A number of other installations matched the theme, including a canopy of flowers evoking the Scottish landscape near Balmoral. The Queen confessed during an audience in February to having severe mobility issues. She surprised onlookers at last week’s opening of the Elizabeth line with a surprise appearance, and attended two horse shows earliert his month, but missed the State Opening of Parliament. Serious doubts over her ability to attend the flower show persisted until the day of the show, with palace officials said to be postponing confirmation of her attendance until hours before. Speaking of the special buggy, a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said: ‘Adjustments have been made for the Queen’s comfort.’ Just 10 days remain until the start of the palace’s high-profile Platinum Jubilee celebrations.
