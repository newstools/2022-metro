Katie Price could face five years in prison after breaching a restraining order by sending ex-husband Kieran Hayler an abusive text about his fiancée. The former glamour model, 44, appeared in court on Wednesday where she pleaded guilty sending Hayler, 35, a text calling his fiancée Michelle Penticost a ‘gutter s**g’, adding: ‘Tell your c**ting w**re piece of s**t girlfriend not to start on me.’ Price previously denied breaching a restraining order banning her from contacting Penticost at a hearing in April at Crawley Magistrates Court. Judge Stephen Mooney at Lewes Crown Court yesterday warned Price she risks an immediate custodial sentence, with the offence carrying a maximum term of up to five years’ imprisonment. The judge informed her: ‘Clearly you have accepted responsibility for this offence and that you indirectly tried to communicate Ms Penticost despite her restraining order against you. ‘I must warn you Ms Price that you are at risk of going to prison.’ Price, who attended court with fiancé Carl Woods, 33, was bailed until sentencing on June 24. She had been arrested on January 21 on suspicion of breaking her restraining order when she accused Hayler and Penticost of having an affair behind her back while they were married. After returning from court, Price appeared to address the difficult day as she posed with one of her horses at her property, which was dubbed the ‘Mucky Mansion’ after falling into disrepair. She posed next to her horse as she told her followers: ‘Having my horses back at home is the best thing ever back to my safe place my passion.’ Price was given a five-year restraining order in June 2019, banning her from contacting Penticost directly or indirectly, following an argument in a school playground. Her lawyer added: ‘It is very telling in this case that there is a great deal of background information which will need to be placed before the court. ‘Much of it is in a therapist’s report and the court would need to be updated about her current situation and indeed the matters which have taken up so much of her time and other people’s time over quite a number of years. ‘You will notice she has been subject to conditions of a suspended sentence. Part of my function will be to seek to persuade the court that in this case, because of the mitigation available it will be unjust to activate that suspended sentence.’ Got a story?
