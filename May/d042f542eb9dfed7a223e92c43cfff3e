Mohamed Salah has warned he has a score to settle with Real Madrid in the Champions League final. Liverpool will meet Real Madrid at the Stade de France on 21 May after Los Blancos launched a stunning semi-final comeback to end Manchester City’s European dream. The two sides met in the 2018 Champions League final, a contest remembered for Gareth Bale’s stunning overhead kick with Real celebrating their 12th European crown after a 3-1 win. Liverpool suffered a devastating blow midway through the first-half that night with Salah forced off with a shoulder injury suffered in a challenge with Sergio Ramos. The Egypt international now has revenge on his mind, tweeting after Real’s incredible comeback on Wednesday night: ‘We have a score to settle.’ Liverpool booked their place in the final after a 5-2 aggregate win over Villarreal with Salah making it clear ahead of kick-off on Wednesday night who he wanted Real to join them. Asked if he has a preference, Salah told BT Sport: ‘Well yeah, I want to play Madrid. I have to be honest. City is a really tough team, we’ve played against them a few times this season. But if you ask me personally, I would prefer Madrid.’ Asked if that was to get a little bit of payback, Salah laughed and replied: ‘Because we lost in the final against them, so I want to play against them – hopefully we will win it!’ MORE : Real Madrid star Karim Benzema equals Cristiano Ronaldo’s Champions League record MORE : ‘Football is unpredictable’ – Pep Guardiola reacts to Man City’s stunning Champions League exit after Real Madrid comeback For more stories like this, check our sport page.
