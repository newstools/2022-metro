A secluded beach hut near an exclusive seaside town has hit the market for offers exceeding £85,000. The hut offers stunning views of Embleton Bay, in Northumberland, and estate agents say it boasts one of the best locations in the North East. Situated on the sands of Newton-by-the-Sea, it also has the ruins of 14th-century Dunstanburgh Castle as a backdrop. The hut, which includes a nearby parking spot and is within walking distance of a local pub, measures in at 9ft by 15ft. However, before you get too excited by the prospect, hopeful buyers should know that the property is being sold leasehold. The sand it sits on is owned by the National Trust, and there are 36 years of the original 50 years remaining on the lease. Indeed, the small fishing village is now owned almost entirely by the National Trust – and average house prices in the area are more than £500,000. It’s worth pointing out that parking is also severely restricted there too  – so that’s something to note as well. Alnwick-based estate agents John F White said: ‘It’s an ideal spot to get away from it all with the miles of sandy beaches. ‘You also have the beautiful village of Newton-by-the-Sea and popular pubs The Joiners Arms and The Ship Inn nearby.’ Do you have a story to share?
