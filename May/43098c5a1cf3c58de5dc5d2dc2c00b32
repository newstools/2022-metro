A luxurious yacht previously owned by the legendary David Bowie has gone on sale. The vessel, which has its own VIP stateroom and patio deck, was first acquired by him in 1977. It was then refurbished in 2020 and is now up for grabs for fans looking to own some of his estate. And how much will it set you back? An eye-watering £4.85million. Measuring at just over 39 metres, the motor yacht was formerly known as the Deneb Star but it is now called the El Caran. The boat is built from steel and aluminium and was created by the Italian shipyard Benetti. Custom-designed for Bowie, the Deneb Star has been fitted with some incredible luxury features including a glorious sundeck. The mahogany finished yacht can host 12 guests in six cabins, including a full-beam master suite on the main deck. Below, there is the VIP stateroom and three spectacular twin cabins. All have TV screens, DVD players and en-suite bathrooms with bathtubs. As Bowie had an eccentric style, these elements are visible in the interiors, including the surrealist painting that hangs by the dining table and the retro-style furniture in the cabins. The main deck, which can host 10 guests, has a bright and airy al fresco dining area, ideal for dinner parties. There are also plenty of additional socialising areas and a built-in shelter provided by a Bimini top. The upper deck offers further seating alongside panoramic views of the ocean. The yacht has twin 824hp MTU engines give it a range of 3,800 nautical miles and a top speed of 12 knots. It has been listed by Giulio Riggio at Fraser’s Palma office. Do you have a story to share?
