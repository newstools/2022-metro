Wondering how to get grime off your oven? Specific oven cleaning products don’t always do the trick, according to mums on a Mumsnet thread. The best thing to use instead is a dishwater tablet, as many commenters on the thread revealed. It can easily scrub off stubborn grease, as one mum shared: ‘I wet a dishwasher tablet and rub it on the glass door – it cleans all the grease off. ‘Wipe off the residue with a damp cloth, then dry. ‘Incidentally, if you get gunk on your iron, iron a dishwasher tablet to clean that too.’ Many readers had no idea of the trick and couldn’t believe how well it did the job. One person confirmed: ‘We tried it and it was amazing. ‘The stuff just came off. Also takes the gunk off the kitchen cupboards and tiles next to the hob. I’ve been wondering round the kitchen with a tab wondering what else it will clean.’ Another wrote: ‘I’m a fair age, well versed in various cleaning tips and tricks, how did I not know about this? Neither did my mum. ‘Is this actually really well known? And why hasn’t some bright manufacturing spark come up with an actual cleaning product like this?’ Sometimes it’s best to trust the wisdom of full-time mums who have been finding ways to make cleaning more efficient for years. This hack works because dishwasher tablets are designed to cut through tough grease on plates and crockery, so it makes sense they’d do the same on an oven surface. Tablets can remove baked-on food, which is what oven stains are. Powder tablets have an abrasive surface too which helps scour away stains without causing scratches. At a time when spring cleaning is dominating our weekends, this might just be the hack your oven needs. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
