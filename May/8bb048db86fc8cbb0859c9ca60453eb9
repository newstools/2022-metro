Unrest has been reported across Russia, amid speculation Vladimir Putin will introduce ‘mass army mobilisation’. Dramatic video shows a military enlistment office in the city of Nizhnevartovsk being struck with Molotov cocktails. The CCTV footage shows seven devices thrown towards the building before huge explosions erupt. The new video follows rumours that Putin may introduce enlistment to increase his numbers in the war against Ukraine. The Molotov cocktails were reportedly directed towards the enlistment office’s waiting room. In the clip, two protesters are seen running from the scene after the first explosion. Russian newspaper Izvestia reported: ‘Fire damaged the door, and was extinguished by an attendant with an extinguisher.’ Computers and ‘a database of conscripts’ were also destroyed in the attack, reports BOL news. There were no reported injuries. Meanwhile, Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov today has denied potential plans to announce a general mobilisation or declare all-out war. He described the claims as ‘nonsense.’ British defence secretary Ben Wallace had said such moves may come on May 9, when Russia marks its annual Victory Day with a vast military display on Red Square. The march commemorates the end of the Second World War in which tens of millions of Soviet citizens perished. The size of the procession will reportedly be cut by 35% due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Putin’s forces have lost around 20,000 fighters since the conflict began in February.
