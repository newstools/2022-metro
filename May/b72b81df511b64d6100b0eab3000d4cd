The US has successfully tested a hypersonic weapon that flew at five times the speed of sound. It comes just one month after Russia test-launched its Satan-2 hypersonic missile, which allies of Putin claim could wipe out Britain within four minutes. The US Air Force used an B-52 bomber plane to release the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon (ARRW) off the coast of southern California on Saturday. It said: ‘Following separation from the aircraft, the ARRW’s booster ignited and burned for expected duration, achieving hypersonic speeds five times greater than the speed of sound.’ Russia has already targeted Ukraine with hypersonic missiles, whose speed and maneuverability make them difficult to track or intercept. Putin said the weapon of mass destruction was not like ‘anything in the world’ and would make countries think twice about interfering with his bloody war on Ukraine. Aleksey Zhuravlyov, deputy chairman of the Kremlin’s defence committee, claimed Russia’s fearsome bomb could destroy Finland in 10 seconds after the Nordic country signalled its intent to join Nato. He also claimed it could crush the Baltic states ‘like peanuts’. One Russian state TV channel even simulated how the missile would destroy the British Isles, plunging us ‘into the sea’. The ramping up of threats from Moscow comes as senior Russian officials appear frustrated at Putin’s lack of military progress in Ukraine. In a huge blow to Putin, Finland and Sweden announced it would apply to join Nato, ending decades of military neutrality. But it now appears under threat after Turkey vowed to veto their applications. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the Scandinavian nations shouldn’t even bother sending diplomats to try and change his mind. The Nordic countries have drawn the president’s anger after welcoming Kurdish refugees with ties to pro-independence groups. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
