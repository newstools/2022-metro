Sophie Turner spent Memorial Day with her husband Joe Jonas and his DNCE bandmates as she embraced the American holiday. The Game of Thrones star, who’s expecting her second child with the Jonas Brothers singer, looked chilled as she scrolled on her phone flanked by the band. Rocking a preppy look, Sophie, 26, donned brown flared trousers which covered her growing baby bump, with a brown jumper. She wore her red hair in plaits, accessorising with some sunnies. Joe, 32, looked cool and casual as he hung out with his bandmates, drummer Jack Lawless, and guitarist JinJoo Lee, rocking jeans and a pink jacket as well as a baseball cap. DNCE formed in 2015 and are known for their hits like Cake By The Ocean. Sophie and Joe rarely speak out on their family life but appeared to confirm they’re expecting their second child when they walked the Met Gala red carpet, with the actress cradling her bump. Speaking to Elle UK, Turner said: ‘It’s what life is about for me – raising the next generation. The greatest thing in life is seeing my daughter go from strength to strength.’ She added: ‘We’re so excited to be expanding the family. It’s the best blessing ever.’ English actress Sophie tied the knot with US pop star Joe in May 2019 and they welcomed their first child, daughter Willa, in July 2020. Sophie said she feels ‘very protective’ of the life she and Joe have built. Speaking to the publication, she revealed that every time the pair of them walk a red carpet, they try and make sure it ‘makes sense for their careers’. Got a story?
