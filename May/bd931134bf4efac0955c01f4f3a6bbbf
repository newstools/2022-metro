Joe Rogan has been given an almighty mocking this week, after the podcaster realised during a taping of The Joe Rogan Experience an issue he believed to be true was in fact a spot of fake news. Ranting about a supposed push in Australia to ban locals from growing their own food, the host slowly saw his argument unravel before him when a producer was unable to verify the claim with a legit example of news coverage. Rogan had claimed he saw an article about someone wanting to pass the law on a recent episode of his podcast, saying: ‘I want to know what their justification was, but I’m pretty sure it had to do with agricultural contamination. You could justify it if you’re a real piece of s**t.’ He mocked, while also calling Australians ‘f**king creeps’ and claimed the government ‘got a good grip on people during the pandemic’: ‘We gonna stop these motherf**kers from growing their own food. Because that’s how you smoke out an anti-vaxxer, because you can’t go to a grocery story anymore, and you can’t grow your own food.’ However soon his producer Jamie Vernon noted ‘not a single thing comes up’ when searching for the proposed law, in the now-viral clip. He can be heard saying: ‘I know what to look for, but the closest thing I could find is something like this, but that’s not what you were saying.’ As Rogan tried in vain to find an example on his phone, the controversial podcaster – who was criticised by many for ‘giving a platform to Covid misinformation, with several singers boycotting the platform in protest earlier this year – conceded it may be ‘fake news’. ‘It’s got to be a real thing,’ Rogan said. ‘It seems too good to not be.’ He soon said: ‘Yup, I can’t find it either…Damn it, it better not be fake. It might be fake.’ His guest Bryan Sharpe replied: ‘But even if it’s fake, the fake is usually the warning.’ Punters on Twitter were in a tizz over the moment, and the seeming silver lining justification from Sharpe, with one musing: ‘So, @joerogan finds out that he bought another fake headline & gets his daily reminder that all the wealth in the world doesn’t make you smart (cough @elonmusk cough), but what does his genius guest say next? “The fake is usually the warning”🤦🏻‍♂️. Conservative brilliance, everyone.’    Underneath the widely-shared clip on the platform of the moment Rogan realised the story was fake, another wrote: ‘Does @joerogan even fake check anything he talks about? Would take a 5 minute google search to realise the story was BS. [sic]’ Still, many praised the podcaster for admitting the story was fake, with one chiming in: ‘Joe Rogan falls victim to a fake story… fact checks it and admits within TWO MINUTES he’s wrong. And stupid accounts like this say “Got Him!”’ Another insisted, as the critiques continued to roll in: ‘JRE is not and never claimed to be a reliable source of news. It is a platform for public discussion & the expression of free thought. No one is obligated to believe anything someone else says, due diligence is the responsibility of the individual, or the parent of an individual.’ It comes after Rogan recently vowed to quit his controversial podcast if he has to ‘walk on eggshells’ in the future. Rogan – who previously apologised for his use of the N-word in resurfaced videos – has been at the centre of the row with his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, accused of giving a platform to false statements about Covid and the vaccine. This led to several musicians speaking out in protest against Spotify, with Neil Young among those removing their entire catalogue of music from the platform. In March he was joined by guest Josh Barnett, with the MMA fighter explaining that he feared he would judged for ‘every little thing’ he said during their chat and, addressing his fears, the host said: ‘There’s more people pouring over it but it’s the same thing. I do it the same way. ‘If I become something different because it grew bigger, I will quit. ‘If it gets to a point that I can’t do it anymore, where I have to do it in some sort of weird way where I walk on eggshells and mind my p’s and q’s, f**k that!’ MORE : Breaking Bad star Dean Norris wishes Joe Rogan was on the receiving end of Will Smith’s Oscars smack MORE : Sorry guys, but Squid Game season 2 isn’t coming anytime soon Got a story?
