Jose Mourinho was reduced to tears after Roma beat Leicester City to reach the Europa Conference League final on Thursday evening. Tammy Abraham’s early goal at the Stadio Olimpico was enough to secure a 1-0 win for Roma, which gave them a 2-1 victory on aggregate. Roma will now play Dutch side Feyenoord in the final at the Air Albania Stadium on May 25. Mourinho, meanwhile, has become the first manager to reach the final of the Champions League, Europa League and Europa Conference League – and now has the chance to be the first coach to win all three competitions. And as the final whistle blew in Roma’s win over Leicester, Mourinho was unable to contain his emotions as he was in tears as he hugged his coaching staff during their celebrations. ‘I am so tired, I want to go home!’ Mourinho told Sky Sport Italia after the game. ‘It’s a victory of the family. Not just the one that was on the pitch and on the bench, but in the stadium. That is our greatest achievement, this empathy and sense of family we have created with the fans. ‘I think our performance was extraordinary, others might see it differently, but when your goalkeeper makes two saves over 120 minutes against a Premier League side with so much attacking quality, it means we’ve done something good. ‘The lads deserve this, we have three Serie A games left to end as well as possible. ‘We’ve had a fantastic trajectory to reach the final, we dropped points in Serie A to achieve that, but now we are in the final and we want to win.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
