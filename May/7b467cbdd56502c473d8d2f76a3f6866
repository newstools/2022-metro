A TikToker has built her dream desk out of Ikea furniture. And has revealed how you can, too. Home and lifestyle influencer and artist, Nicole, 32, shares DIY tips, tricks and tutorials on TikTok and Instagram. The mum of two explains how she created the perfect desk out of two Ikea shelving units and a worktop. ‘The idea behind the hack is that children always need storage and somewhere to get creative such as arts and crafts or to study,’ Nicole, from Essex, tells Metro.co.uk. ‘By creating this hack, it has allowed access to do all of that while looking stylish at the same time.’ The finished product runs across the whole wall and also doubles up as a handy storage unit. She simply took two Ikea TROFAST storage units and placed them opposite each other along a wall. Then, she bought an EKBACKEN kitchen worktop – also from the brand – and sawed it to the correct dimensions (44cm x 186cm). After, she placed the worktop on top of the second shelves and drilled it into place. Then, all she did was stock the shelves, add some decor and the desk was finished in pretty much the blink of an eye. All in all, the desk cost a total of £167 – which, for its size and capabilities, is a pretty great deal. Her video has garnered a whopping 4.5 million views on TikTok, and it’s safe to say that people love the hack. ‘It’s crazy what you can do with Ikea furniture and a great idea,’ one person said. Some people loved the idea so much that they decided to do it themselves. ‘Love this, went and bought it and did it for my son the next day!!!’ commented one user. ‘Thank you for the idea. We’ve done this and it looks amazing,’ said another. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
