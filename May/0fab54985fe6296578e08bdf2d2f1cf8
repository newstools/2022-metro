Two Burnley fans have been arrested after one was videoed making a Nazi salute towards Tottenham supporters during their Premier League game on Sunday. In footage filmed at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium which was then shared on social media, one Burnley fan clearly performed the gesture towards Spurs supporters while another man who was stood next to him in the away section pretended to sob. Stewards then stepped in to remove the two men from the stadium following complains from Tottenham supporters. The Metropolitan Police subsequently confirmed that two men had been arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence. A statement from Tottenham on Sunday read: ‘The club can confirm two visiting supporters have been identified and arrested following discriminatory gestures at today’s match. ‘We shall be supporting the police with their investigation.’ Burnley said in their statement: ‘We can confirm there have been arrests in the away end today following reports of discrimination. ‘This is now a police investigation and, collectively, we will work with Tottenham Hotspur, Met Police and Lancs Police on this matter.’ Met Police said: ‘During the Tottenham v Burnley match on Sunday, 15 May, officers were alerted to two men who had been ejected from the Burnley section of the stadium. ‘Both men were subsequently arrested by Met officers on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence. They have been taken into custody.’ Harry Kane’s goal in the closing moments of the first half was enough to secure a 1-0 victory for Spurs over Burnley. The result has put Antonio Conte’s side fourth in the Premier League, although they could be overtaken by Arsenal if they beat Newcastle United on Monday evening.
