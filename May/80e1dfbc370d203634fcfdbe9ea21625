Former Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat has opened up about all of the amazing news the show has recently revealed about the upcoming season, saying ‘it’s not quite news for me’. Last Sunday, ahead of the Bafta TV Awards, it was announced that Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa had been cast as the 14th Doctor, replacing Jodie Whittaker’s 13th Doctor after her iteration of the role regenerates. As if fans weren’t reeling enough, on Sunday this week it emerged that none other than the 10th Doctor David Tennant would be returning alongside Catherine Tate as companion Donna Noble… before Heartstopper’s Yasmin Finney was cast as a character curiously called Rose. While at Tuesday night’s Sky Up Next event in London for his new show The Time Traveler’s Wife starring Rose Leslie and Theo James, Metro.co.uk asked Steven for his thoughts on all of the spellbinding Doctor Who updates, having been the showrunner of the BBC series from 2010 to 2017. Steven, who originally replaced It’s A Sin creator Russell T Davies in the role, explained that he has been privy to many of Doctor Who’s most closely-guarded secrets for quite some time. ‘Well I’ve known about most of it for ages so it’s not quite news for me,’ he said, before adding that he believes ‘Ncuti’s going to be amazing’. Ncuti is set to play the lead role when Russell returns as showrunner, which coincides with the sci-fi classic’s 60th anniversary. ‘I’ve seen his audition tape, Russell sent it to me a while back. And I think he’s going to be a fantastic new Doctor,’ Steven remarked. The writer went on to sing the praises of Good Omens star David, who played the Time Lord when Russell was at the helm of the show the first time around. ‘Obviously David’s a fantastic Doctor. It’s all good, it’s all good,’ Steven added. Heartstopper fans were beside themselves when Yasmin was announced as a new Doctor Who cast member, amid the speculation over what it could mean that her character’s name is Rose. ‘Life on Doctor Who gets brighter and wilder, how can there be another Rose?’ Russell said in a statement. ‘You’ll find out in 2023, but it’s an absolute joy to welcome Yasmin to the Doctor Who set. We all fell in love with her in Heartstopper, one of those shows which changes the world – and now Yasmin can change the Whoniverse!’ Meanwhile, on the subject of David and Catherine’s return, the screenwriter teased: ‘THEY’RE BACK! The Doctor and Donna! But… how?! He wiped her memory! If she remembers, she’ll die! ‘But, but… is it a flashback? A dream sequence? A lie? A fantasy? A parallel universe?! Alt Doctor? The Land of Fiction?! You’ll find out in 2023 as Doctor Who hits its 60th – diamond! – anniversary! ♥️♥️➕🔷 @bbcdoctorwho.’ The suspense! Doctor Who will return to BBC One and BBC iPlayer this autumn. The Time Traveler’s Wife is available to watch on Sky and NOW. Got a story?
