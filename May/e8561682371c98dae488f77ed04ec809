Jammy Dodgers are an absolutely classic biscuit. Tasty biscuits with a splodge of sticky, strawberry jam sandwiched between and the signature heart-shaped hole – what’s not to love. Now, excited shoppers have shared their delight over a brand new flavour of one of the nation’s most beloved biscuits. B&M has announced the launch of a banana-flavoured Jammy Dodger biscuit range – swapping out the strawberry filling. The ‘ba-na’na’ biscuit is the latest addition to the range from Jammie Dodgers, released in celebration of the new Minions film, and the new biscuit will feature the brand’s familiar shortcake sandwiches, with a less familiar banana-flavoured jam splat. The home bargains retailer has a four-week exclusive of the new biscuit flavour – so you’ll have to be quick if you want to give it a try. The Jammie Dodgers are priced at 50p a pack, contain no artificial colours, flavours or sweeteners – and they are suitable for vegans. B&M shared the news of the new product on their Instagram page and people are somewhat divided. ‘Omg I need to go find these,’ wrote one excited shopper. However another said: ‘banana flavour, not sure how I feel about that.’ So – how do you feel about it? Would you try the new banana flavour, or is it biscuit blasphemy? Do you have a story to share?
