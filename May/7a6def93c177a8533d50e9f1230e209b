A town councillor has quit over accusations he is mysterious graffiti artist Banksy – saying the claims are undermining his ability to do his job. Councillor William Gannon, who served Pembroke Dock’s Bufferland Ward in Pembrokeshire, Wales, revealed how he was stepping down with immediate effect in a statement released on Facebook today. Cllr Gannon said a number of people are convinced he is the infamous street artist, whose identity has never been officially confirmed. Who is Banksy and where can you find their best street art? His statement said: ‘As you may be aware an allegation has been repeatedly made that I am not who I say I am, but I am the artist Banksy. ‘A number of people believe that this allegation is true. ‘This allegation is undermining my ability to do the work of councillor and council rep properly. ‘I do not want this allegation to undermine the reputation of Pembroke Dock Town Council.’ Cllr Gannon was allegedly subjected to a campaign of harassment, intimidation and stalking after people became convinced he was Banksy. Sharing Cllr Gannon’s statement on local Facebook group, Pembroke Dock & Pembroke Citizens Forum, Marcel Laval wrote: ‘I am sickened to have to inform the people of Pembroke Dock yet again, that due to the ongoing harassment and intimidation…one of your local councillors has decided to resign rather than bring any further disruption to the work of Pembroke Dock Town Council and to their family life. ‘Sadly in past weeks he has been stalked in his own home and subject to numerous personal attacks on four social media pages.’ Banksy mural ‘Seasons Greetings’ was removed from its home in Taibach, Port Talbot, Wales, and taken to a secure location in February this year after ‘fanatics’ tried to damage it.
