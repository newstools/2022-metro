Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says the injury sustained by Fabinho at Villa Park is a ‘big blow’ for his team. The Reds won 2-1 at Aston Villa on Tuesday night to put themselves back level on points with Manchester City at the top of the Premier League. However, Liverpool’s victory was overshadowed by a first-half injury to Fabinho who had to be replaced by Jordan Henderson. Following a coming together with Philippe Coutinho, Fabinho went down and appeared to be clutching his hamstring as he limped off the pitch. After the match, Klopp suggested he did not know the extent of the injury but admitted losing the Brazilian for the run-in could have ramifications for his side. He said on Sky Sports: ‘That’s a massive problem. That’s a big blow for us. I don’t know (how bad), hopefully not that bad, but I don’t know.’ Fabinho’s injury scare comes at a crucial time for Liverpool with their FA Cup final clash against Chelsea on Saturday. Meanwhile, league games against Southampton and Wolves are set to follow before the Champions League final against Real Madrid in Paris. After drawing to Tottenham at the weekend, Liverpool were eager to close the gap on City. And Klopp was pleased with his side’s response at Villa Park after the home side took an early lead through Douglas Luiz. He added: ‘Massive result. Massive performance. After all the games we played. After not a good start where Aston Villa did everything that hurt us. ‘The boys were outstanding. We had to dig deep. Really proud of the boys.’ MORE : Liverpool keep Premier League title hopes alive with narrow Aston Villa win MORE : Antonio Conte hits back at Jurgen Klopp’s criticism over Spurs’ performance against Liverpool For more stories like this, check our sport page.
