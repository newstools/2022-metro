Australian TV presenter Erin Jayne Plummer died by suicide aged 42, her friends and family have confirmed. The Studio 10 host died suddenly on Sunday, with her co-stars Sarah Harris and Angela Bishop announcing the news. Plummer’s heartbroken loved ones have since shared that the star took her own life following a long battle with her mental health and that she had not been herself. Close friend Tori Haschka told Mail Online: ‘I want to share her pain. She hated nothing more than being a burden. I wish she knew it was a weight we were happy to help carry. ‘I wish we had found her a way through.’ Studio 10’s Sarah and Angela addressed Plummer’s death on Monday’s show. ‘We’ve got some really sad news to share this morning,’ Sarah began. ‘Over the weekend, Studio 10 lost a bit of its sparkle with our friend and advertorial host Erin Jayne passing away suddenly. ‘For two decades, Erin Jayne’s been a friendly and familiar face on Australian telly and for a lot of that, she’s been brightening up our mornings with her bubbly personality and mega-watt smile.’ They went on to share a montage of some of Plummer’s best moments on the channel. Sarah continued: ‘Erin was just a gorgeous human inside and out, and if it wasn’t for TV, perhaps Erin may have had a sporting career. ‘She represented Australia in synchronised swimming and even surf life saving, and there’s no question that Erin Jayne was a high achiever, and certainly a gold-medal mum to her three young girls.’ She concluded: ‘We’ll miss your sunshine around the studio, Erin Jayne, and all of us here are sending lots of love and strength to her family. You’ll be very missed.’ Plummer is survived by her husband and three daughters. A fundraising page has been set up to help her family, which has so far raised over $25,000 (£19,934).
