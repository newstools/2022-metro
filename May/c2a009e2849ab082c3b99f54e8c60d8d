Manchester City are set to finalise their move for Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland this week, according to reports. The Premier League champions have made the Norway international one of their priority targets for the summer transfer window, with Pep Guardiola keen to recruit a new central striker ahead of next season. The Athletic report that City have already agreed personal terms with Haaland and the 21-year-old has made it clear he is willing to join Guardiola’s side. The report claims that City’s push to sign Haaland is ‘a done deal’ and an official announcement is expected this week. City will pay Haaland’s €75 million (£64.2m) release clause, while it has been reported that the striker will earn a salary in the region of £500,000 a week. Haaland has quickly established himself as one of Europe’s leading strikers since moving to Dortmund in December 2019, scoring 85 goals in 88 appearances for the Bundesliga club. Speaking on Sunday, Dortmund’s sporting director Sebastian Kehl said that he expected Haaland’s future to be clarified this week and that the move had been delayed due to the death of the striker’s agent Mino Raiola ‘I know what is in the contract, we are bound by the exit clause,’ Kehl told Sport1. ‘We have tried in the last few months to reach a decision on Erling’s future. But then came the death of Mino Raiola. ‘Unfortunately, the issue has dragged on a bit. But I think we will have clarity in the next week.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
