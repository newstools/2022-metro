One of the UK’s most wanted fugitives has been arrested – four years after a gruesome gangland murder in Manchester. Callum Halpin, 27, was held by officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA) in Portugal on Tuesday evening. He remains in custody ahead of extradition to the UK. Halpin had been placed on the NCA ‘Most Wanted’ list in connection with the death of dad-of-two Luke Graham in Manchester in June, 2018. The 31-year-old, known as ‘Tank’, was surrounded and shot in broad daylight as children played nearby. A second man was also shot during the horrific incident, but fled the scene. Wade Cox, 29, was jailed for life with a minimum of 36 years for the murder, which police said was a result of a drug-dealing turf war. Four others were also jailed. Detective inspector Lee Barrow, of Greater Manchester Police, said Halpin’s arrest reflects the ‘pursuit of justice’ for Mr Graham’s family. He said: ‘Halpin has been on the run since Luke was fatally shot on that tragic day nearly four years ago and it has been our intention ever since to ensure all those suspected of being responsible for his death are caught and prosecuted. ‘I want to thank partners from the NCA for their work in arresting Halpin. ‘I know this will send a strong message to fugitives – and also the public – that we are totally committed to working with law enforcement agencies across the world to ensure those wanted are caught wherever they try to hide, and ultimately face the serious charges they are accused of.’ Steve Reynolds, NCA regional manager in Spain, added: ‘Halpin’s arrest comes only 48 hours after another fugitive was arrested in Portugal. ‘These arrests should serve as a warning to other fugitives and most wanted subjects that we will not stop until they are captured.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
