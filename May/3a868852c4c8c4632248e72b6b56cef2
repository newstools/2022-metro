N-Dubz are officially reuniting for a tour and releasing a new single as their decade-long hiatus finally comes to an end. It’s time to practise our ‘na na naiiiii’ and dig out the Dappy hats from the back of the wardrobe as the trio are officially heading out on the road in November – the first time fans will be able to see them live in 11 years. Tulisa, Dappy and Fazer confirmed the news with a trailer video for their upcoming single Charmer on social media, showing a helicopter flying over London before the three of them step out of it. Charmer is set to drop on Thursday, May 19, with tickets for their 10-date UK tour going on sale the following day. The group had several hits between 2006 and 2012 and their first two albums, Uncle B and Against All Odds, were certified platinum in the UK, before going on what would be a 10-year break. A release for the band teases: ‘Charmer is instantly recognisable as an N-Dubz song, featuring their trademark storytelling via the slick raps of Dappy and Fazer, alongside the sassy vocals of Tulisa.’ Charmer will premiere on BBC 1 Xtra on Thursday evening and will be released immediately after its first play. Tickets go on general sale at 10am Friday May 20. Got a story?
