What would you do for £1 million? At some point, everyone’s mate has sat across from them with a pint and asked what boundaries could be pushed for money. And if you answered truthfully, you probably said yes to something a bit gross and to something else really embarrassing. Because what’s a moment’s pain for a lifetime of wealth? Well one man put did just this and put his ego on the line – for a fiver. Marek Racz filmed his friend trying to make it from one end of the canal in Walsall, in the West Midlands, to the other on Saturday. Footage shows the man giving himself a run-up to the edge of the canal and leaping into the air. Just as it looks like he might actually make it, the man plummets into the water at the last minute. People help him out and cheer him on while everyone around, including the man himself, are laughing loudly. Others have since praised the man on social media, with one local commenting: ‘ten for effort’. It seems to be part of a trend because Mr Racz’s Facebook page, Walsall Madness, shows several other videos of people attempting something similar. Footage from the day before shows a different man running straight into the water and swimming to the other side of the canal – where confused diners watch from a riverside restaurant. The clip is captioned: ‘What people gonna do for a tenner’. In a third video posted on Tuesday, a man can be seen hanging onto the edge of the canal while he floats shirtless in the water. The canal in Walsall is around 22 metres deep and three metres wide. The canal was almost lost forever, after it became too rundown, but a recent redevelopment saw it restored to encourage walking enthusiasts and cyclists.
