Human remains discovered in Shropshire are believed to have been in the River Severn for a ‘significant’ period, police say. Emergency services were alerted to the grisly find between Shrewsbury and Ironbridge by a member of the public at around 9.15pm on Saturday night. Police and the fire service helped recover the remains from the village of Cressage – and experts later confirmed that they were human.
