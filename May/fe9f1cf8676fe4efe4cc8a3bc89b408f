Frenkie de Jong has told Manchester United and Erik ten Hag that his preference is to stay at Barcelona. Ten Hag has made De Jong one of his top targets for the summer window as the new United manager looks to rebuild his midfield at Old Trafford ahead of next season. Barcelona are understood to be open to selling De Jong this summer in order to balance their finances but the Spanish club are demanding a £70 million fee for the 25-year-old. However, De Jong is adamant that he wants to remain at Camp Nou and insists he has not been told by the club that United have made a concrete approach. ‘I used to be reckless when I was asked about other clubs,that time has passed,’ De Jong told Dutch media on Tuesday. Asked if he had been approached, De Jong replied: ‘I can’t say anything about that but I prefer to stay at Barcelona. ‘I have already said it before, Barcelona are the club of my dreams since I was little. If other clubs call I will take the call, of course. It is something that is always done.’ De Jong, however, did acknowledge that he is aware of his links with a move to United. ‘Of course I get that, too,’ said the midfielder. ‘But I have not heard anything from the club’s management, so I assume that nothing is concrete, or that an agreement has already been reached. Then there’s no point in worrying about it.’ De Jong was also asked about a potential reunion with his former manager at Ajax. ‘That is a logical link, given my past with Erik ten Hag,’ said De Jong. ‘But that’s what it is… the link is logical, anyone can make it.’ Asked if he had spoken to Ten Hag about joining United, De Jong replied: ‘I can’t say anything more about that. I wouldn’t do that when it comes to other clubs or coaches.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
