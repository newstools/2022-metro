Those watching the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial this week got quite a surprise when they found out his real name. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor and Aquaman actress returned to a Virginia court on Tuesday where they are counter suing each other for libel. Depp, 58, sued his ex-wife for $50million (£40m), claiming that a 2018 article she wrote for The Washington Post about her experience with domestic abuse, suggested that he was physically and sexually abusive towards her during their marriage. Heard later filed a countersuit against him for $100m (£80.3m). Discussion about Depp’s full name mounted online as proceedings continued yesterday… Johnny was born in Kentucky as John Christopher Depp II so his stage moniker doesn’t deviate too far from his real name. The ‘second’ is because the actor was named after his father John Christopher Depp. Early on in her testimony, Heard was asked about a text message she received from Depp in August 2014, which was signed off: ‘Yours… Steve.’ The sender was also listed as ‘Steve’. There’s no big mystery about it as it was revealed that Heard would call Depp ‘Steve’ as a nickname and, in turn, he would call her ‘Slim’. It’s believed the nicknames are inspired by two characters from the 1944 movie To Have and Have Not, Steve and Slim, who were played by Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Coincidentally, the characters have a 25-year age gap, much like Depp and Heard with 22 years between them. The trial continues. Got a story?
