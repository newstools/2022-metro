A killer who stabbed a man to death near St Pauls Cathedral in London last night has still not been tracked down. Police found the man seriously hurt in the street at around 11.30pm, and he was taken to hospital but did not survive. The age and identity of the victim is as yet still unknown, and no arrests have been made. Paramedics tried to save the man by giving CPR and rushed him to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel. Police have now cordoned off the scene in Gresham Street, just in the shadow of the famous cathedral. Forensics teams are in the area investigating and several cars have been cordoned off, including a blue car outside the Lord Raglen pub and a grey Mercedes parked near to where the man was attacked. Assistant Commissioner Pete O’Doherty said: ‘City of London Police were called to reports of a stabbing in Gresham Street at 11.30pm on May 1. ‘Officers found a man suffering from serious injuries and carried out CPR at the scene before he was taken to the Royal London Hospital where he later sadly died. ‘Enquiries are ongoing and no arrests have been made at this time.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
