What better way to welcome in the Platinum Jubilee bank holiday than with some royal-themed food? Better yet, you can even snap it up at a discount. Burger King is selling chicken and vegan royales for £1.99 all week (until Sunday June 5) – to pay tribute to Her Majesty. It’s a hefty discount, too, considering the popular Burger King sandwich normally costs around £4.99. For those not clued-up, royales are made up of breaded chicken or a vegan fillet, along with lettuce and mayo in a sesame bun. Customers looking to snap up this bargain need to head to the Burger King app and download a voucher. Then take this to one of the selected Burger King restaurants to redeem the discounted royale. It’s worth pointing out that the offer isn’t valid in Burger King branches in motorway service stations, airports, train stations or holiday parks – something especially important to note if you’re heading off for half term. The fast food chain has even gone one step further and has designed some special cardboard crowns for the Platinum Jubilee, marking Queen Elizabeth II’ s 70 years on the throne. These have been designed by British artist Toby Triumph and feature 26 illustrations – with each one representing milestones from the monarch’s reign. Do you have a story to share?
