House-hunters will know that the property market is currently a dark and miserable place. Here’s a bright spot to revive your faith and get you back to browsing property porn. A five-bed cottage on the market for £595,000 comes with an unexpected bonus: a cat. No, this is not an especially creative freebie from an estate agent. Instead, this is a feline friend who doesn’t really fancy leaving the place they call home. The listing for the property, in Littlebeck, near Whitby, reads: ‘The property also could come with a cat as the residing one would like to stay if possible.’ Fair play to the kitty – it’s a place we wouldn’t give up too easily. The home is a Victorian Gothic-style cottage with five bedrooms and loads of quirky original features, including rosemary tiles and teak fascia boards. There’s a study, a kitchen, a dining room, and lounge on the ground floor, and outside is a large garden, complete with a pigsty and an area for chickens – so you can live your full cottagecore dreams. ‘The house is oozing with period charm and is incredibly individual,’ says the listing. ‘It is located close to a protected nature reserve so there is wildlife in abundance including bats to add to the atmospheric feel. ‘For any one in need of a new familiar the property also could come with a cat as the residing one would like to stay if possible. ‘Everything for a new fairytale lifestyle.’ Alas, we don’t have any photos of your new cat pal, but we’re sure they’re great. Any cat that just refuses to leave somewhere is brilliant in our books. Plus, as we all know, you don’t choose a cat – they choose you. So do make sure to be on your best behaviour at the viewing… and perhaps pack some treats in your pocket. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
