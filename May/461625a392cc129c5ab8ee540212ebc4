Jubilee merchandise is out in full force. Everywhere you turn there’s a new royal-themed product to check out. In fact, a mobility aid has even been jazzed up ahead of the occasion – by the team at Complete Care Shop. The rollator – which has been dubbed as a ‘Royallator’ for the event – is designed to help those with mobility problems get around a little easier. It’s ideal for anyone looking for a little extra support while walking during the upcoming celebrations, and it can be easily folded down when not in use. It comes with its own clip-on bag – great for storing Jubilee-themed snacks – and is available in a regal purple shade, complete with Union Jacks adorned on it. Combining style and manoeuvrability, the limited edition aid comes in at £129.98 – alternatively, if an individual wants to redecorate their own, the standard version is available for £99.98. Claire Clough, head of digital product sales at Compete Care Shop, says: ‘We know that many of our customers want to continue to lead an active and involved life, and celebrating important national events like the Platinum Jubilee is one way that we can feel connected to friends, family, neighbours and our wider community. ‘Having limited mobility doesn’t have to limit showing your personality and flair and we know that some of our clients will appreciate a jazzed-up-jubilee feel. ‘So, no matter how one is celebrating, our special edition “Royallator” is a fitting and fun way to feel supported.’ Do you have a story to share?
