Erik ten Hag says he’s looking forward to working with Harry Maguire next season,  describing the defender as a ‘great player’. The United skipper has come under huge criticism this season for his below-par performances and there has even been calls for him to be stripped of the captaincy. Ten Hag has his work cut out at Old Trafford, with the likes of Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Edinson Cavani, Juan Mata and Nemanja Matic all set to leave the club on free transfers before the Dutchman can even add to his squad. He already has his own ideas about where the squad must be strengthened, with a centre-back, a right-back, a central midfielder and a forward all priorities. But Ten Hag has confirmed that Maguire is part of his plans despite his displays this term. Asked whether Maguire will retain the captaincy, Ten Hag said: ‘I have to repeat: next season is a different season but I think he did a great job, he is a great player.‘He has achieved a lot, also the contribution to Man United, so I’m looking forward to working with him.’ Former United manager Louis van Gaal advised Ten Hag not to take the job at Old Trafford by describing the Reds as a ‘commercial club. Ten Hag, though, says it’s not a ‘risk’ for him to move to the Theatre of Dreams and he’s confident he can be successful at the club. ‘Coming [to] Manchester United is not a risk for me,’ said Ten Hag.‘This club has a great history, let’s make a great future. I’m 100% committed. I’m sure we can do that.’ MORE : Antonio Conte wants Tottenham to sign Arsenal transfer target Gabriel Jesus For more stories like this, check our sport page.
