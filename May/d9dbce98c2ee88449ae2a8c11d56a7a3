Greene King pubs have been forced to tweak their plan to sell pints for 6p, but don’t worry, you’re still in for a great deal. The chain of pubs originally planned to sell customers one pint each for just 6p today, 30 May, to mark the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee. Why 6p? Because that’s what pints used to cost in 1952, when the Queen ascended to the throne. All you need to do is say the password ‘1952’ at the bar. However, a Greene King spokesperson has now said they’re technically not allowed to charge that price according to licensing laws. They said: ‘One of the ideas we had was for a promotion in 400 of our managed pubs where customers could buy one pint each of Greene King IPA for 6p today – the same price it was in 1952. ‘We thought this was a great way to celebrate this remarkable occasion, and we’ve been thrilled at the response from customers. ‘However, we have some good news for everyone, which is that we will now be giving the Jubilee first pint of Greene King IPA away free of charge today, as we now understand it’s not permissible under the licensing act to charge the 6p. ‘Just remember to use the keyword “1952” and check whether your local pub is running the offer plus further details at greeneking-pubs.co.uk/my-local. Cheers everyone.’ Customers can get a pint of Greene King IPA at one of the company’s 408 Local Pubs or Flaming Grill venues. Do you have a story to share?
