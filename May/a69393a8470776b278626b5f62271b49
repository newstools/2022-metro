A woman has added some very cute and cat-friendly decor to the cupboard under her stairs, so her feline friends can have a place to chill. Peggy White, 35, from Oklahoma, US, even added a cat flap, so her dogs can’t get in. The business owner has put up shelves for her cats Guliver, 15, and Frankie, four, as well as a swinging bed and a faux branch. Peggy said: ‘It’s a calm and relaxing place for the cats to eat their food. ‘Initially, I transformed the cupboard for my cat called Herman who was diagnosed with kidney failure aged eight. ‘I wanted to make somewhere special for him before he passed away. ‘Now, it is used by Guliver, 15, and Frankie, four, who is a rescue cat.’ The cat’s room has multiple comfy beds for them and a floral accent wall. The project cost £160 [$200], and took Peggy two weeks. She also added stairs and a platform with a disco ball along with plenty of toys. She adds: ‘A lot of people are shocked when they see what I have done with the space. ‘Many people have asked if they could move in as they love the decor so much. ‘Whilst some people have accused me of locking them in the closet as they didn’t realise there is a cat flap at the bottom.’ Frankie, the rescued cat, has sadly been fat-shamed by trolls online after his owner shared handiwork online. Peggy said: ‘Most of the feedback online has been positive but some people have commented saying Frankie is overweight. ‘But he used to be feral, so he does eat every meal like it is his last. ‘My cat has a good life and is happy, so the negative comments don’t bother me.’ Do you have a story to share?
