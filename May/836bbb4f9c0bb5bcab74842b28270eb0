Eating a balanced diet is absolutely vital for your health and wellbeing. Not doing so can cause a wealth of problems for people, including, it seems, turning your skin orange, as one woman found out. Alysha Shobe, of Cincinnati, Ohio, ate sweet potatoes for or with every meal for six months in a bid to lose weight. She completely cut out processed foods and went on a strict sweet potato and vegetable diet after a break-up. The 34-year-old sales assistant said: ‘It started in the fall of 2019 when I was mad at a boy who I really liked. ‘I was determined to lose weight, which led to me eating lots of sweet potatoes. ‘I’ve always liked them, they’re very filling and satisfy my sweet tooth. ‘I became obsessed, I would only eat them and pumpkin purée. ‘I noticed a slight skin change but at first I looked tanned rather than orange. ‘After four months people started to see my skin turn orange. ‘I was a teacher at the time and even had a child ask me if my liver was okay. ‘The skin didn’t bother me, but my mom was mad, she would always yell at me for turning orange.’ At first, Alysha’s diet consisted of five sweet potatoes per day before she added other veggies like pumpkin, peas and butternut squash. Alysha did find that she lost weight, but thankfully she eventually came off the strict regime and started eating a more balanced diet. These days, even though she still eats sweet potatoes, her skin is less orange. She said: ‘I still eat them now, they’re cheap and taste nice. I just don’t eat as many, and I’m not as obsessed with calories.’ Do you have a story to share?
