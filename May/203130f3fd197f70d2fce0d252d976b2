The TV Baftas wouldn’t be complete without a word from one of the country’s most iconic broadcasters – and Alan Partridge did not disappoint. The character, played by Steve Coogan, gave us a hilarious monologue in a video for the ceremony, taking aim at Piers Morgan amid his move to TalkTV and plummeting ratings. Alan apologised for not being at the ceremony, saying he’s currently on a tour, where each night he performs ‘to an audience bigger than Piers Morgan gets on the actual telly.’ ‘But the good thing about Piers is it doesn’t bother him,’ he added. Absolutely brutal. Piers drew in fewer viewers than both Sky News and BBC News in his TalkTV slot on Wednesday night. He had a fairly strong start during last Monday’s launch, with a peak of nearly 400,000 viewers, but the follow day that number almost halved. However, despite his fall in viewership, he’s reminded social media followers he’s been beating Sky and BBC News at the same time slots. But both channels managed higher ratings than the former Good Morning Britain host’s show on Wednesday night. Steve previously revealed that his iconic character Alan was partly based on Piers, alongside Richard Madeley. Of course, many years have passed since Partridge first arrived on-screen, but when asked by BBC Breakfast’s Naga Munchetty who the character resembles nowadays, Coogan didn’t disappoint. ‘I suppose if you infuse Richard Madeley with Piers Morgan, you might get close to who Partridge is at the moment,’ he said. He added: ‘I think Alan likes to think of himself as cutting edge and edgy and relevant.’ MORE : Bafta Awards 2022: Richard Ayoade takes aim at Will Smith’s Oscars slap with brutal monologue MORE : Bafta TV Awards 2022: Coronation Street wins in coveted soap category
