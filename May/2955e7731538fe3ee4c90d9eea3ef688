Albert Sambi Lokonga’s brother, Paul-Jose M’Poku, is adamant that the midfielder wants to stay at Arsenal this summer and says a move is ‘out of the question’. The 22-year-old joined the Gunners in a £17.2 million deal from Anderlecht last summer after making a huge impact in the Belgian top flight. However, Lokonga has struggled to secure a regular role under Mikel Arteta this season, starting just 12 games in the Premier League. But M’Poku insists he is calm over his brother’s future at Arsenal and says the midfielder is ‘positive’ about the progress he has made in his debut season. ‘We’re not worried,’ M’Poku told RTBF. ‘Other players like Kevin De Bruyne or Romelu Lukaku have also taken time to establish themselves in the English Premier League. The difference with the Belgian league is big, and Arsenal is not a mid-table club. ‘We would have signed with both hands for a first season with 33 per cent of playing time. And Albert is improving every day, especially in training. ‘But the competition is tough in the team, with boys like Thomas Partey, Granit Xhaka or Mohamed Elneny, and the coach must respect a certain hierarchy. ‘He has so much talent; sometimes it seems so easy for him that maybe the coach expects more from him? He shouldn’t rest on his abilities. And maybe he needs to show more in training. I’m not worried, and neither is he. ‘It’s [leaving Arsenal] out of the question, at least for him. He is very well integrated into the club and the city, he is happy, although he hopes to play more next season, and his potential would deserve it. ‘And there will be European games. I talked to him on the phone on Monday; he was disappointed because, with the defeat in Newcastle, the Champions League has moved away, but there will be the Europa League, and he is positive about his season.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
