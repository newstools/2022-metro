A mass brawl erupted in the centre of Glasgow after Rangers’ heartbreaking Europa League loss to Frankfurt on penalties. Footage shows the large crowd of football fans, some wearing Rangers shirts, pulling and punching one another on Jamaica Street just before midnight. As one woman is pushed to the floor, some of the yobs begin to kick and slap her face. She tries to throw punches at her attackers and nearly manages to get up, before she is pulled down and dragged across the road by her hair. Some of the fans are then pulled apart as one man is nearly hit by a car. It is still unclear if there were any German fans in the fight or why it erupted, but Glasgow was not the only place where football fans showed their ugly side last night. Thousands of Rangers supporters turned up for ‘the biggest game of their lives’ in Seville, where there were street clashes before the game had even begun. A video shared on Twitter shows the disturbing aftermath of a brawl outside a pub ahead of kick-off. As the camera pans across, broken glasses and bottles, along with damaged tables and umbrellas, can be seen scattered on the pavement. Other clips show hundreds of men, some with their tops off and faces covered by balaclavas, hurling chairs at each other from across a street. The violence comes after Spain’s chief of police warned of the potential for ‘serious problems’ in the southern city due to the number of people travelling in for the game. Most did not have a ticket for the match at the 42,000-seat Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium and watched the final from cafes and bars.
