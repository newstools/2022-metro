Dozens of people were evacuated from their homes after a suspicious package was discovered in a residential street. A large police cordon was enforced on a Hull estate while the object was investigated by explosives experts. Officers warned people in the area to stay 400 metres away from where are it was found. People in the area said they had been told it appears to be a ‘homemade bomb’. Two bomb disposal crews from the Royal Logistic Corps army unit were seen arriving at the scene. After hours of investigations, the object was deemed not to be a threat. Residents claimed they had been told a ‘jerry can’ with a cable running from it had been discovered, the Hull Live reported. One witness told the paper ‘whether it’s real or not, it’s disgusting’, adding: ‘Whoever’s done it, whether it’s some sick joke or not, it’s horrible for everybody. ‘If it is real that’s really worrying – I’ve got kids. I want to know who’s done it.’ Chief inspector James Glansfield of Humberside Police said: ‘We understand on a day like day today when the weather has been warm how frustrating for our residents it will have been to have the cordon in place and having to leave their homes. ‘The item discovered was a cause for concern and had to be examined by specialists to ensure it was appropriately handled and dealt with so not to cause any risk or threat to the public. ‘I want to thank all of our residents and those in the local area for their patience whilst the incident was dealt with, as we have to take all necessary precautions to ensure the safety of our communities and we do appreciate your assistance and understanding.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
