An intruder dressed as a priest is believed to have spent the night at barracks with Royal Guardsmen close to Windsor Castle. Soldiers were approached at the gate by the man who was pretending to be someone called ‘Father Cruise’. He allegedly spent the night eating and drinking with senior officers before being offered a bed for the night, despite showing no identification or credentials. ‘This is just an extraordinary breach of security,’ a source told Talk TV’s The News Desk. ‘The guy turned up at the gate in the evening and said his name was Father Cruise and claimed to be a friend of the battalion’s Padre Rev Matt Coles. ‘He was invited in and offered something to eat in the Officer’s Mess. ‘Within a couple of hours, he was drinking with the officers in the bar and telling them stories of how he had served in Iraq. ‘He was telling lots of tall stories and the lads were enjoying his banter and having a few drinks.’ Police were alerted to reports of an intruder at Victoria Barracks at 9.20am on Wednesday while the Queen was at Sandringham for Easter.
