Passengers hoping for a relaxing holiday in the Caribbean were left terrified after the world’s longest cruise ship crashed into a pier in Jamaica. The 1,188ft Royal Caribbean’s The Harmony of the Seas cruise ship was meant to dock at Falmouth, Jamaica but instead people could be heard screaming as it drifted towards the pier and then crashed. During the video footage, one woman could be heard crying out ‘oh my God’. Another passenger was heard yelling ‘Holy s**t’. Despite the terrifying screams and noises coming from the cruise ship, no passengers on board were injured. The cruise liner crashed at 7am last Thursday. An investigation is now underway after several parts of the port infrastructure were damaged in the collision, including the pier structure which was crushed by the 227,000 tonne vessel. Royal Caribbean also added the vessel sustained ‘cosmetic’ damage. But the 6,687-passenger vessel was able to continue its cruise beyond Jamaica without any issues. Edmund Bartlett, Jamaica’s tourism minister confirmed although Falmouth’s port would need some repairs, it will still remain operational. He said: ‘We are repairing the damaged areas at the port now. ‘The divers are there now recovering the broken elements and we should be back in full order for the ships which come next week.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
