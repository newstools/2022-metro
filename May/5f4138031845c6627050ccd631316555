We finally have a date for the return of Love Island and it is literally around the corner. The ITV2 dating show will come crashing back to screens on June 6, with another 10 singletons heading to the new villa to find their soul mate. Laura Whitmore will be returning as host with her comedian hubby Iain Stirling back commenting on all the drama. ITV2 confirmed the news on Twitter, posting: ‘Here’s your first hot date of the summer #LoveIsland is back Monday 6th June on @itv2 and @itvhub!’ And things will look slightly different this year as Love Island moves to a brand new villa which boasts a huge 20 meter swimming pool and the biggest fire pit yet. It was revealed earlier this year Love Island would be heading to a new space to ‘enhance the show’ after five years in the same spot. ‘We didn’t own [the last property]. We rented it and we are choosing a new house for this summer so that is all secrecy,’ ITV boss Kevin Lygo told PA Media at the time. While we’re yet to see the confirmed line-up, Ronan Keating was suspiciously coy when probed over rumours his daughter Missy has signed up. Even Iain didn’t know what to say when he was pushed over reports Michael Owen’s daughter was also heading to the villa. We are ready. Love Island returns to ITV2 on June 6. Got a story?
