At least four buses caught fire in London after reports of a huge explosion at a transport depot. Video showed an inferno engulfing a number of vehicles at the Metroline bus garage earlier today. Eyewitness Shaun Cunningham told the BBC that he had heard an ‘unbelievable noise that sounded like a jet’, adding that he saw a bus explode ‘into a ball of flames’. Reports suggest no injuries have been confirmed so far – amid suggestions that the incident could have been far worse. One worker at the site, who did not want to be named, suggested to Metro.co.uk that the fire was extremely close to fuel lines that could have caused further explosions. ‘The cause of the fire was from the charge pack (this charges the electric buses) blast and as a result six buses caught fire’, they claimed. ‘Where the buses were parked at the rear of the garage it was VERY close to the fuel lines where buses are refuelled each evening.’ Footage showed fire fighters battling flames and a huge plume of black smoke, with later pictures showing gutted buses. Hertfordshire Fire and Rescue tweeted: ‘We are currently in attendance at a large fire on Potter’s Bar High Street. ‘Please avoid the area if possible.’ Metro.co.uk has contacted the fire service for further comment. Social media users suggested that the smoke could be seen around 11 miles away in St Albans. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
