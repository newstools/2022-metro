Kevin Spacey has been charged with four counts of sexual assault against three men, the Crown Prosecution Service has said. The actor, 62, is due to appear in court. Spacey, who has denied all allegations against him, is being charged with sexual offences between 2005 and 2013 in London and Gloucestershire. Rosemary Ainslie, Head of the CPS Special Crime Division, said: ‘The CPS has authorised criminal charges against Kevin Spacey, 62, for four counts of sexual assault against three men. ‘He has also been charged with causing a person to engage in penetrative sexual activity without consent. The charges follow a review of the evidence gathered by the Metropolitan Police in its investigation. ‘The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against Mr Spacey are active and that he has the right to a fair trial.’ The CPS said it could not confirm or deny whether or not Spacey will need to be extradited to the UK. The Crown Prosecution Service revealed that one man claims he was sexually assaulted in 2005. Another claims he was sexually assaulted in 2008 and forced to engage in a sex act against his will. These alleged incidents took place in London. A third man claimed he was sexually assaulted in Gloucestershire in 2013. Spacey was most recently cast in the upcoming film Peter Five Eight, with the trailer being released at Cannes Film Festival last week. He is also due to star in the film The Man Who Drew God. Spacey is best known for films including American Beauty, The Usual Suspects, and Se7en, as well as his role as Frank Underwood in House Of Cards.
