An angry mum claimed her daughter’s school dinner ‘looked like someone had stepped in it’. Her daughter attends QE High in Carmarthen, reports WalesOnline. She said: ‘My daughter sent me a picture of her food in school. ‘It was a jacket potato with cheese but it looked like it had been thrown on the plate. ‘It’s been going on for weeks. She says the only edible thing is the paninis, but by the time her year goes for lunch there’s not much left. ‘She’s complained a few times before and I’ve now resorted to making her packed lunches every day.’ She claimed the school dinners, which are managed by Carmarthenshire Council, look ‘gooey and like they’re off’. ‘My daughter came back from school hungry last week because she said the food was vile, so she eats me out of house and home when she comes back,’ the mum added. The council said in response: ‘Now this has been brought to our attention we will be looking into this matter. ‘If any pupil feels that their food is substandard then please take it back to the counter.’ The boss of a leader wholesaler recently warned the portion size of school dinners may have to be slashed due to the soaring cost of food. Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfood, said schools might also have to use cheaper ingredients in a bid to counter rapidly rising prices. ‘The situation is going to lead to some difficult decisions for school caterers,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘Either they are going to serve smaller portions or use cheaper ingredients, which is not going to be good for children.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
