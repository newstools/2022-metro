A rapist sexually assaulted a woman four years after he was released from prison. After being jailed for six years for raping a woman in Hull in 2015, Phillip Weaver struck again on New Year’s Day this year. This time, the vile offender also beat his victim with a metal bar, injuring her face. In a victim impact statement, the woman said: ‘If he had hit me in the wrong place, I could have died. It is hard to wrap my head around that.’ Hull Crown Court heard the 32-year-old was released from prison in 2018. Back in 2015, he had targeted a woman on a popular cycle path running near the city centre. Weaver followed her, before pulling her off her bike and raping her. Judge Mark Bury described him as dangerous and aggressive and said he poses a ‘significant risk of harm’ to women. Detective Annabel Devall, from Humberside Police, praised the victim’s ‘courage’ and ‘bravery’ that she has shown throughout the investigation. ‘This dangerous offender caused the victim great physical and mental harm,’ she said. ‘I know nothing will take away the suffering that Weaver has caused the victim, but I hope the outcome at court will provide them with some closure in knowing that he is now behind bars and unable to attack anyone else.’ Nick Peacock, mitigating, told the court that the defendant initially pleaded not guilty, but ended up pleading guilty before the trial was meant to be held in June this year. Weaver, of Cottingham Road, Hull, admitted to sexual assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and the breach of his sexual offender notification requirements on Monday. He was jailed for five years and also handed an extended four-year licence, which will start after his release. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
