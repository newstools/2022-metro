Always wanted to live out your ultimate Disney fantasy? If so, a new property listing could be right up your street. A Cinderalla-esque chateau is currently on the market, located in Angoulême – a commune in south-west France. The stunning property boasts 10 bedrooms in total and comes with 16 acres of land, as well as a generous pool. With 11,000 square feet of living space in total, it’s made up of an entrance hall, two reception rooms, a study, formal dining room, small dining room, bar, kitchen, laundry/heating room, master suite (with a walk-in wardrobe and bathroom), TV room, three further bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room and games room. If that wasn’t enough, there’s even a separate two-bed guest house, a four-bed cottage, guardian house, studio and a garage – all on the grounds. And it’s a great location, too – just 30 miles east of Angouleme, on the Charente/Dordogne border. So what will this property fit for a princess set you back? Well, it’s currently on the market for £1.9million with Prestige Property. If that’s not your thing, elsewhere in the world of property there’s a four-bed house for sale in London for £750,000 – but it needs a lot of work. There’s also a stunning 1800s engine house on the market for £850,000. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
