John Lundstram says Aaron Ramsey has been left ‘heartbroken’ after his crucial penalty miss in Rangers’ Europa League final defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt. Wednesday’s final went to extra time and penalties after Rafael Borre’s goal wiped out Joe Aribo’s opener in Seville. During the tense shoot-out marked by some exceptional spot kicks, Ramsey, who came on as a substitute in the final minutes of extra time, stepped up but saw his effort saved by Kevin Trapp. Frankfurt’s goal scorer Borre stepped up again to score the winner and seal a 5-4 win. Speaking after the draining finale, Lundstram offered some supportive words to his teammate, telling BT Sport: ‘It is a lottery, anyone could have missed. ‘It could have been any of us on the pitch and unfortunately its him. But he is absolutely heartbroken.’ Former Arsenal star Ramsey joined Rangers on deadline day in January, arriving on loan from Juventus until the end of the season. The Wales international has managed just six starting appearances for the Gers, scoring twice. Former Scotland international Pat Nevin meanwhile praised the ‘astonishingly high’ level of the spot kicks in the tense shoot-out but believes Rangers will be ‘kicking themselves’ after the missed opportunity to lift the trophy. ‘Every time you lose a cup final is torture. After the work they put in, after the fact they got better as the game went on,’ he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ‘They really believed. The standard of penalties was astonishingly high except for Ramsey. He has to live with that for the rest of his life. ‘What an opportunity Rangers had. They’ll kick themselves. It was there to be won.’ MORE : Rangers lose Europa League final to Eintracht Frankfurt as Aaron Ramsey misses in penalty shootout MORE : Rangers legend Ally McCoist reveals his message to players and staff ahead of Europa League final For more stories like this, check our sport page.
