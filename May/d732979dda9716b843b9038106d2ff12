John Terry raised eyebrows ahead of kick-off during Sunday’s Old Firm derby at Parkhead after he was pictured in the directors’ box with a Celtic scarf draped over his shoulders. The former England captain is synonymous with Chelsea, having the spent the majority of his professional career skippering multiple trophy-winning teams at Stamford Bridge. Terry made almost 500 Premier League appearances for his boyhood club and, after a spell as assistant manager to Dean Smith at Aston Villa, has returned to west London where he is currently coaching the club’s youngsters. Despite his affinity with Chelsea, Terry also harbours affection for the Glasgow giants and was amongst the crowd hoping to witness Ange Postecoglou’s side take a giant step towards reclaiming the Scottish  League title. Terry’s appearance caused confusion on social media, but he went on record with his love of Celtic way back in 2006. Speaking after a friendly clash against the Hoops at Stamford Bridge in 2006, he explained: ‘I have always been a bit of a Celtic fan. ‘There was only one reason I took to them. Like my brother Paul, I followed Scottish football as well as English football when I was young. ‘He supported Rangers and I wanted some atmosphere in the house so I went for Celtic. ‘You start doing that as a kid and find yourself looking at their results ever after.’ MORE : ‘He can’t pass!’ – Former Italy star Antonio Cassano would boycott Barcelona games if they signed Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku MORE : Paul Merson believes Chelsea star ‘doesn’t love the club’ and expects angry fan reaction For more stories like this, check our sport page.
