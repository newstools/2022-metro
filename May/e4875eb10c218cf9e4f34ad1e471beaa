After first launching limited edition vulva dungarees in 2020, clothing brand Lucy & Yak is back with more period positive clothing. For a limited time only, shoppers will be able to get their hands on a pair of trousers adorned with period products and a pair of dungarees covered in a fruit print –  designed to represent vulvas. The trousers – designed in collaboration with Sam Dawood – are purposefully genderless, with the red and pink colour palette chosen in a bid to ‘challenge the stigma around bleeding’. Kelly Malka’s ‘Vulvarees’ design is intended to highlight how unique vulvas can be. Alongside the clothing launch, the company will also be making donations to organisations such as Hey Girls – a social enterprise that aims to eradicate UK period poverty. Lucy Greenwood, founder of Lucy & Yak said: ‘We’re so excited to launch our second Vulvaree edit, to continue to raise awareness of topics which can still be considered taboo, even in 2022. ‘I remember when I got my first period and how mortified I felt, it always turns up when you’re unprepared, I’m not even sure anyone had warned me it would happen, so you can imagine my surprise and panic. ‘I’m all for a world where no one has to feel ashamed or embarrassed about something as normal as bleeding.’ The new garments will drop on June 2. In terms of prices, the dungarees are set to cost £62 and the trousers will be going for £36. Do you have a story to share?
