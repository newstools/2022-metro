The Queen is set to personally own her first ever pub at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The gastro-style pub is a former social club which closed down two years ago. The Royal estate, which is privately owned by the Queen, plans to lease out the vacant Victorian building for conversion into a pub while retaining the freehold. If the plans go ahead, it will mean that the 96-year-old monarch will have her own watering hole less than a mile away from Sandringham House. Prince William and his family who have their country retreat just across the fields at Anmer will also be locals. Estate agents Landles describe it as a rare opportunity for the right operator to develop a new destination public house with restaurant and letting room potential. The 4,350 sq ft building was the home of the Sandringham Club which was opened by the Queen’s great grandfather King Edward VII in 1884 when he was Prince of Wales. The building is opposite St Peter and St Paul’s church in the village of West Newton where the Queen visits to worship once a year. Local residents are reportedly unsure what to make of the news, with some concerned that cars will clog up local roads and others looking forward to having a new pub on their doorstep. The former club is ‘full of character and occupying an elevated position’ with ‘tremendous panoramic views over the adjacent farmland and the wide blue skies of North West Norfolk’, according to Landles.
