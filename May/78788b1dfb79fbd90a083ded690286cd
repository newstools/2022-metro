A man has died in Sussex after being hit by a marked police vehicle late last night. The crash happened in Peacehaven, East Sussex, at just after 11.10pm. The 27-year-old died at the scene, despite the efforts of paramedics. An air ambulance was also reportedly in attendance but the exact circumstances of the crash are unclear. Sussex Police is referring the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), which will carry out an independent investigation because a police vehicle was involved. The force’s chief superintendent Jo Banks said: ‘This is a tragic incident and we are fully supporting the IOPC investigation.’ A section of the A259 South Coast Road was closed in both directions for an investigation, and has since reopened. The Dorothy Avenue junction with Bramber Avenue is still closed. Police are asking anyone with information or dashcam footage of the incident to contact them. Witnesses or people with information are asked to email collision.appeal@sussex.police.uk, quoting Operation Ambleside. You can also contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
