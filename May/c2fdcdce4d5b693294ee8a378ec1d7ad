The Queen will not attend this year’s summer garden parties, Buckingham Palace has confirmed. Officials decided they should not go ahead last year or in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. Her Majesty, 96, will be represented by other Royal Family members at this year’s parties. The three events at Buckingham Palace will be held on on May 11, 18 and 25. The monarch will also miss out on June 29th’s party at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. The Queen has been in fragile health since she spent an unscheduled night in hospital last October. Since then she has scaled back her diary on doctor’s orders and has been seen using a walking stick more often. Her Majesty has also been using a wheelchair, and has reportedly been cancelling some engagements because she doesn’t want to be seen with one in public. If she were to go to the parties, she would have to stand for more than an hour and move down lines to greet people, as per tradition. The Queen also caught Covid-19 in February and was said to be suffering mild cold-like symptoms’ at the time. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ‘Her Majesty The Queen will be represented by other Members of the Royal Family at this year’s Garden Parties, with details on attendance to be confirmed in due course.’ There will also be a ‘Not Forgotten Association Annual Garden Party’ next Thursday, which will be hosted by Princess Anne. She is a patron of the charity, which provides entertainment and leisure for the serving wounded, injured or sick members of the Armed Forces and veterans with disabilities.
