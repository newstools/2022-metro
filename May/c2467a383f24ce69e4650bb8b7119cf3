A mother has described how her 13-year-old daughter was accosted by a group of boys who assaulted her after she wouldn’t give them her Snapchat details. One of them pushed himself against her and touched her breast before pinning her down on the ground as another pulled down his trousers and pants in front of her face and exposed himself, her mum alleged. The mother, who has not been named to protect the girl’s identity, told My London: ‘They kept asking [for her Snapchat] and she kept refusing. ‘One guy got a bit nasty and pushed himself against her, touched her boob on top of her clothing. ‘He pushed her back and sat on her and pinned her down. Then one of his friends pulled his trousers down and his pants in front of her face.’ A friend who was with her daughter during the incident around 3.30pm on May 7 in Romford, Essex, ran to get security, and the police were called. The girl did not tell her mum what happened outside Premiere Cinema in the Mercury Shopping Centre until several weeks after out of fear she wouldn’t be allowed to go out with her friends anymore. Her mum said that since the incident her daughter has changed the way she dresses and she fears it has had a damaging psychological effect. The Metropolitan Police said: ‘We’re investigating an allegation of sexual assault by touching involving children, reported to have taken place in the Mercury Mall, Romford on the afternoon of May 7. ‘There has been no arrest. Enquiries continue.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
