Dwayne Johnson has shared his delight over being taken to prom as a carboard cut-out by one of his fans, sharing her photos on his Instagram and calling it ‘an honour’. Fan Mel had devised the ingenious plan to be escorted to prom by one of her favourite celebrities, sourcing a life-size cardboard version of the former WWE wrestler turned Hollywood superstar in a bowtie and bright pink tuxedo jacket. Mel coordinated nicely with her prom date in a purple glittery dress and shared a few traditional ‘date pics’ of the two of them, seemingly arm-in-arm, as well as a group shot with their friends from later in the night. Tagging him in the post last week, Mel thanked the Rock for taking her to prom and called him the ‘best date a person could ask for’. Now, the Jungle Cruise star has shared her photos on his social media, beginning the caption: ‘It was absolutely my honor @smilesweetsraccoon and you were the best prom date EVER!! 😊’ High praise indeed! Carrying on the scenario, he wrote: ‘Great to meet your family and friends too! 🥂😉’ The actor, whose daughter Simone announced her pro-wrestling name earlier this week ahead of her WWE debut, couldn’t contain his glee over Mel’s tribute either, as he added: ‘ps, I’m super happy you posted this! Have the best summer!’, before signing off with ‘❤️ dj’. Dwayne, 50, even paid close enough attention to detail to add on some of Mel’s original hashtags too, which included a reference to his rapping lyrics ‘It’s about drive, it’s about power’ from Tech N9ne’s viral track (thanks to his verse) Face Off. It’s not the first time that the Black Adam star has been invited to prom by a fan either. In 2018, he had had to turn down Katie Kelzenberg’s invitation via Twitter (for which she donned the star’s iconic bum-bag and polo-neck outfit, no less) as he was filming Jungle Cruise in Hawaii. However, classy Dwayne recorded a message for her to be played out as a surprise announcement at her high school, as well as sharing a message to her on Instagram. He also arranged rental of a local cinema for her and her friends to watch his new release at the time, Rampage. The man is a gem. Got a story?
