Manchester United bosses believe James Ward-Prowse could be a viable alternative to West Ham United ace Declan Rice this summer but they’ll have to pay up to £75million for the England international. Erik ten Hag is determined to sign a defensive midfielder after identifying the position as an area that requires urgent attention. United are keen on signing Rice but West Ham value him at around £150m and with three-and-a-half-years left on his deal at the London Stadium, the Hammers are in no rush to come to the negotiation table. The Red Devils have therefore widened their net and the Sun claim Ten Hag has been given the green light to move for Ward-Prowse after it was determined that he could play at the base of the midfield. The 27-year-old is well known for his expertise from set pieces but he’s become an all-action midfielder for the Saints, taking his game to the next level under Ralph Hasenhuttl. However, though United would save significant cash by moving on from Rice, Ward-Prowse is still priced at around £75m by Southampton. At 27, United must decide if that’s a price worth paying for the midfielder. Pep Guardiola has made no secret of his admiration for Ward-Prowse, describing him as the finest set piece taker in the world. The City boss would be open to signing Ward-Prowse, particularly as Fernandinho is set to depart at the end of the season.
