Love them or hate them, Crocs are having a moment. Once regarded as a major fashion faux pas, the shoe is continuing to grow in popularity and a new collaboration shows the trend isn’t going anywhere. London label Lazy Oaf has just unveiled a new collection of Crocs – with an intergalactic twist. So if you thought Crocs couldn’t possibly get any more wild – think again. The new limited edition collection features classic style Crocs as well as a brand new platform variety. Gemma Shiel, the founder of Lazy Oaf, said in a press release: ‘Crocs have been a staple in many a Lazy Oaf campaign, and we think they’re the ultimate shoe for anyone craving that “Lazy” lifestyle. ‘We had the freedom to play with possibilities, experiment and explore ideas, resulting in three bold styles that each reflect elements of Lazy Oaf’s signature style.’ In terms of the shoes themselves, there are three very different designs to choose from – all modelled by drag queen Juno Birch in the campaign. First up is the gooey bear shoe in a classic style with a neon green makeover. As the name suggests, it also has gummy gears adorned on the top. The next is the classic lined Croc in a lovely lilac shade, which has fleece inside and a giant, three-eyed fluffy teddy head on each foot. Then there’s the Mega Crush multi-coloured shoe – a chunky platform featuring enormous floral Jibbitz on the front and back. These shoes will range from £64 to £105 and will be available online at Crocs and Lazy Oaf, and in Lazy Oaf’s London stores from next week. Do you have a story to share?
