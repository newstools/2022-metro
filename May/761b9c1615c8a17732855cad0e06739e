A Russian state energy company will stop supplying power to Finland from tomorrow as tensions between the two countries grow. Electricity exported by Inter RAO will be suspended from tomorrow, as its Nordic subsidiary is ‘not able to make payments’. RAO Nordic said it is ‘not able to make payments for the imported electricity from Russia’. Finland’s grid company, Fingrid, said there is ‘no threat to the adequacy of electricity’ in the country. It said power from Russia accounted for some 10% of the nation’s total power consumption. ‘Missing imports can be replaced in the electricity market by importing more electricity from Sweden and partly also by domestic production,’ Fingrid added. But still, the news will add to tensions mounting over Finland’s decision to apply for NATO membership. The move has angered Russia, whose ambassador to the EU threatened a ‘military and technical response’ if the country joins the pro-Western military alliance. Earlier, the Kremlin said the nation’s bid to join NATO is ‘definitely’ a threat to Russia which would be met with ‘retaliatory steps’. If it did join, it said it would have to bolster its forces in the Baltic Sea, raising the possibility of deploying nuclear weapons in the area. Fingrid said Nord Pool, the pan-European power exchange, had not paid Inter RAO since May 6 for electricity it bought from the Russian utility. ‘Nord Pool is the one paying for them,’ said Fingrid’s senior-vice president for operations, Reima Paivinen. He added: ‘Fingrid is not a party in this electricity trade, we provide the transfer connection from Russia to Finland.’ A spokesperson for Nord Pool said the company did not comment on this sort of detail.
