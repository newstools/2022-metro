An urban explorer has provided us with a healthy dose of nostalgia, by uncovering an abandoned McDonald’s that’s been untouched since the 80s. The explorer – who goes by the name of TriangleOfMass (@trianglemass), has shared a video of the abandoned site, which has since gone viral. He was directed to the location by another explorer known as ADHD Urbex. In his video, the fast food venue can be seen in all its glory – with vintage drinks machines, old equipment and even the old-school pink and blue seating. The ‘time capsule’ McDonald’s has counters where the tills would have stood, with fridges and shelves still out the back. It also has an old drinks machine, as well as TV monitors and labels for French fries. There’s also a hot chocolate machine with the phrase ‘Always fresh, always here’ – alongside old paper and packaging bags. ‘Inside was insane just to think all that’s left there over the years collecting dust,’ TriangleOfMass told NeedToKnow.online. ‘To think people use to work there and eat there and the memories shared here at this McDonald’s once is just crazy to me.’ TriangleOfMass says he’s been fascinated by abandoned buildings since he was seven years old. His video of this spooky time capsule McDonald’s has since racked up more than 629,000 views and 116,000 likes. Do you have a story to share? Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.
