Liverpool and Real Madrid have both reached an agreement with Aurelien Tchouameni while the Monaco midfielder will decide his next move in the coming days, according to reports in France. Tchouameni is widely regarded as one of Ligue 1’s best young midfielders and has attracted interest from several clubs across Europe. According to RMC Sport, both Liverpool and Real Madrid have agreed personal terms with Tchouameni and the two clubs are now in negotiations with Monaco. The Ligue 1 club are holding out for an €80 million (£67.6m) fee for the 22-year-old, while Paris Saint-Germain are already out of the running. It’s understood that Tchouameni will make a decision over his next club by the end of the week. Tchouameni finished his campaign with Monaco on Saturday evening as the club finished third in Ligue 1, which means they will have to go through the Champions League play-offs. Speaking earlier this season, former Monaco head coach Niko Kovac claimed Tchouameni is already the best midfielder in FRance. ‘He’s a player who has made great progress,’ Kovac said. ‘He listens a lot to what is said to him and wants to learn and improve with each training session. ‘He’s a very humble person. He uses each video session to learn more every day, to find out what was good and what was not good. ‘Today he’s a France international but I think he needs to keep it as it is – simple. Everyone shines the spotlight on him but I think he has to keep it simple, so as not to get lost and do more than what is asked of him. ‘For me, he is already the best midfielder in Ligue 1 today.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
