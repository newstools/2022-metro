A man who ordered a Moonpig card featuring a photo of a woman lying naked on a bed has been convicted of revenge porn. Joshua Rees-Bradley, 26, drove more than 60 miles in a desperate bid to stop the card being delivered to a mutual friend’s home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. Rees-Bradley, from Rhayader in Powys, Mid Wales, said he was drunk when he ordered the ‘totally inappropriate’ card ‘as a prank’. The following day he made a frantic journey to try and intercept the card, taking it away unopened. But the victim saw the explicit design after logging into Rees-Bradley’s Moonpig account. Rees-Bradley called the police to own up to his crime and was arrested. He later admitted a single count of disclosing a private sexual photograph with intent to cause distress. The card was posted between August 28 and September 23 last year. Rees-Bradley was sentenced to 50 hours of unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order when he appeared at Llandrindod Wells Magistrates’ Court last week. In a victim impact statement, the woman told how she felt ‘betrayed’ by Rees-Bradley. ‘I could see the contents of the card and felt sick to my stomach. ‘I was embarrassed as I had to take screenshots of the images for the police. ‘I am still embarrassed to this day about the incident.’ Defending, Michael Davies told the court: ‘The card was not opened. ‘The mutual friend didn’t open it and he retrieved it from her house. ‘The victim only saw it when she logged into his Moonpig account. ‘Mr Rees-Bradley realised it was totally inappropriate. ‘He went to Kidderminster to retrieve the card; no-one saw it, apart from the defendant and the person at Moonpig who created the card. ‘He has shown considerable remorse – he even rang the police to tell them what he’d done.’ Rees-Bradley was also ordered to pay £85 costs and a £95 surcharge.
