An easyJet air hostess apparently told a customer  ‘don’t be surprised’ when his sandwich looked nothing like the picture on the menu. Alex, 38, has described his £5 Roasted Vegetable and Houmous Baguette as the ‘worst airline food’. The image on the airline’s advertisement draws passengers in, showing the sandwich stuffed with tasty veg. But it is a far cry from the tiny scatter of soggy courgette and red peppers Alex was given. He had paid £7 in total to upgrade to a meal deal while flying from Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris to London Gatwick on May 9. In a second blow, he says he didn’t get his bottle of water on the flight as it was ‘too close to landing time’. Speaking about the disappointing meal on social media, Alex said: ‘I was in disbelief at first. It is the sort of stuff you hear about with airline food. ‘I spoke to the crew and asked for another sandwich. The flight attendant told me “not to be surprised” and that pictures rarely reflect reality. They gave me another and it was pretty much as bad.’ Posting a video of the incident on social media, he added: ‘Is this the worst airline food and advertising you’ve ever seen? ‘We were given three minutes to eat before landing, and never got our water.’ One person online joked: ‘That is a war crime.’ A spokesperson for Easyjet has admitted it ‘appears that the item served falls short of the high standards we expect from our inflight food and drink range for our customers’. Saying the company was ‘looking into it’, they added: ‘We will be in touch with the customer to apologise for their experience and provide a gesture of goodwill.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
