Want to get away from it all? Well, this coastal property offers stunning views of the sea and has a unique history to boot. A cottage at Strathy Point in Sutherland that’s nestled within the main body of a lighthouse is for sale for offers over £140,000. Strathy Point is a rocky peninsula that projects three miles into the sea from Strathy village. The lighthouse, with its 14-metre-high tower, stands 45 metres above the sea. It was established in 1958 after campaigns for a permanent lighthouse lobbied that the seas in the area weren’t safe enough without one. It was therefore the last of the traditional ‘manned’ lighthouses built in Scotland, and became automated in 1997. It’s not got a typical design, shaped as it is like a hollow square with covered passageways that protect it from the winds. Accommodation was also built for keepers and their families, with the cottages being sold off individually to private buyers. Now, the three-bedroom North Cottage is being marked by Young, Robertson & Co. The listing says it’s ‘perched in a fantastic location, appreciating breathtaking views,’ and it has ‘a peaceful and private situation’ with sash and case windows, oil central heating and a large shared courtyard, protected by a fully enclosed surrounding wall that gives some shelter.
