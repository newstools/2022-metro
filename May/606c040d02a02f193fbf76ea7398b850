Masturbation is great, but thanks to sore wrists and difficulty delivering the same vibrations as your favourite bullet, getting manual can feel a bit lacklustre. What if, though, our hands had a bit of a redesign? What if rather than having evolved to do pointless things like writing or holding tools, they existed purely for the purposes of sexual pleasure? If you’ve ever pondered these big questions, rejoice, for Lovehoney is here to provide the answers. Their team of sexperts and graphic designers has come together to mock up what the human hand would be like if it were indeed designed for delivering mindblowing orgasms, for vaginas and penises. A hand designed to send vaginas into waves of pleasure would have all kinds of snazzy features, including a special thumb with little bunny ears for clitoral stimulation, hot and cold areas, and a ring finger that offers suction. For penis stimulation, the dream hand would have a wider curve-tipped thumb for anal play, ribbing on the fingers, and a longer and stronger forearm for better reach and endurance. Fun. Now, it’s probably worth noting that were our hands to be designed as above, it would make it quite difficult to do other things, like cooking, typing on your phone, and so on. So we doubt the answer is chivvying along evolution to these ends or getting surgery to turn your thumb into the ideal butt plug. Instead, perhaps we should appreciate our hands the way they are – and opt for sex toys when we’re keen to mix up sensations. Do you have a story to share?
