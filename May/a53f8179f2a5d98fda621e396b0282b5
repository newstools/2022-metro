An adorable three-year-old is delighting OAPs across the north of England, by dressing up as Her Majesty ahead of the Platinum Jubilee. Isla Bates has been visiting care homes dressed as Queen Elizabeth II – in the run-up to the celebration. The pint-sized ‘royal’ wears a pink coat and hat, a pearl necklace and matching shoes on her visits. If that wasn’t enough, she even has a grey wig to ensure the look is as authentic as possible. Plus, a little toy Corgi to accompany her. Some of her engagements involve planting trees at each of the care homes – as part of The Queen’s Green Canopy initiative – and showing off her regal wave to residents. Speaking about her ‘royal tour,’ Isla said: ‘I have loved being a mini Queen and helping to plant all of the trees. I like waving and making the residents smile.’ And it’s safe to say her visits have gone down a treat with everyone. Rowena Bolton, a home manager at Cheadle Manor, said: ‘The residents were thrilled to have a mini-Queen for the day and enjoyed the celebrations. ‘There were smiles all round.’ Isla’s mum Alex, from Wigan, says her daughter has loved getting involved with the Jubilee celebrations and visiting the elderly residents. She said: ‘Isla thoroughly enjoyed her time at Cheadle Manor and Bramhall Manor, and especially loved dressing up as The Queen. ‘It is a real privilege for Isla to be involved in the Platinum Jubilee and by planting the tree she is playing her part in improving the environment and leaving a lasting legacy in Stockport.’ Do you have a story to share?
