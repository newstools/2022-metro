Juventus sporting director Federico Cherubini has travelled to London for talks with Arsenal over a deal for Gabriel Magalhaes, according to reports in Italy. Juve are in the market to replace Giorgio Chiellini, who is leaving the club after 17 years this summer. According to Corriere dello Sport and Tuttosport, Juve have identified Gabriel as a possible successor to Chiellini and are keen to reach a quick agreement with Arsenal. However, it’s claimed that the Gunners are demanding at least €50 million (£42.4m) for the 24-year-old, who they signed from Lille in a £27m deal in 2020. Juventus are also holding talks with Arsenal to discuss the prospect of some players heading the other way to north London. Mikel Arteta’s side came close to signing Arthur Melo in the January transfer window and Juve remain open to letting the Brazilian midfielder leave this summer. ‘In January he was close to leaving and joining Arsenal,’ Arthur’s agent, Federico Pastorello, told La Repubblica last week. ‘He is too important a player to be marginalised, he must also think about his situation with the national team. ‘It’s not in anyone’s interest to continue in this situation.’ However, it’s claimed that Arsenal are also interested in Juve’s versatile midfielder Weston McKennie, while the Serie A club would also be open to a deal for Moise Kean, with the Gunners in the market for a new striker. Juve are also considering a move for Thomas Partey as they are keen to strengthen in central midfield ahead of next season, although Paul Pogba and Lazio’s Sergej Milinkovic-Savic are both higher on the club’s shortlist.
