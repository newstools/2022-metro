A picture of a perfectly carved out doorway has people thinking there might be little men on Mars after all. Recent pictures from Nasa’s Curiosity Mars rover show an intriguing feature which looks like a doorway nestled in the rocks on the Martian landscape. It looks so convincing that it can almost tempt you to believe that it leads to a Martian hideaway – or a gateway to another Universe entirely. While the internet seems to be having a field day with conspiracy theories about the mysterious doorway, some Reddit users aren’t buying it. Many party poopers have pointed out the door is likely just a shear fracture — the result of some kind of strain on the rock, breaking part of it off. It’s a likely theory given Mars recorded its largest earthquake this month, on May 4, although researchers are still trying to figure out what caused it. Nasa said the image was taken on May 7 at a geological feature known as Greenheugh Pediment, by the Mast Camera on board Curiosity. A mosaic view of the images place the ‘doorway’ into better context than the initial image. UFO news debunker UFO of Interest said: ‘Watching it in context as part of the whole mosaic, we can see that little niche in a rock with other blocks, fractures, shapes and other erosive features all over that rock face.’ Although the door-like rock formation appears big enough to fit people, in reality, it might be only a few centimetres or inches tall. One person wrote on Reddit: ‘So what if it’s only a few inches? how do we know what size our overlords will actually be?’ It’s not the first time people have assumed pictures from the Red Planet to be traces of alien life. Just last month, a Martian crater showing ‘alien footprints’ was clarified to be an important geographical landmark.
