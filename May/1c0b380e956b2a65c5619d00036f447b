Where would we be without TikTok beauty hacks? From saving time to achieving salon-worthy looks, we’ve discovered so many tricks and tips for our beauty routines. We’ve seen a lot of genius hacks for curling hair, in particular, including one involving a dressing gown tie. But now a brand new heatless hack is doing the rounds. The trick, shared by fashion design student Nicole Adalina, has gone viral on the platform – with some saying it’s ‘the best their hair has ever looked.’ Nicole gets this bouncy blowout style by putting her hair in a high ponytail and securing it with a soft scrunchie. She then divides the hair into four sections and rolls the end of the first one up to the base – using her fingers. After, she secures this in place using a bobby pin. The student does this on each of the four sections and leaves her hair overnight. In the morning, she takes her hair out, shakes and brushes it through. The result is beautiful professional-looking curls – with minimal time and effort. And the simple hack hasn’t gone unnoticed by beauty fans. One person replied to the video: ‘For the ones wondering… I did it and it turned sooooooo good.’ While another chipped in: ‘This is going to change my life.’ Someone else said: ‘Honestly the bun itself is a cute hairstyle.’ Do you have a story to share?
