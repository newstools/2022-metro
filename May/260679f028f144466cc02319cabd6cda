Ajax winger Antony has told Erik ten Hag that he will ‘stand with him’ if he makes the move to Manchester United this summer. Ten Hag has started work with United this week following Ajax’s final game of the season last Sunday and has begun preparations for their pre-season campaign. The Dutchman has also held talks with United’s hierarchy over potential transfer targets as the club look to recover from their worst-ever Premier League campaign. Several Ajax players have been linked with a move to United including Antony, Jurrien Timber and Lisandro Martinez. And Antony, who was one of Ten Hag’s standout performers at Ajax this season, has made it clear he would be willing to follow his former manager to Old Trafford. In a video message to Ten Hag following his Ajax departure, Antony said: ‘I want to wish you all the best at your new club. ‘I also want to thank you for everything you taught me. I am thankful all the opportunities and learning every day. ‘Know that I will always stand with you if you need me.’ Reports in Brazil have claimed that Liverpool are also in the running with United to sign Antony, with both clubs making approaches in recent weeks. Ten Hag has worked with the Brazil international for two seasons and the winger has been quick to make an impact following his arrival from Sao Paulo, with 22 goals and 20 assists in 79 appearances. Earlier this week, Ten Hag admitted that Ajax would struggle to replace Antony if he is sold this summer. ‘If Antony were to go, it would be a loss for Ajax,’ Ten Hag said. ‘You have no-one in the current squad who can take over his position. He is top class.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
