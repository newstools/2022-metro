NHS prescription charges are to be frozen in the latest move by ministers to ease the cost-of-living crisis. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the charges, which normally rise in line with inflation, will be held this year to ‘put money back in people’s pockets’ and save £17 million for patients in England. It means the charge for a single prescription will remain at £9.35, while a three-month prescription prepayment certificate (PPC) stays at £30.25. Twelve-month PPCs will remain at £108.10 and can be paid in instalments. Mr Javid said: ‘The rise in the cost of living has been unavoidable as we face global challenges and the repercussions of Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine. ‘Whilst we can’t completely prevent these rises, where we can help we absolutely will. ‘This is why I am freezing prescription charges to help ease some of these pressures and put money back in people’s pockets.’ The move comes after Boris Johnson instructed his Cabinet to come up with measures to ease the pressure on household budgets. Meanwhile, the PM also told ministers to draw up plans to shed 90,000 civil service jobs over the next three years, taking the workforce back down to where it was before the pandemic. But with the Bank of England forecasting that inflation this year will reach double digits, the Government is likely to remain under pressure to go further. After the Conservatives lost nearly 500 seats in the local council elections, some Tories have been calling for tax cuts as the only way to deliver real help to those who are struggling.
