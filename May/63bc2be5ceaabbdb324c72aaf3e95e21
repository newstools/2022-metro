Two men who got into a row at a pub took ‘revenge’ by chopping the head off a defenceless dog and hanging it on the victim’s door. Ashley Grundy, 31, and Steven Robinson, 39, have been jailed for the ‘barbaric’ act. Bailey’s severed head was found by a child after it was hung on the door handle of a house in Chorley, Lancashire. Preston Crown Court heard how Grundy and Robinson killed the dog after getting into an argument with another customer at the Baron’s Rest pub on May 19, 2018. Grundy threatened the victim, and in the early hours of the following morning the pair drove to their house and stole their pet. They first drove back to the pub, decapitated the dog and dumped its body in bushes wrapped in a car mat. They then went on to the victim’s mother’s house and hung the bloodied head on her door. CCTV trawl showed Robinson discarding an item which was later found to be Bailey’s decapitated body. Prosecutors described the incident as an act of revenge and intimidation which was ‘intended to cause maximum fear to the victims’. Grundy, of Kirkham and Steven Robinson, of Lancaster, were jailed for 19 months at for criminal damage and outraging public decency. Sgt Paul Harrison, of Lancashire Police said: ‘This was a lengthy investigation which involved a number of officers. ‘Officers sat through hours of CCTV and had to go through distressing incidents to compare the DNA from Bailley’s head and carcass to the DNA of the blood found in and on the vehicle that Grundy and Robinson were using. ‘I’d like to thank all the officers involved who worked tirelessly to bring this investigation to a conclusion. ‘I now hope that this can give some closure to the victim who lost a beloved pet due to the barbaric act of these two individuals.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
