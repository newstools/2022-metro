Dutch coach Fred Rutten has revealed he rejected Erik ten Hag’s offer to be part of the new coaching set-up at Manchester United. Ten Hag will make the move to United at the end of the season and is planning to bring Mitchell van der Gaag, his assistant at Ajax, with him to Old Trafford. But Rutten, who has managed PSV, Feyenoord FC Twente, Schalke and Anderlecht, has also held talks with Ten Hag about the prospect of helping out at United. However, the 59-year-old has opted to say in the Netherlands and has agreed to be part of Ruud van Nistelrooy’s backroom team at PSV. ‘I have a family, I have grandchildren. I want to see them every now and then,’ Rutten told ESPN. ‘At Manchester United you get on a train and you can’t get off it. I want to feel comfortable in something you step into. That is the case with PSV. ‘It’s nice when you have grandchildren, who you see every now and then and who can play ball with.’ Rutten, meanwhile, will link up with former United striker Van Nistelrooy, who will become PSV’s new manager this summer. ‘Of course I spoke extensively with Ruud van Nistelrooy,’ said Rutten. ‘He triggered me to give up the slightly freer life that I now have. He sat in the room with me and we talked for two hours about football and other things. And when talking about those other things in life, he also triggered me. ‘I think Ruud already has some experience, he has already trained a number of teams, at Jong PSV and their under-18s. ‘He has also acquired experience from the Dutch national team. Ruud is ready, that’s what it seems to me. I am positively critical. ‘For me, PSV stands for a Champions League club. Everything you do should serve that thought.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page. Follow Metro Sport for the latest news on
