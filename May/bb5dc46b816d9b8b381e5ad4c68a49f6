The Only Way Is Essex star Jess Wright has confirmed she’s welcomed a baby boy with her husband William Lee-Kemp. Taking to Instagram on Saturday morning, she shared an adorable snap giving her followers the first glimpse of her new arrival. The pic showed Jess and William holding hands with their baby boy, captioned with: ’We will hold your hand forever.’ She also revealed the date she gave birth – 17 May 2022. Her famous friends and fans were quick to comment on the wonderful news. Her mum Carol Wright said: ‘My heart is complete, can not tell you how proud I am of you both, it was wonderful to experience the journey love you my baby girl.’ ‘You did amazing, he is beyond beautiful. Happiest grandparents ever now to have two beautiful bubbas to love and cherish forever.’ Her younger sister Natalya Wright added: ‘Our precious boy. The most special week ever. Love you all so much.’ ‘So gorgeous 😍😍 congratulations Jess…. So so happy for you and your beautiful little family,’ commented Ore Oduba. Sam Faiers added: ‘Aww Jess a huge congratulations 💙 so happy for you all. Babies are just the most precious gift in the whole world ❤️ enjoy every single moment xxxxx.’ The happy news comes just under a year since she tied the knot with William in Majorca, in September 2021. The pair confirmed the gender of their unborn child back in January, a baby boy. Speaking to Hello! magazine, Jess said she had ‘always envisioned being a girl mum because I’m so girly so I was pretty shocked to hear it was a boy,’ but said she ‘couldn’t be happier’ with the news. Jess, 36, has been open about her pregnancy journey, after deciding to freeze her eggs after her mum and late nanny Pat both went into early menopause at the age of 41. She announced she was expecting back in November, with a gorgeous partially nude snap. She wrote: ‘Pregnancy – It certainly is a rollercoaster & that’s the best way to describe it! I’m scared, excited, grateful, vulnerable & quite frankly totally & utterly overwhelmed at not even knowing what to expect! ‘I also wanted to acknowledge the following, since announcing that we are expecting our baby. My heart goes out to anyone that this was a trigger for. ‘In the past few years, my world has been opened up to the realm of fertility & all the struggles that can come with it.’ ‘Be it, close friends or friends of friends etc, I have seen the struggles to conceive, the sad loss of babies & a whole world really that consumes your every day as a woman. ‘I am eternally grateful as I have already said for this blessing, & I want to make it clear we do not take it for granted & also send huge love to any ladies, & men out there that have not had an easy ride, as I know there are so so many of you.’ Jess added: ‘I still spend every day hoping this baby is fine & that we will be ok & even then that my baby is healthy & lives a full life, I promise it’s never ending!’ Got a story?
