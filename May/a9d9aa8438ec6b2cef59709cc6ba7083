The Spice Girls may be in different corners of the country but the group made sure to rally around Mel B this weekend as she celebrated her birthday. Mel turned 47 on Sunday and was made to feel the love by her fellow Wannabe singers Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Geri Horner and Mel C, who each posted sweet birthday messages for the star. Fashion designer Victoria shared a photo of her and Mel giving each other a warm hug while recently celebrating the star receiving an MBE, and wrote in her Instagram stories: ‘Happy birthday @officialmelb Kisses! x x.’ Mel C posted a funny photo of her covering Mel’s mouth during a stage performance, and said: ‘Happy Birthday Melanie! Hope you’re having an amazing day. I can’t wait to share the stage again with you ❤️✌🏼🥰 love ya xxx.’ Alongside a photo of her and Mel together, Geri wrote: ‘Happy Birthday !@officialmelb love you so much. Hope you have a amazing day !’ Emma posted a throwback of her and Mel hugging tightly, with the caption: ‘Happy birthday @officialmelb! 🎊 🎈 I get to call this strong, funny gorgeous woman one of my besties. How lucky am I. Love you darling, have the best day.’ Mel was quiet on her socials on Sunday but acknowledged her special day hours before, writing in a lengthy post: ‘Thank you [for] all your birthday wishes guys I’ve loved them dearly, I don’t really like my birthday day as my dad’s birthday was Yesterday God rest his soul. ‘I miss him beyond words could ever say always but it’s good to celebrate the day your born no matter what’s going on so hey happy birthday to me you today if it’s your birthday too.’ Supermodel Heidi Klum commented: ‘Happy Birthday I [love] U.’ This Morning presenter Alison Hammond said: ‘Happy Birthday Queen.’ Model and presenter Daisy Lowe joined in: ‘Happiest birthday beautiful.’ Mel has plenty to celebrate after receiving an MBE last month for her services to charitable causes and vulnerable women, having worked hard to raise awareness for domestic violence.
