The family of a Liverpool fan has issued an urgent appeal after he disappeared following the Champions League final in Paris. Joseph Murphy, 35, was last seen by his brother-in-law at 7pm yesterday at the fan park in the French capital. The game has been overshadowed by the chaotic crowd control of Liverpool fans outside the Stade de France before kick-off. Shocking footage showed fans being kettled by riot police and sprayed with tear gas – in what a UK force said was the ‘worst’ policing at a European game they had ever seen. Joseph’s wife Danielle Murphy told the Liverpool Echo he is a ‘hardworking dad to two little boys’ and urged him to make contact. In a tweet this morning, Joseph’s brother-in-law said they were ‘starting to get worried’ after hearing of the disturbing scenes. The tweet said: ‘Any Reds still in Paris…haven’t seen my brother-in-law since seven last night. Starting to get worried now with how much of a s**thole this place is and how bad the police are.’ Joseph was staying at 2 rue Mondetour, 94150, not far from the fan park. It’s believed he does not have a phone, and was wearing a Monterrain grey top, grey shorts, and was carrying a black rucksack. Anyone who comes across Joseph is urged to contact @Fran51131 on Twitter. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk. For more stories like this, check our news page.
