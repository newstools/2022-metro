The first case of monkeypox has been identified in Wales, Public Health Wales has said. It brings the total number of cases so far to 79 within the UK, The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) will give an update today about whether more cases have been identified. Dr Giri Shankar, director of health protection for Public Health Wales, said: ‘We are working with the UKHSA, Public Health Scotland, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland, and we are ready to respond to cases of monkeypox in Wales. ‘The case is being managed appropriately. To protect patient confidentiality, no further details relating to the patient will be disclosed.’ He added: ‘We are reassuring people that monkeypox does not usually spread easily between people, and the overall risk to the general public is low. ‘It is usually a mild self-limiting illness, and most people recover within a few weeks. However, severe illness can occur in some individuals.’ Despite the rise in cases, the UKHSA has said the risk to the overall UK population ‘remains low’. People with multiple sexual partners have been urged to be especially vigilant of any symptoms, as the disease can be spread by close contact. UKHSA teams have been tracing contacts of those with a confirmed case and are advising those at highest risk to isolate for 21 days. A smallpox vaccine is also being offered to close contacts to reduce their risk of symptoms and severe illness.
