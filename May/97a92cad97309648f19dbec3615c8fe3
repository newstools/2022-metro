Prepare for a freak out if you’re flying into Gatwick Airport anytime soon. A 60m ‘Welcome to Luton’ sign is visible on the approach to Gatwick – which is 60 miles south of Luton. Passenger Abbey Desmond said she was left in ‘a state of panic’ when she saw the letters in a field below, about 90 seconds before her plane landed. Another woman was left in horror as she had left her car at Gatwick. YouTube prankster Max Fosh has since come forward as the ‘pesky prankster’. Confessing on the Justin Dealey show on BBC Three Counties Radio, he has apologised if ‘anyone has been seriously thrown’. He was inspired by similar practical jokes in America and Australia. ‘It’s my job to make videos and my videos are all about doing silly things, to put a smile on people’s faces but just to be silly, I’m glad this stunt has gone down well’, he said. Max revealed he had gone around knocking on doors next to Heathrow and Gatwick, before a couple offered them a 80m long patch of land they didn’t have any use for. ‘I said “great can I get my tarpaulin out and start hammering pegs into the ground?”‘, he said. Putting up the 14 letters cost him £4,000 as it has been ‘made to last’. Luckily, travellers coming into Gatwick have seen the funny side of the sign, which will be there for six weeks. A photo Abbey posted went viral, gaining 28,000 likes on Twitter, with her writing that she wanted to ‘give everyone else a laugh’. Nic Day commented saying: ‘I am so glad people who do this sort of thing are alive. Makes me proud to be human!!’ Stephen Ratcliffe added: ‘Yes saw that when we landed on Friday.  Made us smile.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
