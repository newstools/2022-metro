It took a bit longer than expected, but the Elizabeth Line officially opened on May 24. The new line promises to ‘revolutionise’ travel in London as the Crossrail project expects to add around 10% more capacity to Transport for London (TfL)’s rail network and pump an estimated £42 billion into the UK economy (according to Mayor of London Sadiq Khan). Is the service operating seven days a week, though? Is it running on weekends? Currently, there is no Elizabeth Line Sunday service. The line is still in the opening phase, which sees 12 trains per hour between Paddington and Abbey Wood from Monday to Saturday 6.30am to 11pm. Work will continue being done across the line outside of these hours as the service will be completed, which will include more stations being made available (such as Bond Street becoming an Elizabeth Line stop later on in 2022). It’s reported that Sunday services will regularly be running by autumn 2022. The only Sunday service that the Elizabeth Line will be running in the immediate future will be over the Jubilee Bank Holiday weekend. Elizabeth Line services will run on Sunday, June 5 so tourists and locals can enjoy the festivities celebrating the Queen’s historic 70th year on the throne (which makes sense since the line was named after her, after all.) The Queen even made a surprise appearance to officially open the new line. Using a walking stick, the Queen met staff who have been key to the project. She was given an Oyster card and shown how to use it on a ticket machine and then unveiled a plaque stating that she ‘officially opened’ the Elizabeth line.
