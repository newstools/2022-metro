Another 14 cases of monkeypox have been identified in the UK, taking the total to 71. A rare outbreak of the smallpox-like disease is continuing to spread, alarming health officials around the world. The updated figures were confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which has continued to stress the risk to the UK population remains low despite the ‘significant and concerning’ spate of infections. Stocks of the smallpox vaccine are being bought by the government and offered to close contacts of confirmed infections. Those at the highest risk of contracting the disease are being asked to self-isolate at home for 21 days, with others warned to be on the lookout for symptoms. Transmission between people is occurring in the UK, with a large proportion of cases identified in the gay, bisexual and men who have sex with other men community. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. Leading global health experts are exploring the possibility that raves in Europe are fuelling the outbreak. Professor David Heymann, the World Health Organisation’s former assistant director-general for health security and environment, is reported to have said it is a leading theory among many under consideration.
