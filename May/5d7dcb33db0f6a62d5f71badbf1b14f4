Tinder is launching a pop-up pub experience this weekend, called The Bark & Spark, to let you bring your dog with you to your first date. Talk about putting the cute in meet-cute. In London, Manchester, and Edinburgh, daters will be able to bring their four-legged friends along for the fun on Saturday May 14 and Sunday May 15. Their needs will be catered to while you and your date get to know each other. Apparently, Tinder members who feature their beloved dog in their profile photos get 5% more matches, so think of them as adorable wingmen/women. The pubs taking part in the experience are the aptly named The Dog House, in London, The Dog and Partridge, in Manchester and Hare of the Dog, in Edinburgh. Laura Wilkinson-Rea, senior director of comms at Tinder UK says: ‘It’s clear that dogs are loved by Tinder members with 10% of our members including “dog lover” as one of their Interests on their Tinder profile. ‘That’s why we’re so excited to be bringing together dog lovers and their dates IRL by launching our first pop up pub experience, The Bark & Spark. ‘Answering singletons calls for shared experiences and providing a low-pressure way to make real-world connections, it really is a win for all four paws.’ You can also head to the ‘Animal Parent’ tile in Tinder’s Explore feature, where you’ll find fellow animal lovers looking for a match.
