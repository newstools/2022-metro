Sir Alex Ferguson admitted it was ‘absolute agony’ to present the League Managers Association (LMA) Manager of the Year award to Jurgen Klopp on Tuesday evening. Klopp guided Liverpool to second in the Premier League this season, finishing just a point behind champions Manchester City. However, having already won the Carabao Cup and the FA Cup this season, Klopp could secure this third trophy by the end of the week as Liverpool play Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday. Ferguson, who won the LMA Manager of the Year award five times during his career with Manchester United, was at the ceremony to present this season’s prize to Klopp. But as he announced Klopp’s name, the Scot joked: ‘This is agony, absolute agony.’ Ferguson then added: ‘I told him 12 years ago to go to a club with history. I should have told him to go to Scunthorpe United.’ After receiving the award, Klopp said: ‘It is a great honour and it was an insane season. ‘The last matchday when only two games were meaningless and in the rest, we all played for absolutely everything. ‘It was not the best outcome for us, but we are already over it. ‘When you win a prize like this you are either a genius or you have the best coaching staff in the world – and I am here with all of my coaching staff, they know how much I appreciate them.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
