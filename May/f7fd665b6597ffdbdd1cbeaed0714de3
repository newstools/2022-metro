A secret document suggests Americans could be soon stripped of the nationwide legal right to have an abortion in what would be a constitutional earthquake. Roe v Wade, the historic 1973 case that legalised the termination of pregnancies, may be about to fall after a majority of the court’s justices reportedly threw support behind striking it down. Individual states would be left to heavily regulate or ban the termination of pregnancies, a document labelled ‘Opinion of the Court’ allegedly shows. The draft opinion has been named an ‘abomination’ by the Senate Majority Leaders, while Hillary Clinton has warned it would ‘kill and subjugate women’. A Supreme Court spokeswoman refused to comment on the paper, originally published by Politico. While it’s unknown if the alleged draft opinion would mark the court’s final decision on the issue, a number of key passages from it have emerged. With a decision expected by late June or early July, here are seven important quotes from the paper, signed by Justice Samuel Alito. Abortion will likely become illegal in at least half of all US states if Roe v Wade is overturned, according to pro-reproductive rights group The Guttmacher Institute. At least 22 states already have laws that would come into effect, should the decision be officially adopted. Four other states are expected to pass new abortion bans in the near future, the organisation says. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
