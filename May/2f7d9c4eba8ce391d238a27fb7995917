Tens of thousands of drivers could be impacted as a consultation is launched on plans to expand London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez) to the entire city amid a ‘toxic air crisis’. Those who drive vehicles that don’t comply with minimum emissions standards may be charged a daily fee of £12.50 for entering anywhere in Greater London from August 29 next year. At the moment, the scheme’s boundaries cover the North and South Circular Roads. Analysis shows more than 3.5 million more people will live within the Ulez if it is increased in size, as proposed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan. Whether or not a vehicle is liable for the Ulez charge depends on how much nitrogen dioxide (NO2) it emits and the mayor’s office estimates an additional 135,000 vehicles would be affected per day. Pollution caused by London traffic is leading to nearly 4,000 premature deaths a year and children growing up with stunted lungs, a report from Mr Khan’s office said in January. Outer London boroughs have the greatest number of deaths attributable to air pollution due to the higher proportion of elderly people, a recent report by Imperial College London found. In 2019, the boroughs with the highest number of air pollution-related deaths were Bromley, Barnet, Croydon and Havering. NO2 damages lungs and can exacerbate existing conditions such as asthma and lung and heart disease. For diesel cars to avoid the charge they must generally have been registered after September 2015, while most petrol models registered from 2005 are exempt. Mr Khan previously ruled out introducing a Clean Air Charge, which would have affected drivers of all but the cleanest vehicles. He also decided not to go ahead with a proposal to charge drivers of vehicles registered outside London for entering the capital.
