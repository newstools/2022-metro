Little Mix star Leigh-Anne Pinnock and her fiancé Andre Gray are living it up in Jamaica as they celebrate six years together amid rumours they’re due to tie the knot this week. The Sweet Melody singer took to her Instagram stories on Saturday to share a photo and some video footage of herself with Andre at Mocha Fest in Negril, Jamaica. In a black and white printed cover-up, large visor shades and hoop earrings, Leigh-Anne leant in to her partner with her arm around his neck to give him a kiss on the cheek, while Andre smiled and pointed to the camera. She simply captioned the picture, ‘6 years 🥺❤️’ , before sharing a clip of them dancing together and sharing a kiss, on which she tagged Andre’s account. The couple got engaged in May 2020 when the Queens Park Rangers footballer made a romantic proposal in their garden during lockdown, but the pandemic complicated their wedding plans. However, sources now claim that Leigh-Anne and Andre, who welcomed their twins together last summer, are set to wed in Jamaica any day now. The couple, both 30, have just finished a busy time, with Andre wrapping up the football season and Leigh-Anne now officially on hiatus from Little Mix. An insider claimed: ‘Leigh-Anne and Andre have been planning their special day for months and this week they will finally tie the knot. ‘They chose to marry in Jamaica because of their family ties to the island, which they think of as their second home.’ They added to The Sun: ‘The ceremony is going to be very low key and romantic. It won’t have any of the hallmarks of the big celebrity weddings you see. ‘Leigh-Anne and Andre just want their closest network there to watch them say their vows.’ Leigh-Anne’s Little Mix bandmates Perrie Edwards and Jade Thirlwall are expected to attend with their respective partners, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jordan Stephens. Jade, 29, excited fans when she appeared to have jetted out to Jamaica on Tuesday after sharing a cryptic photo of her view from a plane. However, she has since updated her followers with a post from a trip to Budapest with Jordan. Got a story?
