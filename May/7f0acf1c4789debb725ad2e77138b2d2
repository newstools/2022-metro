A lion has become the mane attraction at a Chinese zoo after debuting a barnet that looks fresh from the salon. Hang Hang the lion is stopping people in their tracks with his new look, which some say looks like the iconic ‘mullet’ from the 1980s. It created such a stir that some visitors believe Guangzhou Zoo deliberately cut his hair in the style of Joe Exotic the Tiger King. But the zookeepers insist his golden locks were left limp and droopy by the 32C heat and 89% humidity. When Hang Hang licked his paws like the cat he is, he ended up straightening his hair and turning himself into a fashionista. ‘The hair style was purely nature’s magic,’ a zoo spokesperson said. ‘We wouldn’t dare cut the lion’s hair. He looked like a blonde supermodel with a fringe because of the high humidity in Guangzhou.’ Hang Hang is now attracting more visitors to the zoo who want their own pictures of his stylish ‘haircut’. ‘He’s the most beautiful boy here now, and more people are coming to see him,’ the spokesperson added. Temperatures in this part of south-eastern China have hit both extremes this month. Guangzhou recorded its coldest temperature of 13.7C on May 3, before it shot up to 32C three weeks later.
