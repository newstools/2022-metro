Tom Cruise mocked James Corden over his shock departure from The Late Late Show last night, joking that the host got ‘fired’. James, 43, announced he was leaving The Late Late Show after seven years but will continue to sit in the hot seat until 2023. Mission Impossible star Tom, 59, spoke to James from his dressing room before coming out to join the comedian on stage and consoled the Gavin and Stacey star for his sacking. (He did not get fired). ‘I’m here for you tonight whatever you need,’ Tom began. ‘I would not have fired you. I’m here for you if you need anything. ‘I just want you to know that I’m sorry.’ James hit back: ‘I would love it if you could lend me some money,’ even though he’s thought to have turned down $40million (£31.9m) to stay on the show. James confirmed he was ditching the progamme that made him a household name across the pond last week, to spend more time with his family here in the UK. ‘It’s been a really hard decision to leave because I’m so immensely proud of the show,’ he said. ‘I’m thrilled to be extending [for a year]. I always thought I’d do it for five years and then leave and then I stayed on. ‘I’ve really been thinking about it for a long time, thinking whether there might be one more adventure.’ The Carpool Karaoke king added: ‘My bosses here at CBS have been incredibly supportive and extraordinarily patient with me while I made this decision.’ Tearing up as he addressed viewers, he later promised to ‘go out with a bang’. Naturally, there’s been plenty of speculation that James quit The Late Late Show to concentrate on another Gavin and Stacey special while Doctor Who fans feart he could be replacing Jodie Whittaker as the Doctor. The Late Late Show airs weeknights on CBS in the US. Got a story?
