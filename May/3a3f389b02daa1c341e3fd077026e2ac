Liverpool star Mohamed Salah has been accused of ‘disrespecting the badge’ of Real Madrid after saying he wanted to face the Spaniards in the Champions League final instead of Manchester City. The Reds are seeking their seventh Champions League crown on Saturday when they take on the La Liga giants in Paris and they’re favourites to do so against Carlo Ancelotti’s men. Liverpool booked their spot in the final with a comprehensive win against Villarreal and they awaited the winner of Real Madrid against Manchester City, which the Spaniards trailed 3-2 on aggregate going into the second leg. Ahead of the tie, Salah said he wanted to face Madrid because he wanted to exact revenge on the Spaniards for Liverpool’s loss against them in 2018 – when he came off injured in the Kiev final. ‘I want to play Madrid, I have to be honest,’ Salah told BT Sport on May 3. ‘City are a really tough team, we played against them a few times this season, but I think if you ask me personally, I would prefer Madrid. ‘Because we lost in the final against them, I want to play against them, and hopefully win against them.’ Though Madrid do pose less of a threat than City, Valverde says the comments have shown a disrespect to his club and will act as motivation to beat the Reds in the French capital. ‘Obviously they’re words that everyone can take however they want,’ said Valverde.‘I’m his opponent and it’s like disrespecting the Real Madrid badge, the players… The only thing we must do is give our best, try to show why we’re in the final and let’s hope we can give another trophy to the fans and to Real Madrid.’ MORE : Why Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling missed Manchester City trophy parade For more stories like this, check our sport page.
