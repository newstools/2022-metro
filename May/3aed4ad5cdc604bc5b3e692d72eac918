Several people have been injured after a plane smashed into a busy motorway. The light aircraft ploughed into a car on the road before bursting into flames. Footage posted on social media showed the wreckage of the plane burning in the middle of the bridge. The Cessna aircraft was heading for Key West from Hollywood-Fort Lauderdale International Airport when it lost power, the Federal Aviation Administration reported. Two people aboard the plane were taken to a trauma center and three people with non-life threatening injuries were taken to a hospital. A sixth person is also believed to have been hurt but it’s unclear what condition they are in. It’s thought there was heavy traffic on the bridge at the time and the plane may have been attempting an emergency landing. At least one injured person could be seen in footage of the incident posted online. A witness who posted a video of the aftermath online said they saw three people getting out of the plane before it caught fire. Miami-Dade Fire Rescue said it was called at 12.50pm eastern time to the Collins Avenue bridge, according to the Miami Herald. A helicopter was drafted in to take the injured to a hospital, but it’s unclear how many needed medical attention. The paper said more than 60 firefighters were sent to the crash scene.
