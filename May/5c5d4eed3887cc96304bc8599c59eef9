We are taking a step closer towards a world where robots deliver food to our doorsteps. Food delivery service Uber Eats is launching two autonomous delivery pilots in the US on Monday. To begin with, the company is starting small and delivering food only from a few merchants in Los Angeles. One of the tests will focus on shorter trips in West Hollywood while the other will handle longer distance deliveries in Santa Monica, according to an Uber spokesperson. ‘We’ll be able to learn from both of those pilots what customers actually want, what merchants actually want and what makes sense for delivery as we start to integrate our platform with AV companies,’ they told TechCrunch. ‘The hope is that they’re successful and that we learn over the coming months, and then figure out how to scale.’ Food delivery using robots is part of a range of new products Uber is launching across its ride-hailing and food delivery platforms, which will be announced at today’s Global Product Event. During the event, the company showcased new products and features for its ride-hailing service including car rentals, 30-day windows for trip reservations, and multi-stop rides. For its delivery service, in addition to autonomous delivery, Uber Eats is integrating with Google Assistant to enable voice ordering and ordering at sports stadiums. To make autonomous food delivery possible, Uber has partnered with Serve Robotics, a robotic sidewalk delivery startup, and Motional, an Uber spinout. Uber announced its partnership with Motional in December, a firm which had previously worked on robotaxis with rival companies like Lyft.
