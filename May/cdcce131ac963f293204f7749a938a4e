Karim Benzema has accused Liverpool fans over being overconfident ahead of Saturday’s Champions League final against Real Madrid. The veteran striker is in the form of his life and has scored 16 goals in this season’s competition. Benzema’s deadly displays have already accounted for Paris Saint-Germain as well as Liverpool’s Premier League rivals Chelsea and Manchester City. The Reds are now firmly in the 34-year-old’s sights as he looks to enhance his Ballon d’Or credentials. Despite their record in the competition, however, Real Madrid will arrive in Paris as the slight underdogs ahead of their attempts to win a 14th Champions League title. Liverpool are in justifiably upbeat mood having won two cup competitions already this season and pushed City all the way in a thrilling Premier League title race. Benzema, however, has noted the mood of the Liverpool fanbase and believes the Anfield faithful are acting as if the trophy is already theirs. ‘Liverpool have a lot of confidence,’ Benzema told Movistar. ‘They think they have already won the match, maybe. ‘Maybe they think this isn’t the same Real Madrid as last time, these things. Maybe they think they’re favourites.’ Benzema also responded to Mohamed Salah who confirmed he was out for revenge after his involvement in the final four years ago was ended following the shoulder injury inflicted on him by Sergio Ramos. ‘Salah can say what he wants,’ added Benzema. ‘But this is a different game.’ MORE : PSG star Kylian Mbappe reveals he also held talks to join Premier League giants Liverpool MORE : Monaco chief sends transfer message to Liverpool and Real Madrid over Aurelien Tchouameni For more stories like this, check our sport page.
