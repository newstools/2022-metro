A woman has been left heartbroken after her puppy was run over and killed by two boys riding an e-scooter, who did not stop at the scene. Susan Leigh, 63, had taken her poodle pup Rupert out for a walk in Salford last week. She stopped at a bench to give Rupert a drink, and says the boys then sped towards them, driving straight over the dog and leaving him motionless. They glanced back but didn’t stop to help or apologise, she alleged. As Susan screamed for help, bystanders came over with one man offering to drive them to a vet. Nine-month-old Rupert was given CPR but sadly couldn’t be saved and died shortly afterwards. Susan told the Manchester Evening News: ‘There were two lads on the bike. They must have been going at least 20mph. ‘They looked around to see what they had hit and then just drove off. ‘I was shouting that I needed to get him off the path. He wasn’t moving and there was blood coming from him.’ Rupert was hit as they walked along the Walkden to Little Hulton Loop Line, which is a walking and cycling route. Her neighbour Cheryl said that any motor vehicle should not have been on the path. She added that Susan lived alone and her dog was ‘her life’. ‘She is absolutely devastated,’ she said. ‘She didn’t even hear the scooter coming they just appeared and rode over him it was that quick. That could have been a child.’ Greater Manchester Police said the incident had been reported to them and investigations were ongoing.
