A 79-year-old pensioner died after he slipped off a step ladder while using a chainsaw, neighbours have said. An ambulance was called to a home in the town of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, to reports of a ‘serious injury’ at around 11am on Friday morning. Multiple emergency crews found the man in ‘critical condition’ but he was tragically pronounced dead at the scene. The victim has not been publicly named and no details about how he died have been officially released yet. However, several locals who live near the man have said ‘the chainsaw he was using hit him after he slipped off the step ladder’. One neighbour said: ‘He was one of the kindest old fellas you could ever hope to meet. ‘He lived in the house with his wife. He was very proud of his garden and especially the look of his hedges. ‘It’s so sad. We are very close on this road and are really shocked by what happened.’ Plane watcher Andy Harrington was on his bicycle when he ended up following the air ambulance to the man’s house. Mr Harrington described an armed response arriving at the home. ‘I was told the armed officers are medically trained and were in the area at the time,’ Mr Harrington said. The local also said neighbours had told him the accident involved a chainsaw. Police are not treating the death as suspicious and a report has been prepared for the coroner.
