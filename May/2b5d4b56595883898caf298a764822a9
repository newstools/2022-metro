If you want to simplify the steps even further, you can poach your eggs in the microwave. To do this, first fill a microwave-safe mug or small bowl with approximately one-third of a cup water and a splash of vinegar. The vinegar is optional, but it helps the egg blend. Next, crack an egg into the mug or bowl, making sure it’s covered in water. After this, pierce the egg yolk with a fork or toothpick to prevent any explosions. Next, cover your mug or bowl with a small microwave-safe plate and microwave on high for one minute. The egg white should be set but the yolk still runny. If the egg white is still runny, keep microwaving in 10-second increments until it’s looking how you want it to. Remove the egg from the water with a slotted spoon and transfer it to a plate.
