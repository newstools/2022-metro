Downing Street denied blocking the treasury from imposing a windfall tax on oil and gas profits — as pressure built for ministers to ease the cost-of-living crisis with a package of support. The prime minister’s spokesman said he had seen ‘reports’ of division between the departments — but insisted Boris Johnson and chancellor Rishi Sunak are ‘aligned’. He added: ‘You’ve heard them both say effectively the same thing when it comes to these sorts of taxes. We want to see investment by these sorts of companies into British jobs.’ But Labour predicted a U-turn and accused the government of acting like ‘headless chickens’ as inflation and energy costs soar. And Confederation of British Industry boss Tony Danker urged Mr Sunak to act and ‘help the hardest hit now’. The chancellor has spoken of a ‘collective responsibility to help the most vulnerable’, but added he wanted to avoid damaging public finances. It came as policing minister Kit Malthouse warned officers not to show mercy to shoplifters stealing out of desperation. HM inspector of constabulary Andy Cooke had said there are ‘no two ways about’ poverty leading to more crime, and he supports officers ‘using their discretion’. But Mr Malthouse accused the watchdog head of ‘old-fashioned thinking’, telling LBC: ‘The law should be blind and officers should operate without fear or favour in prosecution of the law.’ Asked if ministers will ensure police do not turn a blind eye to people stealing food, he replied: ‘Absolutely right. In fact I wrote to chief constables just a year or so ago saying they should not be ignoring those seemingly small crimes.’ Money saving expert Martin Lewis told ITV ‘civil unrest’ could be on the horizon as Brits choose ‘whether they feed themselves or feed their children’.
