A chef has set a new world record for creating the largest-ever veggie Scotch egg — using a huge ostrich egg which took 90 minutes to boil. Leigh Evans, chef at egg producers Clarence Court, smashed the Guinness World Record with a 8.3kg (18lb) whopper, with a 1.7kg (4lb) egg at its core. Leigh made the savoury treat using his own unique recipe, including 1kg of grated cheddar, 2kg of breadcrumbs and nearly 5kg of peas. The entire process took more than six hours. Leigh, from Corsham in Wiltshire, broke the record as part of Clarence Court’s national vegetarian week celebrations this week. He said: ‘This was a first for me, having not created anything so large in my cooking career. ‘I always enjoy a challenge, and this was one that I really did enjoy doing. ‘I am delighted to have broken a Guinness World Record title and have had enormous fun creating this much-loved picnic staple.’ A Guinness adjudicator present during its cooking confirmed the triumph using industrial scales, supervised by two independent witnesses.
