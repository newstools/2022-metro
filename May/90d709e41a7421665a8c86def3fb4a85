One lucky ticket-holder’s life has changed forever after winning the £184million EuroMillions jackpot. It means they have become the biggest ever National Lottery winner, operator Camelot has said. Whoever they are, they have knocked the anonymous winner of £170million in October 2019 off the top spot. They have also become the National Lottery’s 14th winner of more than £100million. The winner, who is yet to be named, is also the second person in the UK to win the EuroMillions jackpot this year, after someone bagged £109million in February. The winning numbers were 3, 25, 27, 28 and 29 – plus the Lucky Star numbers 4 and 9. One ticket matched all seven numbers to win £184,262,899.10. Senior winners’ adviser for the National Lottery, Andy Carter said: ‘What an amazing night for one UK ticket-holder who has scooped the incredible £184million EuroMillions jackpot – they have become the UK’s biggest ever National Lottery winner. ‘Players are urged to check their tickets and give us a call if they think they are tonight’s lucky winner.’ Players of the National Lottery generate more than £30 million every week for projects, supporting everything from local charities to helping Team GB win Olympic and Paralympic medals. To date more than £45 billion has been raised and distributed to good cause. Last month previous winners Frances and Patrick Connolly shared how they have given away half of their £115 million fortune. Frances, a 55-year-old from Hartlepool who won the jackpot in 2019, said she gets a ‘buzz’ from being able to change people’s lives for the better, adding: ‘I’m addicted to it now.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
