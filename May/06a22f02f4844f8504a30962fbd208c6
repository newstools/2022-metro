Two football supporters have been charged following Manchester City’s Premier League victory over Aston Villa at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Thousands of City fans flooded onto the pitch after Pep Guardiola’s side came from behind to beat Villa 3-2 which secured their fourth Premier League title in five seasons. Supporters broke the goal at one end of the pitch while blue flares were also lit during the celebrations. Villa manager Steven Gerrard also revealed that his goalkeeper, Robin Olsen, was attacked by a City supporter as he made his way off the pitch during the invasion. A statement from Greater Manchester Police confirmed on Monday morning: ‘Phillip Maxwell, of Anzio Row, Knowsley, has been charged with throwing a missile (pyrotechnic) onto the pitch and will appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates’ Court today. ‘Paul Colbridge, of Whitegate Drive, Salford, has been charged with going onto the pitch and will appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates’ Court on 7 June 2022.’ Police have also said that enquiries into the reported assault of Villa goalkeeper Olsen are ongoing. When asked if his players got off the pitch safely after the game, Gerrard said: ‘No. My goalkeeper was attacked, I think you should ask Pep and Man City those questions. ‘We’re going to see how he is now.’ A statement from Man City on the incident read: ‘Manchester City would like to sincerely apologise to Aston Villa goalkeeper Robin Olsen, who was assaulted after the final whistle at today’s match when fans entered the pitch. ‘The club has launched an immediate investigation and once identified, the individual responsible will be issued with an indefinite stadium ban.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
