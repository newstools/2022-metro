Vladimir Putin has undergone surgery to remove fluid from his abdomen, an anti-Russian Telegram channel has claimed. Speculation about the Russian president’s poor health has intensified ever since he invaded Ukraine, with reports even alleging he is due to have a cancer operation ‘in the near future’. According to a post shared on Generall SVR, the 69-year-old Russian President used deep-fake technology and computer graphics to ‘create the illusion of his presence’ during an online meeting with his security council last week. The post further alleges some of the officials knew what was happening, while the rest were ‘so afraid’ of Putin they could not allow ‘the thought of substitution’. ‘Putin did not hold this meeting in real time,’ it said, claiming his introduction was recorded in advance. ‘I must say the “experiment” succeeded. ‘On the night of Thursday, May 12, to Friday, May 13, Putin underwent a surgical procedure to remove fluid from his abdomen. The procedure went normally without complications.’ Metro.co.uk has not been able to independently verify this claim, but very little information about Putin’s health comes out of the Kremlin, which insists he is in robust health. Critics say his mysterious disappearances, long tables, bloated face and trembling appearance suggest otherwise. Generall SVR, which has been linked to Russian political analyst Professor Valery Solovey, has made repeated assertions about the president’s medical condition over the last 18 months. These include that Putin is due to undergo surgery for abdominal cancer, that he has early Parkinson’s disease and a schizoaffective disorder. Prof Solovey – who boasts to have secret sources in the Kremlin – said in an interview with Zhivoi Gvozd Youtube channel: ‘It is an undeniable fact that [Putin] has a whole bunch of quite serious diseases.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
