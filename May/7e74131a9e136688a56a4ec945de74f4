This Morning guest Katie Hardwick revealed her passion for taxidermy on Friday’s episode, but viewers weren’t quite feeling the same after being shown mice in various ‘unnatural’ positions. Alison Hammond and Craig Doyle returned to the ITV mid-morning show to help get those at home ready for the weekend. However, one segment during today’s instalment didn’t go down so well with viewers, who voiced their concerns online. Towards the end of the episode, Alison and Dermot welcomed taxidermist Katie into the studio, who’d brought in a selection of her creations. These mainly involved a selection of mice, who she’d modelled into pole dancers. Understandably, this caused a bit of confusion amongst the hosts, as well as fans of the show. As Katie explained where her love of the hobby came from, Craig couldn’t help but ask: ‘Maybe I’m a little innocent, I’ve never been to a pole dancing mouse club before – and I kind of feel this way myself – this isn’t a natural position for the mouse. Is it respecting the dead animal? ‘At least when it’s in its natural position, it is respecting what it was great at and its beauty.’ He went on to quiz: ‘Is this maybe taking the mick out of them a little bit?’ ‘Understandably, some people do see it that way and that’s what a lot of people say online,’ Katie noted. But she defended the practice, adding: ‘I like to see it that every day I make these, I smile. I have so many people that say, “I bought it for my daughter and it was her favourite present ever”. ‘I just see it more as art. Personally, I think that they look beautiful,’ with Craig responding: ‘Art is there to cause controversy.’ Those watching shared their disgust, with one writing: ‘Actually making my skin crawl 😨😆 #ThisMorning.’ A viewer added: ‘I’d buy a mouse pole dancing as a cute talking point… if it’s synthetic. But a real stuffed one… the little bodies are freaking me out completely. Just eeew. #ThisMorning.’ ‘Just when I thought it couldn’t get any weirder 🤷‍♀️ #Thismorning,’ another weighed in. Someone else added: ‘I feel like Craig didn’t approve of the mice  #ThisMorning.’ ‘Not sure I would be smiling looking at a dead mouse hanging off a pole 🤔 prefer to watch a live one running around tbh #thismorning,’ agreed a Twitter user. Katie revealed around 80% of her customers are ‘from America’ but she has a huge variety in her clientele. While she mainly sticks to mice, she has tried out her skills on other animals before, adding: ‘I have done other animals but they’ve all been roadkill. I don’t have time to be trawling the roadkill.’ We think we’ll pass for now, though. This Morning airs weekdays from 10am on ITV. Got a story?
