Each tube line has its own identity that makes it special. Take the dust-filled table style seats of the Bakerloo or the modern bulletproof doors of the Jubilee; you don’t even need a map to know which route you’re on. The new Elizabeth Line opened to the public this week, so is still finding its identity among the stalwarts. But if its map colour and name is any indication, it seems like the keyword for Crossrail is regal. Rich purple joins the official rainbow of underground lines, with the iconic moquettes in shades of lilac, mauve, and black and white. The Elizabeth Line is also named after the Queen, who we hear is having something of a celebration soon. So rather than donning red, white, and blue to mark the Platinum Jubilee, why not pay homage in what we’re calling Crossrail Purple?
