The Queen’s Platinum Jubilee parade will be rounded off with a flypast of more than 70 military planes, jets and helicopters. Aircraft from the Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force will soar over Buckingham Palace on Thursday June 2, as Her Majesty watches from the balcony. The flypast will follow the Queen’s birthday parade, known as Trooping The Colour. However, the Queen’s balcony guest list is being limited to just working royals this time around, meaning Prince Andrew and Meghan Markle are set to miss out. While they may not be on the palace balcony, Harry, Meghan and their children will attend parts of the four-day Jubilee weekend, but it is not known which events they are going to. The Ministry of Defence said the famous Red Arrows will take part in the flypast, as well as military helicopters that responded to Kabul and Ukraine. It will take six minutes to fly the entire convoy over the crowds and it is expected to include more than three times the number of aircraft for the Queen’s last birthday parade in 2019. Trooping The Colour will feature a display of military pageantry involving 1,500 officers and soldiers and 250 horses from the Army’s Household Division on Horse Guards Parade. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said: ‘I’m proud that the Armed Forces are leading the nation in celebration with such a spectacular display. ‘Throughout the Platinum Jubilee celebrations we will all enjoy the expertise, skill and talent of our Armed Forces as we celebrate Her Majesty’s 70 years on the throne.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
