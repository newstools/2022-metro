Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp feels Erling Haaland’s expected summer arrival at Manchester City will ‘set new levels’ of competition. City are set to pay Haaland’s release clause in his Borussia Dortmund contract of €75 million (£64.2m) to bring the prolific forward to the Premier League. The 21-year-old has quickly established himself as one of the most feared strikers on the planet, scoring 85 goals in just 88 games since moving to Dortmund from RB Salzburg in January 2019. The Norwegian has already netted 154 times in his club career, while he has scored 15 times in 17 caps for his country. Competition was fierce for his signature this summer, especially at the relatively cheap price at which his release clause was set, and City will become an even more fearsome force with Haaland in their ranks. Klopp has just signed a contract extension at Liverpool stretching until 2026 and he says he is not disheartened that his fierce rivals are now even stronger, but does admit that Haaland will ‘set new levels’ for the Premier League champions. ‘I signed a new contract knowing that City will not stop developing. So it’s not about City to define if we can be happy or not, it’s about us,’ Klopp told Sky Sports. ‘If Erling Haaland goes there, it will not weaken them. Definitely not. ‘I know in the moment a lot of other people will talk about money, but this transfer will set new levels, let me say it like this.’ While the Haaland move to the Etihad has not been confirmed, the deal has reportedly been agreed and confirmation will arrive within the week.
