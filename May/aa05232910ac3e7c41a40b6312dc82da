Hungary’s third wife-carrying race attracted some 30 couples ready to put their relationship to a grueling test. Pictures show husbands carrying their wives on their backs facing deep-water hazards, muddy ground, hay bales and car tires on the 260 metre-long track on Saturday. As most Covid restrictions in Europe have been scrapped, unconventional sports have made a return. This one, it is believed, has its roots in the Viking age. England also holds annual competitions with similar obstacles. According to couples, the rough terrain requires balance, teamwork and a solid carrying technique. Participant Andras Toth said: ‘I think it is a lot more uncomfortable for my partner because the weight is on my shoulders so it is easy for me to run and I can balance.’ Indeed, it is not a trouble-free ride for the wives, who have to balance, often in awkward positions. Their head is also often dunked in muddy water during the race. Andras’ partner Eniko Darazsi, who was hanging off his shoulder, shared her strategy – ‘just take a deep breath’. Race organiser Gergo Guraly said: ‘I think the big interest is due to the fact that couples can leave their comfort zone of everyday life. ‘And when a couple completes the race in one unit they are very close to each other, so husband and wife can function as team builders here.’ In Finland, the race has taken place since the 1990s. Like any other sporting event, this one also comes with risks. In the 2018 event in England, a woman was injured when her partner slipped. She landed head-first and paramedics took her away on a spinal board with her neck in a brace. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
