A herd of cows have died after they wandered onto railway tracks and were struck by a train. The cattle were hit by a Great Western Railway (GWR) service near Yetminster yesterday. It has caused chaos for passengers in Somerset and Dorset, with all services passing between Yeovil Pen Mill and Weymouth cancelled until the end of the day. A clean-up operation is now removing the remains from the line, while engineers look for damage. Anyone who has already bought tickets can use them on South Western Railway services between Weymouth and Southampton Central. A GWR spokesperson said: ‘Following a train hitting several cows near Yetminster yesterday, a clean-up operation is in place. ‘Until this is complete, and Great Western Railway can ensure the line is not damaged, trains will be amended. ‘We anticipate disruption will continue until the end of the day.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
