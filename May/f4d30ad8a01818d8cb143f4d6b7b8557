A man in his 50s has died following a crash between a Bugatti supercar and an ambulance. The emergency services were scrambled to the A6, near the Barton Road junction, Bedfordshire, just before 6.30pm on Saturday. They were called to reports of a collision involving a blue Bugatti and an ambulance on blue lights. The man was pronounced dead at the scene on the northbound carriageway. Police have not made it clear which vehicle he was in. The victim has not yet been formally identified but his next of kin are being supported by specially-trained officers. Sergeant Tim Davies appealed for any witnesses to contact them. ‘Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the victim at this time,’ he said. ‘I would urge anyone to contact us as soon as possible if you witnessed the collision or were driving along the A6 at that time and saw the incident, especially if you have a dash cam fitted to your vehicle.’ Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
