EasyJet has said it will cancel more than 200 flights over the next 10 days, putting half-term breaks at risk for thousands of families and travellers. The airline said the cancellations would affect roughly 24 flights each day from London’s Gatwick airport between now and June 6. A spokeswoman for the company said in a statement: ‘We are very sorry for the late notice of some of these cancellations and inconvenience caused for customers booked on these flights, however we believe this is necessary to provide reliable services over this busy period. ‘Customers are being informed from today (Friday) and provided with the option to rebook their flight or receive a refund and can apply for compensation in line with regulations.’ It comes after a software failure forced EasyJet to cancel around 200 flights on Thursday. The disruption left holidaymakers stranded abroad and complaining about the lack of notice they were given. Others were stuck at some of the UK’s biggest airports, including Gatwick and Stansted. Elsewhere, Liverpool FC supporters travelling to the Champions League final and families embarking on half-term getaways faced long queues at the Port of Dover and UK airports. Thousands of fans descended on the Kent port on Friday to board cross-Channel ferries en route to Paris for Saturday’s match. Airline passengers were also stuck in lengthy queues at airports such as Gatwick, Manchester, Stansted and Bristol. There is also high demand for sailings from families embarking on trips to the continent for half-term. The port advised passengers to ‘pack adequate supplies including food and water’ as it is expecting ‘a very busy week ahead’. Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.
