Thibaut Courtois aimed a dig at English football fans after he delivered a man of the match display in Saturday’s Champions League final against Liverpool. The Belgium international joined the Spanish giants four years ago from Chelsea and initially took time to settle at the Bernabeu after dislodging the popular Keylor Navas. Since the return of manager Carlo Ancelotti in the summer, the 30-year-old has steadily rebuilt his reputation and is now back amongst the best goalkeepers in the world. Liverpool dominated large spells in Paris, but found Courtois in unbeatable form with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane in particular left dumbfounded by the goalkeeper’s agility and reflexes. Speaking after the match, Courtois offered a pointed response to his critics, saying: ‘Yesterday in the press conference I said that when Madrid plays finals they win. I was on the good side of history. ‘I saw a lot of tweets coming my way that I would get humbled today it was the other way round. ‘Today I needed to win a final for my career, for all the hard work to put respect on my name as I don’t think I get enough respect, especially in England. I saw a lot of criticism even after a great season. ‘I am really proud of the team. We stuck to it and when I needed to be there I was there for the team. ‘We beat some the best clubs of the world. City and Liverpool were unbelievable this season. They fought to the end in the Premier League, Liverpool won two cups and they were really strong. ‘We played a great game today. We had one chance and scored it.’ MORE : Real Madrid ruin Liverpool and Mohamed Salah’s Champions League revenge mission MORE : Why Karim Benzema’s Champions League final goal against Liverpool was disallowed For more stories like this, check our sport page.
