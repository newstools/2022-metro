It’s also great for destination weddings when temperatures will be higher. A full, volumised look that can be made more ‘bohemian’ with the addition of a flower headband and accessories. If your dress has a low back, this style can work will to draw attention to that. Add in a cuff at the top of the ponytail for extra interest and detailing.
