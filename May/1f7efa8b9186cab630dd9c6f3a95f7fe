Usually when you book a trip away, it’s to experience a change of scene and try something a little different. However, a certain listing on Airbnb takes this to new extremes. In fact, it’s perhaps one of the strangest listings to have ever graced the platform. Anyone looking to get away from it all can now stay in a room on a crane in Amsterdam. A pod that’s wedged inside an old harbour crane makes up the rental space – located on one of the city’s old industrial docks. However, it does boast some pretty amazing views of the IJ river. There’s surprisingly a lot of room inside, too, as the space is spread across three floors – with a bedroom, bathroom and kitchen, as well as dining and lounging areas. It’s also a stone’s throw away from the National Maritime Museum, the Hortus Botanicus gardens and the bars and restaurants of the Oost area. The Airbnb, which sleeps two guests, is currently being managed by ‘aparthotel’ company YAYS and there’s no denying it’s an alternative place to stay. That being said, due to its quirky nature, prices start from £350 per night. Although, the spot does has glowing reviews – so could be well-worth splashing the cash on. One person wrote: ‘A very special place in a very special setting. A crane right on the quay-side. Lots of windows to keep up with the goings-on in the very busy harbor. We found the accommodation cosy, clean and well-equipped.’ If you’re looking for other unusual Airbnbs – how about staying in the iconic Moulin Rouge windmill? Do you have a story to share?
