Former Australia cricketer Andrew Symonds had died in a car crash at the age of 46. Symonds made 238 appearances for Australia, establishing himself as one of the best and most popular white-ball players in the world in the 2000s. He scored almost 7,000 international runs – including eight centuries – and took 165 wickets across all formats. Symonds helped Australia win the World Cup in 2003 and 2007 and went on to work for Fox Sports as a pundit after retiring from playing in 2009. His tragic passing comes two months after Australia cricket legend Shane Warne died at the age of 52. Police say Symonds was involved in a single-car accident at 10.30pm on Saturday night at Hervey Range, west of Townsville on Queensland’s east coast, where his  vehicle left the road and rolled over. Paramedics tried to revive the Australia hero but he sadly died. Symonds’ family have confirmed his death and thanked friends and fans for their sympathy and support. Australia legend Adam Gilchrist, who regularly played alongside Symonds, said on social media: ‘This really hurts.’ Former Baggy Greens bowler Jason Gillespie added: ‘Horrendous news to wake up to. Utterly devastated. We are all gonna miss you mate.’ Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan, meanwhile, said: ‘Simmo… this doesn’t feel real.’ For more stories like this, check our sport page.
