Huge crowds descended on the home of an alleged paedophile in Scotland last night. People in Moodiesburn, North Lanarkshire, gathered and chanted towards the house. The mob was only dispersed once emergency services arrived. In footage from the incident, a number of police cars and vans can be seen blocking the group from the home. Shouts from the crowds can be heard in the clip as police dogs bark and car horns sound. The mob shouted ‘paedo protectors’ and ‘f****** paedo’ at points during the video. The group then cheer as a police van drives away from the home. One local told the Scottish Sun: ‘We’re a great a community coming together to protect its children and people from such vile people.’ No arrests were made following the incident. A Police Scotland spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: ‘Officers were called to a disturbance on Cumbernauld Road, Moodiesburn, around 6.10pm on Monday, May 2. ‘No arrests were made and no-one was injured.
