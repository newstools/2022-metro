Cristiano Ronaldo and his partner Georgina Rodriguez have announced the name of their baby daughter following the death of their son. The Manchester United star, 37, and his girlfriend revealed in October they were expecting twins, with Georgina giving birth to a boy and a girl in April. However their newborn son did not survive the delivery. During their incredible loss, Cristiano and Georgina have been keeping fans updated on social media, including a poignant post where the sports star thanked his 436million followers for their ‘kind words and gestures’. The couple also shared photograph of the family, including their four other children, at home together with their new daughter and sister. Now Georgina has shared new photographs of their newborn baby girl, along with revealing her name for the first time. Taking to Instagram, the mum-of-four wrote simply: ‘Bella Esmeralda 💚,’ along with her date of birth: April 18, 2022. One sweet snap shows baby Bella asleep with a smile on her face, wrapped up warm in white-and-pink clothes and covered in a blanket, while another shows her flat on her back, sleeping in a pink cardigan. A final bittersweet photograph shows Bella in hospital shortly after her birth, wearing a pink knitted hat to keep warm, with Georgina’s hand laying protectively on her. The gorgeous post resulted in an outpouring of love for the new parents, having garnered close to 4 million likes in a matter of hours. Cristiano and Georgina share daughter Alana, three, and Cristiano is also father to Cristiano Jnr, 11, and twins Eva and Mateo, four, who he had via unknown surrogates in the United States. Last month, the couple revealed the devastating news that they had lost their son with a statement via social media. They wrote: ‘It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that our baby boy has passed away. ‘It is the greatest pain that any parent can feel.’ They continued: ‘Only the birth of our baby girl gives us the strength to live this moment with some hope and happiness. ‘We would like to thank the doctors and nurses for all their expert care and support. We are all devastated at this loss and we kindly ask for privacy at this very difficult time.’ Portugese footballer Cristiano later shared a sweet photograph of him holding his baby girl, with her curled up asleep in his arms. He captioned the post: ‘Forever Love,’ followed by a praying hands and heart emoji. The pair had revealed the sex of their children in December with a celebratory gender reveal party. Revealing that they were expecting both a boy and a girl, the couple posted a joyful video of their kids popping balloons, with pink and blue confetti bursting out. ‘Where life begins and love never ends ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ #blessed,’ the pair captioned their Instagram posts.
