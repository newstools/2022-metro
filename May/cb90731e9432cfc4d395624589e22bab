A man has been left with serious injuries after being stabbed following a crash which saw a car flip over. It is believed someone living nearby, who was woken by the crash outside their home in Herne Bay, helped the injured man until ambulances arrived. A resident living nearby told local publication KentOnline: ‘I noticed it at 7.20am. ‘I was busy at the table and then I saw lots of police cars, ambulances, fire engines coming in. ‘It’s just an ordinary, quiet residential area, so there’s nothing like this that this goes on. ‘I’m shocked this has happened here.’ Police, paramedics and the fire service rushed to Stanley Road in the Kent town just after 7am this morning. Officers said the man was stabbed following a two-car crash along the street. The road remains closed while detectives try to piece together what happened. The man’s injuries are understood to be serious, but not life-threatening. A Kent Police spokesperson said: ‘We were called to Stanley Road following a report of a two-car collision followed by an assault. ‘A man was taken to a London hospital with an injury consistent with a stab wound. ‘Our investigation is ongoing and a section of Stanley Road is currently closed, as well as an alleyway off Canterbury Road, while officers conduct enquiries.’ Anyone with any information about the incident can call 101, quoting reference number 03-0150.
